4.0,No white background! It’s clear!,I bought this bc I thought it had the nice white background. Turns out it’s clear & since my phone is blue it doesn’t look anything like this.  If I had known that I would have purchased something else. It works ok.,1612044451196,0,True

5.0,Worked but took an hour to install,Overall very happy with the end result. If you hate puzzles don’t do it. I love puzzles and it worked for me. Took a lot of concentration and attention to detail and about an hour! The YouTube video helped a ton with installing the new screen. Highly recommend using a how to video when replacing your screen. The tools and supplies they provided were adequate. I did use additional tools from my home to successfully installed a new screen. My screws on the inside of the iPhone were stuck and I had to use an X-Acto knife to get them to come out. The glass Screen for the iPhone was beautiful and worked great. The screen protector that was additional came cracked (Not a big deal as it was extra in my eyes). I did need to use the X-Acto knife to cut off part of a plastic piece to make the final fit. So yes I modified the screen and instructions but ended up working great for me.<br /><br />I was very careful with all of the circuit boards and connections as recommended on the YouTube video. My screen replacement was very successful and I’m very happy with how it turned out.,1629235304798,3,True

5.0,One of my absolute favorites,"I had the standard red rubber wristband for my apple iwatch that I had used for months. Around Christmas I picked out a cute Christmas band which I wore until the season was over. Beginning of January, I ordered a new set of bands which were terrible (see reviews) and I couldn't get them to work. Anyway, I saw this band and had my fingers crossed it would be different. To my surprise it was! Super easy to install (unlike the last one), fits and adjusted to my wrist perfectly. The band (although rubber type as well) has a great ribbed look which makes it look different and fashionable. I got it in white and it looks great with the red face of my iwatch. I am finally wearing my watch again. This is a great band and recommend to everyone!",1674481573889,0,False
3.0,I couldn't use these,"This is next to impossible for me (68 year old woman) to get these on my wrist. I still cannot get these to fit right and I can't even get them to snap closed properly.

5.0,Great way to provide additional charging capabilities to your devices!,"I was excited to get this powerbank for multiple reasons. First, I live in Florida where power outages intermittently occur but especially during hurricanes. Second, I travel a lot and love to take videos and photos with my iPhone XR. This powerbank helps me with both purposes. I recently went on a cruise to the Caribbean where I was off the ship many times without access to power. I kept this device in my purse and as soon as I could see the power getting critically low, I was easily able to recharge my phone and continue with my explorations. I have not experienced any hurricanes yet since I have owned this but, as we are in August and quickly approaching the highest part of hurricane season, I am thrilled to know that if I was to lose power I have at least a way to continue to keep in touch with friends and relatives!",1565870839348,0,False

Having this with me helps extend the use of my iPhone and I don't need to be running around trying to find an outlet (especially when I am stuck at the airport or outdoors). Highly recommend.

5.0,"Great portable battery charger, every home should own one",This is a great extended battery pack. Used it on a recent 3 week trip to Europe for times when I was away from my charger (and electricity). I love to use my phone almost exclusively for picture and video taking and the videos really ate away at my phone battery. I found this portable charger just what I needed to allow myself almost a full day of use without worrying about plugging in. Highly recommend this and I think everyone should own one.This will also come in handy in my house now that Florida is entering storm season and we frequently lose power.

5.0,Great phone protection!,"I have to qualify this review by stating my last phone was an Iphone5s that I had for at least 4 years. Through the years, the phone had been dropped several times which resulted in phone damage and cracked glass. Luckily, the iPhone still worked but I promised myself that my next phone I would take better care of (especially because of the $$). So, I finally upgraded to the iPhone XR in February and decided to try this case. I will tell you it is great. Easy to install around my phone, I find it a great way to protect my latest investment. I honestly have already dropped (actually it slipped out of my hands) the phone and there is not a ding or a scratch on the phone (probably due to the heavy duty bumper). It also looks great and is an attractive investment in a long future with this phone.",1555768000743,0,False

4.0,"Great case, is as advertised, prone to scratches","Nice looking case. I like the storage capability for credit cards and cash. I have used it when I am out on my bike, going to the stores, so I don't have to try to lug a handbag or something else. Not crazy about the extra bulk this adds to the iphone (despite the claim that it is minimal), but I guess it's the price you pay for the storage capability and protection). This is well built, sturdy and does protect the phone well. As others have mentioned, it is prone to scratches (I have seen several on mine already and I don't even remember doing anything rough to cause them). Rating this a four star, as it does what it says. Like I mentioned, my biggest complaint is the slight bulk to the phone added and maybe the price (I think you can do better than $40 for a phone case out there).",1413842290000,0,False

It protects my phone (top and bottom) and seamlessly hugs the device tightly (yet I am still able to use a headset and fit the charger in easily).

I plugged my phone in at 27% and within 45 minutes it was already at 60% reported charge (Samsung Galaxy S5 active (2800 mAh).  Of course I know that will drop a bit once it's taken off the charger but I think this will work perfectly for his trip. As other reviewers have mentioned the pocket is useless for anything other than the included cable.  What I found to work best was used that flap to make a tent of sort of one of the solar panels and place the phone under there in the shade so the battery wouldn't get too hot from sitting in the sun.  this worked great in that configuration. It will also work good to strap it to top of his backpack and get a longer cable to place battery pack inside the top pocket of his pack to be able to take advantage of the sunny spots on the trail.

I hold the phone in my left hand, using the pop up grip and use my right hand to navigate and use my phone... I am not a ""thumber""  You can stand you phone up with this one.. it pops out in about 3 different heights.. I like that because I can keep my phone off the table or other surfaces that might not be clean.  The design I chose sort of matches my cover... the ONE down side is that I cannot use my cordless charger.. for whatever reason, I am guessing it's because the grip lifts is just enough off the stand and it doesn't make contact.  Eh.  I got tired of taking my cover on and off every night, so I went back to cord charging.  I purchased another cover so I could go back to the cordless charger and not use the grip - but for now I am liking it.

Another note: once you peel off the sticker and place it on your outer case, whatever that is, you will NOT be removing it or moving the grip.  It's on - permanently.  So be certain about where you place it.  Having said all of that, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.",1553918628415,0,True

5.0,samsung galaxy s10+ cover,"I just got my brand new Samsung Galaxy s10+ - and this the same cover I loved and used for years on my galaxy s7!  I love the print.. I love the look.  Here's the thing... the best part about this cover print?  Its printed on the INSIDE!!  That means the print will STAY on a LOT longer than those that are printed on the outside of the case.  Trust me on this.  In any case, I am thrilled that the print I loved for all these years, the reliability of the case and funtionality is still available to me.  I have the black phone.  So the print really shows nicely.  I mostly use wireless charging platforms, and it easily charges through the case without any issue. When I have plugged into the phone with my car cord, no issues - stays plugged in while in the case. LITTLE TIP:  I actually put the little SD ""key"" inside the case as it usually gets lost -  it fits easily inside the case, is fairly hidden in the print and doesn't move around.  The case is firm, but not brittle plastic.. it's a bit rubbery so it fits the phone perfectly and protects from the daily bumps and grinds with a little lip/edge and reinforced at the corners.  It does NOT hinder the function of the phone at the edges at all.  I love it.  Having said all of that... I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.",1552423971475,12,True
5.0,battery bank,"Purchased two of these... a few weeks a part.  One I take with me in my purse for emergency tablet or cell phone charging... the main reason for purchasing this was to run my art light board.  It comes with a a kind of wanky cord, so I replace with a sturdier, better quality braided cord.  My cord is also shorter which works better for me.  It takes quite a bit of time to fully charge the first time, seems like less now... but maybe I don't let it get completely drained before recharging.  In my use... the light board takes very little power so it lasts and lasts and lasts.  I have used to charge my cell (samsung galaxy s7) once... quickly and fully with plenty of charge remaining - again, I use my better quality cord. It is about the size of a deck of cards - maybe slightly larger.  It is about 3/4&#34; thick... and it weighs a fair amount, but, compared to some others I purchased a few years ago, this one is so much smaller and lighter.  If you need a battery bank... I would feel comfortable recommending this one.  Having said that... I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seems useful... we'll see about longevity.

If you have a really thick case it might not fit in the little lower lip, but probably could still rest above it.  The base has two little rubber spots to help it stay put on slippery surfaces. You can set the easel back to any position that works using the side button (on the top of the easel - left hand side).  It is a flat black in color. The only other thing I could say about it is that is fairly heavy.  I had a pouch from something else and I drop into that to carry about. It adds significant weight to my purse, so I don't carry it everywhere.  It's sturdy!  I never hesitate to update my review should new info see useful.",1501275082616,1,True

Soo... right off the bat, this one is WAY ahead of the game with the pattern printed on the inside of the case... NO rub off.  Next, the corners are &#34;reinforced&#34;... they are a little taller than the rest of the case... protecting your corners.  I was at the store when my phone slipped from my hand onto the cement floor... about a 5' drop.  It landed on a corner and NO breakage!  Because the corners are higher than the main body it protects the front of the phone.  The plastic is a little rubbery feeling... It fits snugly but it is easy to put on and off.

4.0,"""Samsung"" Fast Charge Stand","We've all heard about counterfeit goods out there.... I really don't know if these are real or not... but here are my thoughts.... I purchased my first one of these at the Sprint Store when I purchased my Galaxy 7 a month ago. I do love the ease and FAST charging ability. My phone is fully charged in about 1 hour. I purchased the black, two of them through Amazon. They both arrived with WHITE cords.... odd..... ?? The cords have a mini usb tip on one side, you plug into the stand itself (or, in a pinch directly into your phone - although it wouldn't be a &#34;fast charge I don't think), the other end is a large usb tip that can be plugged into a computer, or other large usb charging receptacle OR to the wall unit that works in a regular plug in. The cord feels sturdy so it should last. It's about 2ft in length - just eyeballing it. It doesn't seem to effect the charging ability that the cord color doesn't match the base... I noticed that the one I purchased from Sprint had matching color cord... and is silent (there is a small fan). One of the these is a bit noisier - you can hear the fan every so often. So I just moved that one away from the bedroom. Honestly I am suspicious of them - ... but they do work and nothing has caught fire ... yet. I would use caution.",1477786106000,1,True
4.0,Cell phone car holder,"I have a 2006 Lexus GX...  I wanted a holder for my phone that didn't use a magnet.  This holder fits that criteria. I have a Galaxy S7 and it fits nicely in the holder.  The holder itself is black.  It has a sticky, suction base.  The base has 2 adjustment spots...both are twist/screw type...  loosen, adjust and then tighten.  The top adjustment is like a ball swivel with a small amount of swivel.  The actual grabber area is interesting... you push in two tabs on opposite sides and the grippers pop open.  There is a &#34;button&#34; like knob in the center so that when you place your phone in the cradle it snaps the side pieces in place, grabbing and holding the phone.  I find that the side buttons sometimes are not very &#34;positive&#34; and you need to press them both equally at the same time or you will need to press the center button to reset and press again to get your phone positioned properly in the holding area.  There is also a loose, free moving bottom &#34;lip&#34; or &#34;edge&#34; that helps to hold the phone in place.  The circular base bottom is very, very sticky and has a reverse pressure lever.  It is VERY solid.<br />I was disappointed to see that the box I received had been opened and the item had been &#34;used.&#34;  That being said, it does work.

Otherwise they slip all over the place.  It folds flat so nicely you can easily carry in your purse to use when you're lunching alone and reading or shopping or playing a game... A couple of down notes... the adjustable angle lever does NOT stay in place well and it would be so cool if they would &#34;snap&#34; in to help them stay where you set them... also the ledge you set your device in (I have an LG4) is a slippery surface, so you if you have a plastic case (as I do) on your device, it will resist &#34;staying&#34; on the ledge... so a bigger ledge trough or silicone lining in the trough (?) would help a lot.  On the other hand, you're getting a bunch of these (9) in lots of wonderful colors, so the price is good.  Over all, it's handy.  With a few minor tweaks it could be a 5-star item in my opinion.

1.0,Would not purchase again,"As with other reviewers, I report that the case does read &#34;made in korea&#34; inside... probably NOT LG. The &#34;G4&#34; shown embossed in the ad picture is NOT on the case.  The sticker on the box says &#34;genuine OEM Original LG Leather.&#34;  Probably not.  And most likely NOT leather.  The outside is NOT at all &#34;soft&#34; as reported by another reviewer... at least mine is not.  It is textured and hard. It is &#34;matte&#34; finished, sort of leather &#34;like.&#34;  The inside is a plastic-like material, no way to really see if the outside is leather or just a textured plastic itself.  It does fit, all the slots and holes are accurate. I have a sparkle/clear outer case (purchased at the Sprint store when I got the phone) that I use over the whole backside that provides a rubber bumper that covers the edges completely and then the outer plastic cover also provides a &#34;lip&#34; that protects the glass if the phone is dropped.  The pink shows through nicely, tho it is a very light pink. I think the photo is fairly close to reality (at least to the one I received). In my opinion, you'll be paying $70 for a back that is worth about $5 and that is being very generous.  Honestly, I would pass unless you just really want the &#34;look&#34; they advertise on TV all the time.  However reviews are ALL subjective and personal.  Everyone should make choices and decide for themselves. I will update with any wear or other issues. I hope this has helped in some way even if you don't agree.

It holds your cell sideways... so if you're using it like a GPS using google maps/drive or something like that it's just right.  Just depends how you like to see your phone.  I don't text while I drive, but sometimes use the speaker phone capability.  The red tabs are harder... not foam, but the jaws grip securely... at least for my phone which is slightly smaller than a Note.  There is a lever in the back that swivels the pincher... that's nice.

3.0,"Two words: ""good"" but ""overpriced""","This is an update AFTER I have purchased the honor 8 (with a heavy discount from manufacturer)<br /><br />Everything else is as most people have observed: quality build, smooth, ample memory ...<br /><br />However, one BIG complaint I have is the dual sim - Huawei's own manual (on model FRD-L04) says it CAN be used as dual-sim (or one sim and one sd card), numerous reviews said it support dual-sim, but it doesn't from what I can tell.<br /><br />why Huawei doesn't support more LTE bands, just like they do on Mate 9??<br /><br />Another issue is with dual camera - the wide aperture is a great misnomer, wide aperture on smart phone won't give you the bokeh effect, iphone's &#34;portrait&#34; mode is much easier on usability.<br /><br />---<br /><br />I bought Honor 5x as soon as it was out on Amazon: it was a good value proposition at the time. Not so for Honor 8.<br /><br />Honor 8 - I have hands-on experience, it is a step-up from Honor 5x, but not a $200 or double-priced step up.<br />Most folks who bought the Huawei phone are not because it is really better than iPhone at half the price (though I am sure Huawei wants you to think that way). Yes, it is beautifully designed, and I like 5.2 form factor more than 5.5. The dual camera is nice - but it is not pulling ahead of either iPhone or Samsung. All in all, a good step-up from Honor 5x released in US. That comes to my second point - it is an overpriced phone.<br /><br />The same phone or other similarly configured phone (from Xiaomi, Le2 etc) will cost about $50 to $100 less, which is significant in this price range. Huawei set this price simply because they can (and a bit greedy since this is US market). No other its fellow competitors from home  have released their phones in the US, yet. There maybe some pride on Huawei's part on about its reputation and quality that they think worth the extra. This is not so in my mind: I haven't seen any phone other than iPhone that can enjoy software update for more than 3 years, and hardware can withstand it. Given my experience with Honor 5x, Huawei is no exception either.  The bottom line is, I think this is over-priced phone, a bit over 300 or even 350 would have made its name and be more competitive.",1473094741000,5,False

Hoping for Marshmallow update.<br /><br />Update: after a month, Honor 5X received its first update and it is a letdown ... First, the update itself is a 125MB package without any note on what it is for; Second, and more important to the take off of one star: after the update, two apps are added and put on, both seems to be advertisement, one is hotel booking, the other is a link to store.

The style is good for men.<br /><br />The one down side is that my size is between links.

It's like a very small phablet, light enough that you can hold it for an hour or more late at night if you want to catch up on reading or dash off emails you couldn't get to during the day.

5.0,Helpful information for this great plugin and  foreign made cars.,"It is great in American cars, not so in European cars. I found out the hard way when I traveled when to a dealer was told Europen cars like VW, BMW, and Mercedes many others who are made in Europe have only 10 Volt when this is plugged in. Americans make their cars for 12 volts. I took this could from our American car to Europe, and so I found out it does not work, you have to order a plugin from your dealer which he orders from Europe. I own a Mercedes, VW GTI never used it in these cars only in my American made car. This will solve a lot of problems for you people with foreign cars it is not the plugin it is the European car. I hope this helps. Never take one to other countries or use it only in an American car. ( My husband has to plug his oxygen machine into the outlet and I used it for my phone in our Ford.

4.0,"Bad at most things, but a great phone for the price.","This phone is cheap. It runs an ancient version of Android, can barely run an app and make a phone call at the same time, and is losing compatibility with some basic apps that I used to use every day (e.g. banking). On top of all of this, the sound quality is fair at best, and you can't run bluetooth and wifi at the same time without them interfering with each other (they sit on the same chip).<br /><br />Despite all of the negative remarks above, I have had this phone for 3 years. 3 years! I've never had a phone last that long, let alone one I bought for $60 with no contract. It takes a beating, and still delivers in some key areas:<br /><br />First, the battery. This battery is insane (probably because the processor is so weak it doesn't draw any power...). I can forget to charge the phone overnight, and I'll still have a charge the next afternoon.<br /><br />Second, the durability. I have dropped this phone more times than I can count. Heck, I've even thrown it against the wall to prove a point to gloating iPhone owners. In spite of all that, it keeps ticking. Small cracks on the back cover are the only sign of wear. With the beating I give it, I would expect  it to look like Humpty Dumpty (post-fall).<br /><br />Lastly, size. This phone is very small for a smart phone. It's so cheap I don't bother with a case, and it fits very easily in a hand or pocket.<br /><br />To summarize:<br /><br />This is a great cheap phone. In spite of all of its shortcomings, it can call, text, and send emails. It can even load simple web pages (good luck if there are ads though...). If you just want a sturdy little phone that will get you through the day and then some, this is a fine choice. However, if you rely on apps, need to make business calls, or want a fancy gadget, you will be seriously disappointed.",1457743338000,0,False

4.0,"Quality Item, but may not protect sides of the glass as well as other cases","This is the first OtterBox case I have tried.  The quality seems quite good and case fits good around the Samsung Note 8 phone.  A couple of cases I tried before seemed to come up around the edges too much, so that you couldn't use a glass protector, as the case would interfere with the protector and it would not sit tight to the glass.  This case seems to be designed in such a way that you could use a glass protector.  The problem is that because the case doesn't really cover the edges that well, if you were to drop the phone on the edge, it might break the glass. (Glass replacement for this phone is about $400 I have been told.)  I prefer a case that has a cover too, rather than a one sided case like this.  The problem with cases with a cover is that you always have to deal with the cover.  It can be a separate piece that you have to set aside when using the phone or a billfold type that you open up and then the cover is in your way when taking pictures.  If you like single sided cases so that your phone is always open for use, this is probably one of the best you can get.",1528755841453,0,False
5.0,"Lightweight, but offers good protection with a cover; can hold several credit cards and picture ID","This is a really nice case that holds a picture ID and several credit cards and provides an easy fold cover to protect the screen with a magnet to hold it closed. It is almost like a folding wallet.  If you have this phone (Note 8), you know that the glass is curved on the edges, so it is difficult to find a screen protector that doesn't provide full coverage and doesn't go around the curved edges.  The problem with a full coverage glass protector is that just about any case that you try needs to press against the sides of the glass to hold the phone properly.  That creates a problem because the pressure of a case on the sides raises the protector off the surface of the glass.  With this case, you don't absolutely need a screen protector, as you have protection once the case is closed.  I have tried two other cases and so far I like this the best of the three.  The case is nice and thick, but soft leather, so should provide enough protection without the weight that a hard cover case would have.  I like it a lot and if this wears out, I'll buy the same case again.",1518144431693,0,False
4.0,"Attractive, fits well, may not provide full protection of the glass face","Very attractive case and it fits like a glove.  The credit card holder is a plus.  Found it very easy to put on and remove.  The only question is whether or not it provides adequate protection.  I noticed that the rounded glass face on the Note 8 sticks slightly above the edge of this case.  If the phone were dropped on its face, the face could probably crack because of this.  Naturally I didn't try it to find out.  I generally prefer cases that have a cover, to provide much better protection of the face of the phone, which is more prone to breaking than other parts of the phone.  This is a single part case that essentially protects sides, ends and back of the phone, but seems to not provide much protection for the front of the phone.",1516675009754,0,False
4.0,Very rigid cover; good quality; partially works on earlier Stylo phone,"I ordered this for my LG G Stylo phone, but it was designed for a Stylo 2, which is apparently just slightly different.  It does fit my phone, but it partially covers the camera flash and completely covers the laser detection auto focus. I believe it also covers the headphone jack. All the other holes line up okay (microphone, charging port, speaker and hole for the stylus).  All the front openings are available because this is a one-sided case.  If you don't use the camera that much or the headphone jack (which I don't), you could make it work.  It is very rigid, so it seems as if it would be very durable and long lasting.  Because it is a completely rigid case, it was a little difficult to slip the phone into it and I may have cracked the back cover of the phone (the battery cover).  It's possible that it was already cracked from dropping the phone a few times, but I know I made several of the cracks worse putting it in the case and then removing the case.  When I first removed the case, it pulled the back off the phone, in fact.  Possibly the fit might not be quite as tight on a Stylo 2, but if it was not a good firm fit, the case would not stay in place.  My suggestion - once you have it in the case, don't remove it, unless you have to in order to get to the battery or memory card inside your phone.  The only thing that I really didn't like is that this is a one sided case that covers only the back, ends and side of the phone but not the front.  My current case has a cover, to cover the front of the phone as well, so it protects it much better.  My attempts to fit this case to a phone that it wasn't quite designed for should not impact your decision to buy this case.  All I would say is to just be careful inserting it into the case, so as not to flex the phone at all, which might crack the back phone cover (the battery cover) as it did mine.  I wasn't keen on the pink color, but you can order this in other colors.",1509905592875,0,False

Again, I've had other wallets that grip the phone when reconnected. This one feels not as strong. However, the snap closure prevents the phone from detaching in a fall which helps. So, I try not walk around  too much with it open. The case itself is thin enough to allow QI charging on the pad and in my vehicle. I can drop it in to the slot and it fits allows for fast charging.

My only complaint is that the white color shows every speck of dirt and looks rather filthy quickly; a quick wipe down with an antibacterial wipe takes off most of the grime.",1526675518577,0,False
4.0,Great-looking case that complements your iPhone 6,"I preordered mine and received it on Sept. 19, the same day my iPhone 6 arrived. The color (I chose champagne / champagne) matches the phone perfectly. The case is very light with a sleek profile that makes you forget it's a case at all. Finishing is excellent; there are no rough seams, corners, or edges. After reading that several people had issues with Elago Outfit cases scratching their iPhone 5, I left the protective film on the back of my phone just in case, but don't plan on removing this case until I trade my phone in in a year or two.<br /><br />At first, I was worried that the thin plastic around the volume / power button might crack, but I've been using it for a month and it is as sturdy as the day I put it on the phone. There is also supposed to be a special coating that repels dirt and fingerprints, and I've been setting my phone down on multiple surfaces and it looks brand-new. If you see smudges / fingerprints on the aluminum panel, simply wipe down with a soft cloth and you're good to go.<br /><br />The one design feature I'm not crazy about is the fact that the top is left open; the bottom gives plenty of access to the speaker, headphone jack and adapter, and clearly Elago knew the power button had shifted from the top to the right, so I'm a bit confused why the top edge was left completely unprotected, as it seems likely that this is the surface that will hit first when dropped. The case does have a slight lip on the front, so you can set your phone face-down without worries about scratching the screen, but having the top edge enclosed would have made this a great case (so far the phone hasn't gotten scratched on the exposed edge, but I've been pretty careful with it).<br /><br />Things I like:<br />+ The case is made in Korea, not China.<br />+ Elago wrote a follow-up e-mail to ask how I liked my purchase.<br />+ Elago included several free gifts (a screen protector, cleaning cloth, and a car charger adapter) and a thank you note!<br />+ Smooth finishing (edges, corners, inside) means less chance of scratching your phone<br /><br />Things I'd improve:<br />- Enclose the top edge; since there are no buttons / jacks on top anymore, I can't see a reason for leaving the top edge of your phone / screen exposed to drops / cracks / scratches.<br /><br />Otherwise this is an excellent case and I would definitely recommend it!",1414241770000,1,True
5.0,"�Bend It Like Beckham� a riot of laughs, drama and football.","A friend in London (England, not Ontario) convinced me that I had to see ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" (along with praise from Sundance and the Toronto Film Festival) so lo and behold, one dreary spring day I stepped into a surprisingly crowded theatre (I wasn't sure of a British comedy's marketability in North America). ""BILB"" proved every bit as wonderful as my friend said, and in a nutshell is a sort of cross between ""Monsoon Wedding"" and ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding.""<br />Jess, a Londoner of Asian descent, plays football in secret since her parents strictly forbid it and want her to grow into a nice, traditional Sikh girl who can cook a full Punjabi dinner. Jess, however, has other plans. She teams up with Jules (short for Juliet), a fellow footballer, and the team coach Joe and an American scout eagerly appraises the two. Along the way Jess has to survive her sister's frantic, bipolar engagement and wedding, come clean to her parents about her joining the team, fights over her blossoming romance, and learns to follow her heart. Jess confides her worries to her David Beckham poster that hangs over her bed. Her room is filled with Beckham memorabilia. Jules' mother is similarly against her daughter playing football, convinced that she must be a lesbian since she favours sports bras, has short hair and wears boyish clothes. The two girls hang out often, finding more similarities than differences, but when Jess nearly kisses Joe, Jules is furious, having eyed him for herself, and a stony rivalry ensues.<br />The film is doused with Indian culture, including saris, salwar kameez, samosas, Bollywood musicals, singing game shows, bhangra rock, and more, but always finds a more or less comfortable balance between Indian and London cultures. The unbelievably colourful, extravagant wedding was one of my favourite highlights of the film since I adore bhangra rock and Bollywood. The soundtrack is similarly influenced, with many Indian pop songs, and my favourite of all, ""The Power of Love"" cover (Sitam version) by Amar. The cinematography is at times used for comedic effect, as in rapid cutaways to see the dazed/shocked/delighted expression of parents and relatives, in dizzying, rapid-fire football matches, the colourful exuberance of the Indian wedding, the sizzling energy of a German nightclub, and at times timed shots to capture the beauty of day turning into dusk.<br />The movie is blessed with a strong cast, a great story, and characters that draw you into their worlds, worries, and triumphs, not to mention a catchy soundtrack, great football action, and a tender romance. ""Bend It Like Beckham"" will certainly join my other honoured favourites such as ""Monsoon Wedding"" and ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding."" Oh, and look for a ""There's Something About Mary""-like singalong/bloopers during the credits. If you love football, romantic comedies, and/or Indian culture, you will surely score with ""Bend It Like Beckham.""",1052791833000,4,False

3.0,Not Very Durable,"I bought this as a replacement for a different  one that I gave to a friend. I’ve only been using it for a few weeks. The ring part, that you put your finger through, is only held on by a small pin, which after a lot of twisting and turning to reposition it for different angles, snapped right off. It’s nice to be able to reposition the ring but it needs to be made a lot more durable like my original one. Plus, the magnet is not as strong as the other one I had, which I will be re-ordering now that this one is broken.",1678146445088,0,True
3.0,Comfortable and thin,"These are not too bad, but they are not very strong as far as longevity. Within a couple of weeks some of the strands broke, but it was likely from twisting my finger around, trying to find a comfortable position. They are not too bad for holding the phone in the portrait mode but if you try to do it in landscape mode, it doesn’t work too well, at least for me. You do get two in a package so for the price, that part is not too bad, but they just won’t last long enough, especially if you have large fingers.",1663698062390,0,True
3.0,Protects well,"This is my second case from this manufacturer. With the first one, after about two months, the ring broke off because the only thing holding it on there is flimsy plastic.. The metal ring was very tight and hard to turn and eventually it just gave up and broke. The second one I ordered, which I am using now, the ring is very loose so it is useless to prop your phone up. The phone just falls flat when you try to use the ring.  The fact that it’s a square and not round makes it a little harder to get it in a comfortable position to hold it with your finger. I will definitely be looking for a case with a sturdier ring. That won’t be easy because on most cases with a ring they are very poorly constructed.",1658371438702,0,True
4.0,Sturdy Case,"The case seems pretty durable. Overall I like the style of the case and how it protects the edges and corners of the iPhone. I am just now submitting this review after having the case for 18 days. The ring broke off. You can rotate this ring but the mechanism is really stiff and there is only a small piece of plastic holding the ring to the side of the mechanism. It is definitely not adequate and if you rotate it a lot, it will break eventually which mine just did. I have had a few cases that had these rings on them and I have yet to find one that will last more than a few months.",1655313409389,3,True

It will not fit inside a purse but it is easily carried in a backpack or larger carry bag.<br /><br />As a tripod it is infinitely more stable than others smaller ones out there. It has multiple adjustments for the legs.<br /><br />The remote is very simple and has two buttons. One for iOS and one for android. It pairs easily when your Bluetooth is on.<br /><br />The only drawback with the remote is that there is no place on the tripod to store it, so you’ll either have to put it on a key ring, or carry it in your pocket.",1642880273617,0,True

3.0,Durable and Functional,"The case seems very durable and the kickstand is functional.

After 45 minutes my phone had gone up to 68%. I'm used to faster charging. It wasn't terrible and I can definitely live with it. I used it a couple of more times for shorter periods of time on that same day. By the end of the day, the charger was down to 60% which seems like less than other chargers I've used.

That is so much easier than trying to find that little port to plug the cable into. The buttons are a good size. He doesn't text, so that doesn't matter to us. I like that the volume is easy to adjust and it's designed for hard of hearing people. He has successfully made phone calls on this, so that's good.

It doesn't interfere with my magnetic phone holder in my car. The back of it is opaque so you can't see the magnet either. I haven't had any issues with the case interfering with the buttons.

The cable that it comes with works fine on my Chromebook without using any of the adapters. It comes partially charged, so I did fully charge it before using. I used it to charge my laptop, but I didn't watch the time very carefully to see how fast it charged. I was away from it for an hour and a half and the laptop was fully charged then.

They are one piece, but they are adjustable. The first time I put one on my Fitbit, I had the metal adjuster piece facing away from me. I quickly decided that I didn't like that look. Because I have a larger wrist, that piece caused an outer bump which didn't look great. I removed the band and put it on the other way and that was much better. I have it so it's loose enough that it moves when I shake my wrist, but it doesn't move otherwise. I like the variety of patterns and colors. It snaps into place easily.

There are also 2 goosenecks that can hold your phone, GoPro, or DSLR camera. He's currently not needing those, so they are hidden behind the monitor. There's a controller that sits on his desk that is connected to the unit. It's easy to use and controls the light settings. Overall, everything works well.

I like the small G on the back. The case is easy to put on and take off. My last phone case (for my old phone) was an Otterbox and that was not easy to put on and take off. The case doesn't interfere with the buttons. It's not slippery, however, I have dropped my phone more than I have ever dropped my previous ones. I have not figured out why though. And as a result of that, my screen protector has several small cracks on it. Thank goodness for the screen protector! The case doesn't extend above the edge of the surface of the screen which could be the problem. I have even taken the protector off just to make sure that cracks were on the protector and not the screen. Overall, I love the appearance of the case, but I just like the performance of it.",1600893432276,0,False
4.0,Protects Well,"My daughter recently bought herself an Apple Watch. I strongly advised her to get a screen protector for it. This was very difficult to remove the protective film. The edge was in the interior corner where she couldn't reach. She ended up using tweezers to grasp and remove it. It fits well, though it gives her watch a purplish cast to it that she doesn't care for. It seems to interfere with the sound quality, but it doesn't interfere with any of the touch screen controls. While it's protecting her watch well, she's thinking about looking for something else.",1600367372018,0,False
4.0,Easy to Use,"My daughter recently got her first car. I really wanted her to have a car with Bluetooth, but that didn't happen. This unit allows her to have Bluetooth. It's easy to use. We followed the instructions and it worked the first time. The sound quality is okay, not great. It's not bad for phone calls, but for music , it's no where close to the car's original stereo/speaker.  When using it while it's charging, you do have to deal with the cable. It does reach from the cigarette lighter to the driver's visor, but barely. Luckily, once it's charged, you can unplug the cable and put it away. My husband felt that it's really not any different than driving with a portable Bluetooth speaker. Overall, it does work and it's pretty good for making phone calls. I don't want my daughter using her phone while driving, so this is a decent alternative.",1598133127217,0,False
4.0,Good Screen Protection,My daughter just bought herself a new phone. This screen protector set comes with 3 screen protectors.

4.0,Interesting Design,"I wasn't sure what the point of this was when I first saw it, but after using it for a few days, I am loving how neat and tidy it is. It's compact and doesn't take up a lot of space. It can easily slip into your pocket or purse. When I first started playing around with it, I pulled the cables unevenly which then caused them not to go back in smoothly. I looked at the product description online and found that you have to pull them out together at the same time. When you do that, they do go back in to the case smoothly. The floral image seems to be on there pretty well. I've rubbed over it multiple times to see if it would wear off, but it hasn't so far. The charging cable works as it should and seems to be comparable in speed to others. I really need to see if I can find one that works for iPhones so I can get one for my daughter. This would make a fun stocking stuffer.",1568205788336,0,False

I have a thick Otterbox case on my phone and have found that the case is too thick for the magnets to work. The holder in my husband's car hasn't been working as well, so he was in need of replacing his. His was a couple of years old, and we have found that over time, the part that goes into the vent stretches or something and then it tends to come out too easily which is annoying. This one fits tightly in the vent and stays in place well which is what he needed. The magnets work well as they should. Overall, my husband is pleased with this.",1565786072115,0,False

It was at 62% when I first started charging it. It was at 89% within less than 15 minutes. That's a bit faster than how fast it charges with the original cable that it came with. The charger didn't get warm or hot while charging. The cable is a good length. Overall, I find this to be an impressive charger.",1565119294000,0,False
5.0,Strong!,"My husband and I use this kind of phone holder in our cars. The one in his car, though, has lost some of it's magnetic strength and the phones often fall off during driving. First of all, this style of phone holder is much easier to use because you can put your phone on it with just one hand. It's also easy to install and just inserts into the air vent. The magnetic strength on this is strong and holds our phones well. It also comes with a couple of metal plates in case you didn't have any. Overall, we're very pleased!",1553210328389,0,False

From the beginning, she had issues with the case interfering with some of the button controls. But then after just a couple of weeks, she dropped it and the case broke. The phone was fine, but the case didn't last. When you pay a lot of money for a name brand phone case, you expect it to last a while. This phone case is almost identical in thickness and material. It does NOT interfere with the button controls and it's priced significantly lower. She is very happy!",1552256798483,2,False

3.0,Fun Looking Case,"My teenage daughter has an iPhone 7. This clear case fits her phone very well. She likes the red color on the sides. The case offers good protection to her phone.

4.0,Can Charge Multiple Items at Once,"This is probably one of the largest power banks that I have seen. It's more than double the size of my other power banks. With that being said, it can also charge a lot more before needing to be recharged itself. Because of its size, it does weigh more and doesn't have the convenience of a slimmer power bank. For example, you can't really slip this into your pocket while charging your phone. There are lights on it to tell you how much battery power remains. It works with lightning cables which is unique. I have several smaller power banks and they all work with micro USB cords, so my daughter was delighted to learn that she didn't have to carry another cable with her just to charge her iPhone. It lasts longer than the smaller ones before it needs to be recharged, though it does take a while to fully charge it. Overall, it's a good, solid piece and does the job!",1541590518735,1,False
5.0,Great LED Power Level Display,"My power banks tend to disappear. Usually I find them in the kid's rooms where they have been used and have no more power when I need them. I usually try to keep a couple of them powered and ready to go to have on hand. Then, when we're out and about, I can come to the rescue. This power bank is thin enough that it can fit in your pocket if necessary. I love the LED power level display so there's no guessing as to how much power is left. It charges at a good rate, too!",1541032100824,0,False

4.0,Works With My Magnetic Phone Holder in the Car,"I just recently got a new phone and was so excited to find out that there were OtterBox cases for it. My last several phones have never been popular enough to have brand name cases available for them. I tried the Defender first. I really liked the case and the level of protection that it offered, but it was too thick that it didn't work with the magnetic phone holder that I use in the car. This Symmetry case does work with it. It also works with wireless charging where the Defender case did not. It's thinner and easier to put on your phone and take it off. I feel that there's adequate protection, but definitely not as tough as the Defender. The color is cute, but with the logo grooves, I'm already seeing dirt in some of the letters. A darker phone case would hide that better. The case does not interfere with the controls. The edge around the screen is raised. Overall, it's a good phone case. For my personal use, the level of protection is adequate.",1532697569619,0,False
4.0,"Definitely Offers Great Phone Protection, but......","I have been wanting a real OtterBox phone case for years. I have been jealous of all my friends who have them, but I always get the cheap Android phones that never have OtterBox compatible cases. I've ordered some for my daughter who has an iPhone. Even my husband had one with a previous phone, but not me. Well, I just got a new phone (okay, a last year's model) this summer and guess what! There are OtterBox cases that are designed for it. I can't tell you how excited I was! After a few days of carefully holding my phone because it didn't have a case on it, my OtterBox arrived. I  opened the box and immediately started pulling off the plastic screen protector that was attached to the case. It was in there good and tight, but I eventually tore it away. Well, guess what? You're not supposed to remove that! I did read some other reviews and a message board and learned that some people do remove it, so I don't feel like a total loser, but still......  I ordered a screen protector separately, so it was still protected. Now back to the case. It was a little difficult to get it on the phone, but once I did, I don't think it's ever going to come off, at least until I want it to come off. It's a great looking case and I feel that it offers superb protection. There are just a few things I'm not crazy about. One,  I use a magnetic air vent phone holder for my car. The magnet slips in between the phone and the case. This case is too thick for the magnetic waves to hold it on the holder. I'm really disappointed about that. I could put a magnet on the outside of the phone case, but then the case won't look as good. Another thing that I am not fond of is that the audio output and the charging port both have covers on them. I understand the need to keep dust and such out, but it is annoying. I accidently didn't put my charging cable in all the way last night so my phone wasn't charged this morning. That cover piece had gotten in the way. Other than that, I'm happy with it. The case doesn't interfere with the volume controls. It is easy to grip. There is also an OtterBox Symmetry case available for my phone, so I may try that out to see if it takes care of my issues.",1531933518099,0,False
5.0,Great OtterBox Case,"My teen daughter has been wanting a more girly phone case, but since she has broken her screen a couple of times in the past, she has become very picky about the brand and quality of phone cases that she uses.

4.0,Great Alternative to Wallet Style Cases,"I recently learned that iPhone sizes were pretty standard, at least for 6,7, & 8 models. So I ordered this for my daughter to use with her iPhone 6. It fits perfectly! This is a unique case that allows some storage which is great for people who can't carry a wallet or purse with them. My daughter loves using this to go to the movies or places with her friends. She can slip her debit card or cash in the back and she's good to go. She does not like the wallet style phone cases, so this is a good alternative. There is a piece underneath the straps that can be removed. It's a little difficult to put back in place, but not impossible. The bands stretch so they can accommodate slight thickness such as keys. The Under Armour logo is pretty discreet. It offers adequate phone protection.",1512561423445,1,False

But after having to shell out money to repair her screen at least two times, she has started using cases known for their protective abilities. This Under Armour case is comparable to the Otterbox, Lifeproof, and Speck cases that she has used. It fits her iPhone perfectly. The case offers excellent protection and doesn't interfere with the buttons or controls. The case is white, so she is anticipating that it will become dingy after a while, but so far it's staying clean. She has gotten many compliments on the case since she's started using it.",1509751329523,1,False

4.0,Great Idea!,"I think the Xscape charger is a great idea! I have an emergency car escape tool, but it is located in the console between the front seats. I know where it is and it's within my reach, but the location of this is even more convenient. As a charger, I am very pleased. First of all, it has a blue light so you know that it's charging. I have had some car chargers that don't have any light, so if they wiggle out a bit to the point of not charging any more, I didn't know it. With this one, if the blue light is not on, then it's not charging. The speed of the charging is pretty good, too. It's definitely comparable to other car chargers regarding the speed. My husband and I did try the seat belt cutter on some cardboard and fabric scraps. It didn't cut in a smooth line, but it did saw through our materials eventually. The hammer feature was tested out on a block of wood. It left some dents in the wood. You would definitely have to be careful when working with glass because the size of it keeps your hand in a fairly close proximity to the surface you are trying to break. Hopefully, we'll never need to use this for anything other than charging!",1505817097316,2,False
5.0,Pleased With It,"I ordered a set of these to use with my WizGear magnetic car mount. I didn't realize that some were included with my mount.

5.0,Works Great!,"I've been using an air vent phone mount for the past year or so. I always had some kind of difficulties putting my phone into it. About half the time, it would take more than one attempt to get it in the mount. So I got in habit of only putting it there for road trips when I was using my phone as a GPS. This magnetic device is so much easier to use! I put my phone on it just about every time I am in the car. Since it's in the vent and I am currently running my AC all the time, my phone is always nice and chilled when I remove it. I figure that's much better than it being warm as it can be on occasion. The mount was easy to install. This comes with two, so I gave one to my husband for his car, too. It also comes with 4 adhesive metal plates, too. I didn't realize that, so I had purchased a set separately. I just inserted one of the plates inside my phone case. My husband's phone case is thicker, so he used the adhesive strip and stuck it to the back of his phone case. I've ordered another mount for my teenage son, too.",1500124265462,7,True

The only thing I don't like is that it doesn't light up to show that it's charging. I thought the description indicated that it would do that, but mine does not.

5.0,Lots of Protection,"My teenage daughter owns an iPhone 6. We've had to replace the screen twice so far. We've told her that she is paying to replace it next time.  She had heard about LifeProof cases and has asked us for one, but they are a bit pricey. However, we are discovering that it's well worth it. Each time we've replaced her screen, it's cost about $75. The case fits snugly on her phone, but still allows her to fully use it. One of the controls on the left side is a little harder to use, but the instructions said that would happen. Before putting it on her phone, she did fold a piece of paper towel and inserted inside the case. Then she submerged it in water for a few minutes. The paper towel was dry when she took it out and there were no water drops inside. The instructions say to do a thirty minute water test, but she has not done that yet. She doesn't plan to actually use her phone in the water, but it's good to know that rain and sweat won't be a problem. Once the case is on the phone, it's not really easy to remove it. It does come with a small tool to help open it up if you need to access the phone. It comes with a wide angle lens which she has been having fun with and is a nice bonus feature. The case is primarily black, with a small amount of lime green showing on the sides. She loves her new phone case and feel good about it keeping her phone safe.",1497970839678,0,False

4.0,Holds Phone Securely,"I come from a family of tech nerds. My husband got his first cardboard VR kit at a trade show a couple of years ago. In the last year we have gotten a few cardboard ones and a couple of plastic ones. This Bestrix one is very nice looking and very comfortable. It can accommodate my larger Samsung Galaxy J7 phone, although I do have to remove the case from it first. My phone will not fit in some of the cardboard versions. Phones are securely held in the headset. Some of the earlier ones that I have tried did not make me feel that my phone was 100% safe!  This works for simple VR apps. It does not have any kind of trigger mechanism so you can control your phone once it is in the headset. So if you're playing a game or visiting a VR world, you can not access the menu that shows up on your screen. I've used some VR world apps where that's not necessary, but there are a lot of them that do utilize a menu. It comes with some foam sticky buttons that you are supposed to put on the pull out try where your phone goes and line them up with the phone's buttons, but even with that, there's still no way to trigger the menu.

The cut out holes are adequate and don't interfere with charging. The side power button is completely covered by the phone, but it is very easy to operate without any problems. The volume button on the other side is also completely covered, but it is a little difficult to use. It doesn't always work the first time. I've always been able to use it, but it sometimes takes a couple of tries. The bottom of the case has little grippy bumps so the phone doesn't slip out of your hands too easily.

My daughter likes the tempered glass protectors, so I thought I would go with that. This came with everything needed to ready my phone. The glass screen protector was very easy to put on my phone.

5.0,Great Protection for My J7!,"I had to get a new phone over the weekend and needed a phone case for it. I've had mixed experiences with hybrid phone cases before, so I wasn't sure what I would get with this one. The issue that I had in the past was that if you had to take the cover off, it was a 2-step process. You had to take off the hard case then the soft case or the other way around, I don't remember. Then when putting it back on, I could never get them perfectly back in place. I finally stopped trying and got a new one piece phone case. Well this case is basically one piece, so it's super easy to put on and take off. The edges around the screen are raised so extra protection is given to your phone. I have noticed that the button on the right side of the phone is a little more difficult to use since this case doesn't have a cut out there. Other than that, all of the other openings/buttons work just fine. I am beyond thrilled with this phone case!!!

She was practically in tears when I gave her this case. It fit her phone perfectly. She loved the magnetic feature which allowed her to easily remove her phone from the wallet. It’s made from PU leather, but it looks classy and like real leather. I have purchased some PU leather items that look more like vinyl, but this looks good. And I felt good giving it to her whereas if it had looked cheap, I probably wouldn’t have given it to her at all. The zipper on the wallet portion zipped okay. It wasn’t a super smooth gliding zipper. The case doesn’t interfere with the performance of the phone buttons or controls.

There is a flexible plastic/rubber case that fits directly on your phone. Then that case has magnets in it that keep it attached to the faux leather folder/wristlet. There is a magnetic clasp that keeps the folder closed. There are 2 card slots as well as a pocket to slide bills into. That's plenty of room for a teen. You wouldn't want to put much more in there due to thickness. The whole thing would not stay closed as well.  The magnets on the back of the separate phone case are pretty strong. She was able to stick her phone on the refrigerator and it did not slip or fall. There are not a lot of reasons that you would want to put your phone there, but if you do, then know that it's strong enough to hold it there. This wallet style phone case is perfect for my daughter to use. She doesn't usually carry a purse with her, but she always takes her phone with her. Now she can store her student ID and a little bit of cash with her easily. The case does not interfere with charging or headphone ports.<br /><br />*I received this case for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. My thoughts & opinions are my own.",1457305881000,1,False
4.0,Light Weight,"This is a nice, light weight reflective vest. I am a plus size woman (size 18) and I ordered the L/XL size. It fit fine, but I didn't like the way it fit me. I am large chested and the cut of this vest looked really awkward on me. It really emphasized my chest more than I would have liked. However, the size did fit my husband (6'2&#34; and 220 pounds) okay. The material is really light weight so you don't feel bogged down with a lot of extra fabric. And if it's hot outside, you won't get overheated. There is a hidden zipper pocket on the inside front if you need to keep anything secured. The vest is adjustable around the waist with velcro closures. The reflective bands are a nice bonus. It comes with a small drawstring bag for storage.<br /><br />*I received this for free for the purpose of trying it out & reviewing. My thoughts & opinions are my own.",1455145155000,0,False
5.0,Beautiful Phone Case,"This is a classy, good looking phone case. The case fits my daughter's  iPhone 6 nicely. It's a fairly firm plastic material, but it doesn't seem like it will snap into pieces or break easily. It does not interfere with any of the phone controls. My daughter has dropped her phone with this case on and her phone was completely protected. She really likes the grippy texture on the back of the case.<br /><br />*I received this phone case for free for the purpose of trying it out & reviewing.

4.0,Good Screen Protector,"This is a good, iPhone 6 screen protector. My daughter especially likes that it has the black trim around it that mimics her actual phone screen. My daughter received her iPhone for Christmas and has cracked 3 different screen protectors. They all prevented her phone screen from cracking, so we have been very happy. This is our first one from i-Kawachi and so far, so good. It's a little thinner than some of the other ones she's tried.<br /><br />* I received this screen for free for the purpose of trying it out & reviewing.

4.0,Cute,"This phone case is so cute! I love the grey and turquoise combination. I ordered this for my daughter who got an iPhone 6 for Christmas. She loves swapping out phone cases regularly. The colors in this one match her room. It's a hybrid case, so it's in 2 pieces. The silicone piece is pretty thin. After opening the package, my daughter's first reaction was that it wasn't going to offer much protection for her phone. Then when the other piece went in place, she decided it was going to be adequate. It took her a while to get it all &quot;perfectly&quot; in place. It doesn't interfere with her buttons and controls.<br /><br />*I received this case for free for the purpose of trying it out &amp; reviewing.

5.0,So Much Fun!!,"I work in a Special Ed middle school class. I took this Google Cardboard into class last week and those students absolutely loved it. First of all, it was easy to put together. My husband has purchased other Cardboards and the earlier models required more work to assemble. This one was super easy and I was able to do it all by myself. I downloaded a couple of VR apps from Google Play and let the students take turns with it. My favorite moment is when one of the autistic boys had his turn. He chose the Ocean VR one. After a moment of looking through it, he started singing &quot;Part of My World&quot; from Disney's The Little Mermaid. Many of the students in my class come from low income families. And none of them had ever used one of these before, let alone seen one. They were completely enthralled with it. After allowing all of the kids to take a turn, one of the velcro pieces was starting to come up, but that's an easy fix as far as I am concerned. And other than that, it held up very well. It's definitely a high quality, cardboard.  Another fun moment was when I shared it with the other classroom aid who is almost 60. She just as excited about it as the kids were! It is pretty amazing how far technology has progressed.<br /><br />*I received this for free for the purpose of trying it out &amp; reviewing.

4.0,Pretty phone case,"This is a cute phone case. It's very thin and I am not sure how safe my daughter's phone is, but she rotates phone cases practically every day, so it will be okay. My daughter really likes the design. For the price it's a deal.<br /><br />*So apparently I purchased two different phone cases here for my daughter. She picked them both out. They're both cute, but thin.  So far they've done a good job of protecting her phone. She also uses a screen protector too.",1453683479000,2,True
5.0,Great Screen Protection!,"My daughter has owned her iPhone for not quite a month. We made her put a screen protector on it immediately and we're glad we did. She's dropped her phone a couple of times and twice she has cracked her screen protector, but both times her phone screen was unharmed. So needless to say, we will be making sure her phone always has a protector on it.  She just replaced her latest cracked protector with one of these Sooyo ones. She's getting quite good at applying screen protectors. There were no issues with air bubbles. It covers her screen well. It does not interfere with her touch response.<br /><br />*I received these screen protectors for free for the purpose of trying out and reviewing.

5.0,Great for FOB Fans!!,"My 14 year old daughter got an iPhone 6 for Christmas and has been ordering a bunch of different phone cases. She loves Fallout Boy & was super excited to find a phone case decorated in FOB  songs & phrases. First of all, it arrived much earlier than expected. The tracking on my Amazon page still says it's on the way, but it has already arrived. The case is flexible and easy to put on the phone. There are FOB lyrics written all over the case. There is the phrase F*** You on it which is barely visible in the picture. (It's located to the upper right of the crown on the logo.) The print is not crystal clear, but it's definitely legible. So far it's offered nice protection to her phone. My daughter absolutely loves her Fallout Boy phone case!!!",1452994156000,2,True
5.0,Longest Cables I Own!,"These are excellent Micro USB cables. The braided cables are cute & stylish, but also strong & sturdy. The connectors are not loose nor do they wiggle.

5.0,Great Phone Case!,"My daughter received an iPhone for Christmas. She's been picking out cute, fun cases for it, but I wanted her to get a more protective one. This one is just a bumper that covers the phone sides. It extends slightly giving the phone protection from falls. It's simple and streamlined and just looks good. It also comes with a front and back screen protector, too. She is not using the back protector, just the one for the screen. The case does not interfere with buttons and controls. So far, it's done a great job of protecting her phone!<br /><br />*I received this for free for the purpose of trying out & reviewing. My thoughts & opinions are my own.",1451859486000,0,False
5.0,Easy to Use!,"My daughter received an iPhone for Christmas and she immediately wanted to put a screen protector on it. A lot of her friends have iPhones and many of them have cracked screens. I did a little research and the tempered glass ones stood out. This was easy to install, though since we live in a pet friendly home, my daughter was a little frustrated with the pet hair that kept getting in the way. There were no bubbles and it fits the phone well. She has not had any issues with interference when touching or viewing her screen. She also has a phone case with a small edge as addition protection. She is very happy with her screen protector!<br /><br />*Update! My daughter dropped her phone on the driveway. The screen protector cracked, but her phone screen was just fine. She is so thankful that she had this protecting her phone!!<br /><br />*I received this for free for the purpose of trying out & reviewing. My thoughts & opinions are my own.",1451488778000,0,False
4.0,Great Waterproof Case!,"[[VIDEOID:10a420569d24b6683b1c5a4e76fe4dff]] This is a great, waterproof phone case! We tested it out by putting a folded paper towel inside, then holding it under the kitchen faucet for several moments. The paper towel was completely dry when we took it back out. My daughter's iPhone 6 as well as my Nexus 5 phone fits well in it. You can use the phone while it is in the case, but it's not as easy as when it's out. I found that it didn't always react to my swipes from inside the case. The case is made out of a thick vinyl material. It comes with a strap so you can wear it around your neck. The only reason that I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I found it difficult to open. My daughter was able to open it easily, but I had a lot of troubles with it. Besides that, this is an excellent waterproof case!<br /><br />*I received this for free for the purpose of trying out &amp; reviewing. My thoughts &amp; opinions are my own.",1451162552000,0,False

This is a great set of 5 pastel cases. They flex on the sides to allow it to fit over the phone. The back is clear so she is playing around with making some print outs or pictures to insert inside. The case does not interfere with the ports or buttons. We don't know how well it will protect her phone in the long run and we will update our review if it doesn't meet our expectations. But for now, we feel it's definitely better protected than without any case at all. And for the price, it's a great deal!",1451096268000,20,True
5.0,Great Close Ups!,"I was a bit skeptical about needing a fisheye lens, but it really is pretty cool. It's quite impressive how well the close up pictures work using it. I tried a different fisheye lens about a year ago & this one is much better. One of the things I really like about this one is the way it attaches to the phone with the clip. It's similar to a basic alligator clip. My old one was really awkward to put on. Another simple feature that I like is the storage bag. The only thing that would improve that would be for a hard case to store it in so it doesn't get crushed or broken. The lens is easy to use and it worked well on my Nexus 5.<br /><br />*I received this for the purpose of trying out & reviewing. My thoughts & opinions are my own.",1448924976000,0,False
5.0,Easier to Accommodate Nexus 5 Phone Over Standard Armband Cases.,"Finally a phone armband that accommodates larger phones!! My husband is a fairly new runner follows the C25K program. We have tried several different phone armbands, but it has always been a tight squeeze as far as fitting his phone into them. His phone isn't extremely large -he has a Nexus 5, but with it's case, he has a hard time getting it to fit inside. His phone fits much better in this one. There's about 1/2 an inch space at the top and less than 1/4 of an inch on the side when it's in the case. There's not so much extra space that it's sliding around. In fact it stays in place very well. With the smaller cases, he found that some of the buttons were obscured by the framing of the window. That's not the case with this one. He can access just about all of his phone controls. Needless to say, this has made him a happy husband!<br /><br />*I purchased this phone armband at a reduced price for the purpose of trying it out & reviewing.

5.0,Sleek Design,"Not only is this a useful phone stand, it's good looking, too. The aluminum material is sturdy & gives it a contemporary feel. My Nexus 5 fits well in it and it keeps it at the perfect angle for easy viewing.

5.0,Great Micro USB Cables!,"My family uses a lot of Micro USB Cables. We all have Android phones and tablets. We have a couple of charging stations around the house and chargers in each car. Every so often I have to replace some cables because they start to fray or come apart at the connector or they just start failing. When we don't have enough cables in the house, my teenagers do not hesitate to unplug my phone or tablet so they can charge theirs! So when I was approached by Boxeroo to try these out, I was very excited to do so! Each cable is over 6 feet long so they can easily reach under and around furniture. The braided cables are flexible and sturdy. I love the variety of colors! They connect snuggly without any wiggling.

5.0,Easy to Find & Charges Quickly!,"My husband & I have 2 teenagers. So between the 4 of us, we have 4 Android phones, 4 tablets, & 4 laptops. We go through a lot of micro USB cables. Over the years, I have learned that not all USB cables are created equally! First of all, the plastic the covers the ends of the cables is a solid material. We have had several cables that with use, bend or break in the place where the actual cable meets. Since this is all one piece on the ends, that's not going to happen. The cable is a good length. It's long enough that if it's plugged in a lower outlet, it can still reach the end table, but it's not too long that you have a lot of excess cable getting in the way. I love that it's available in a few different colors. I selected the lime green one so it's very easy to see which cable is mine! And if anyone walks away with it, I know which child has it! At first I had this in my car with a car charger. But over the last week, I never was in my car for more than 10 minutes at a time, so I couldn't get an accurate feel for whether or not it was a fast syncing cable. This morning I brought it inside and plugged into one of our charging stations. My phone was at 50% so I was curious to learn how quickly it would charge using this cable. Within 10 minutes my phone had charged  an additional 10%. When I checked thirty minutes later, it was fully charged. I was quite pleased with that. I have a Nexus 5 phone and depending on where I am charging it, it often takes longer than that.<br /><br />*I received the Haweel Micro USB cable for the purpose of trying it out & reviewing it.

The biggest difference between this one and the other mounts I have is the grip clip. I think that is so much easier to use. Both types require 2 hands, but in my opinion, the clip is more user friendly. We have 4 different Andriod phones in our household and they all fit well in the mount. So far we have not had any problems with it staying in place. I am very happy with my purchase.",1418072708000,0,False

Every time we go out together, she gives me her cell phone to hold. Her phone/case are too bulky to fit comfortably in her pockets and she doesn't feel the need to carry a purse if I'm with her. Plus, many of her clothing items don't have pockets. Her phone fits nicely and securely in this. The bag itself is a nice, shiny silver faux patent material. The inside is bright, pink fabric. The chain is so much sturdier than I thought it would be and is comfortable worn across your body. The top of the bag does not close, but as long as you are wearing the bag, that's not an issue.

5.0,Happy Teen Customer,"My 13 year old daughter selected this for her phone and she loves it! It's a little thicker than we thought it would be, but she is adapting to it. Because of the thickness, it doesn't fit as easily into her pockets as her previous phone cover. The case is a mix of a hard case & rubber. The kickstand seems sturdy enough. It's going to be difficult to keep the white portion of the case white. We've already noticed a few scuffs, however, so far she's been able to wipe them off. It took 10 days from ordering for it to arrive, which is forever for a young teen!**UPDATE** I just changed my review from a 4 star to a 5 star. After a couple of months, I am very impressed with how it is doing. It still looks brand new. All the little jewels are still in tact, the kickstand is still secure and the white portion still is clean.

With all my other Iphone cases I have used Otterbox and have never had an issue, however the Otterbox Commuter (for the 6) had horrible reviews so I went with the Incipio. The Stealth Armor Touch Case is NOT as tough as the Incipio. The Incipio DualPro case is now selling for only $15.99, where as this one is selling for $17.95. Also the Incipio feels much more smooth in the hand, the changeable backs for the Stealth case feel awkward and cheap.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Comes with screen protector.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Awkward feel because of snap on changeable back plates.<br />Dose not have the protection that a product named Armor Tough should have.",1417214454000,4,False

It takes a bit of playing around with to figure out. The touch screen can be unresponsive at times which is frustrating. I really like the free app Music+ that is available for this phone.

I note that the upper and lower edge slope upward, creating more distance between the phone and any surface.<br />Not one of my cases protects the sides of the phone - it is simply a matter of the way S10s are made. DON'T  expect any case to cover those sides.<br />3. There are two covers at the bottom of the case for the USB cord and headphones. When you put the case on, OPEN those covers first and the phone will pop right into the case.

We were able to port our phone numbers from our old carrier -- just be sure AT&T has your correct information from your former carrier account. We did have a glitch, but AT&T quickly fixed things. AT&T also solved other problems in a way that was very beneficial to us. I cannot speak too highly of both their tech support and billing employees. They have been superb!<br /><br />Bear in mind that if you are used to smaller flip phones, for example, the size of this baby takes a little getting used to; however, this slight impracticality is outweighed by all of the things this phone can do.<br /><br />There are apps for everything under the sun, and many, many are free. We are using GasBuddy, WeatherBug, FastFood Nutrition, and Lotto, to name a few.<br /><br />Our data package with AT&T gives each of us 3Gig of data per month. We are averaging under 10Meg a day, so we are well on course. When we use a WiFi network, we get unlimited data use and no usage charge against the 3Gig allotment. We may be able to cut back to a 300Meg plan and save on the monthly charges. (If any of this turns out differently over time, I will update this section of my review.)<br /><br />If you are looking to take the next step in hardware, I am confident that you will be very happy with this choice.

I've waited about half a year now and even my cell phone company is telling me to get rid of this phone. Calls drop and often I can't make calls because I am out of range, whatever that means - never happened with cheaper phones! The only way out of that is to turn it off and on again. I've had to contact my cell phone company three times now to reset the phone, which involves me removing the sim card, and turning it off while they do that from their end. When I asked how to avoid doing this, they said buy a new phone. How disappointing!!! I would not recommend this phone for that reason, for not making calls (see above), for not being loud enough for voicemails, for saying that my contacts to call do not exist when they do, for calls not going through -they dial and hang up. It's SO frustrating. I didn't get insurance, so, I am screwed and need to keep the phone, but it's sooo frustrating! Would not recommend.",1667526232504,1,True

The color is one of her favorite colors and she loves how sleek and thin the cases yet sturdy enough for her to trust that her phone is protected.<br /><br />I would suggest buying a quality screen protector since the size of the case are not very deep. This is the only drawback or negative that I have to say about the case. I am used to having an OtterBox case that has deeper edges so if the phone is dropped screen side down it’s less likely to impact the ground or scratch the screen. This is still a quality case at an amazing price. I recommend the seller and the product.,1652326071252,2,True

It’s thin but sturdy and has a stand on the back of it that you can lift out and swivel to be able to prop your phone up or put your finger through while you’re holding the phone. The only thing that I wish was different for the case was the depth of the edge. I’m used to having an OtterBox phone case in the edges are deeper in case the phone falls screen side down. However I just bought a better screen protector and I love the set up. Of course I’m not one that is super hard on my phone but at least I know if I drop it by accident I have a good chance of surviving the fall. I do recommend this case. Don’t let the price fool you.

However I am satisfied with what I got.<br /><br />The materials feel cheap and i can't speak towards the durability since I just started using it. But the buttons are very clicky and control sticks feel very smooth. They have little resistance though. The rear triggers are too soft, but I'm not going to use them much. I just wanted something to play old school games on emulators.<br /><br />The only real downside is that my controller came with one dead button (select) that doesn't work at all. Since the games I'm trying to play require way less buttons, it's a not a big deal (I can remap to an extra button), but that's still not good.<br /><br />Also this controller is on the small size. I have tiny hands so I actually like this, but for average or large hands, this might cause you to cramp up.<br /><br />One other detail, is that the buttons are labeled (a, b, x, y , etc) but the way a PC or phone reads that does not match. They're all reversed so it can be confusing if you have no way to remap buttons)<br /><br />Pros:<br />- clicky buttons (except for triggers)<br />- connected easily to phone and PC<br />- tiny controller (I have small hands)<br />- dpad feels responsive<br />- good price compared to rivals ($16)<br />- good size holder (even my friend's new note 9 fits!)<br /><br />Cons:<br />- came with dead button (select)<br />- button labels don't match mapping on devices<br />- tiny controller (if you have average or large hands)<br />- cheap feeling materials<br />- bad trigger button feel<br />- little resistance on control sticks<br /><br />Takings stars off for dead button.

5.0,Exactly what I wanted from a rubber case,"I know everyone has their own preference for the kinds of cases they like, and I generally like open-front, soft to medium-soft rubberized cases. So when I saw this, it was perfect.<br /><br />The case is rubbery, so it's not a hard case which doesn't protect all that much in a fall, but it's not super soft where the corners would get cracked if dropped. Each corner is slightly bulky, meaning that even if you drop the phone on the front or back, it will always hit the case first, unlike some thinner cases I've seen would are flush with the screen.<br /><br />I got mine in a cool semi-transparent gradient blue to purple, and the back of the cover is clear, really showing off the nice lilac color of my S9. It has all the appropriate holes for speakers, camera, headphones, fingerprint etc. It also doesn't interfere with my clear skin protector. The button spaces are all responsive, and it's a snug fit that won't come off easily.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy with what I got.

5.0,Really pet case for my iPhone,"The cut outs are perfect, size is perfect. I only have two small problems. 1. It's developed a small bubble. Not really a huge problem, but detracts from the overall beauty of the thing. I've had other similar cases for other phones and they've all done the same thing so I'm going on that being very normal. 2. I'm having some trouble keeping my pop socket on it. It appears to be a material the pop socket doesn't like to stick to. I'm thinking one of the adhesive discs that are meant to be used with a glass backed phone would likely solve that issue but I don't have one at the moment to test that theory. So overall I love the case. It's really pretty on my rose gold phone (I picked the rose gold glitter).<br /><br />Also, it looks really cool from the front with the torch lit. My other cases haven’t done this although they were for other phones...",1583810852920,0,True

I didn't notice when I ordered it (or when I came back to review it) that it came with a screen protector.  I put it away though because it would bubble.  If you saw her screen you'd known it would bubble.  No sense in even trying it.  Anyway, I'm getting off topic.  It looks really gorgeous on her phone.  I was surprised as well by the muticolored glitter.  We'd thought it was going to be all purple.  I'd also bought a popsocket with a blue purple and pink nebula on it (it was mine but she insisted, and, well, I admit she's kinda spoiled lol) and it's all matchy matchy.

I'm pretty confident in it's protective abilities as well.

My previous (non magnetic) cable was 6 feet and this one's 5. So it doesn't reach as far from the charger plug but it works and no more wear on my USB c port!

5.0,"Perfect, exactly what I needed","I have to admit I was a little worried seeing some of the reviews about the screen protector not being flush with the phone.  Then I got mine, and sure enough, it rippled across the middle and I was having a lot of trouble clicking things.  BUT I took it off and put it back on again, and apparently one of the clips wasn't completely clicked and it was holding part of one side up just a tiny bit, causing a gap and ripple effect across the middle of the screen.  I love the case, now.  :-)  Aside from the difficulty in putting it on (and avoiding the gap) it's perfect ... and the putting on difficulty is pretty limited.  I love the color, I love how it feels in my hand, and most of all, I love that my meddlesome cats can knock it off the nightstand while I sleep and I don't have to panic when I wake up - terrified to look at the screen.  (They've already broke two phones and a tablet! ... My mistake downloading &#34;games for cats,&#34; I guess.)  Now my son wants one for his G3 he'll be getting when he returns from boot camp, and I tearfully wish they made one for my GPad.<br /><br />Also, if you're having trouble getting to the edge of the screen, try taking it off and putting it back on.

For it to work, the FOB must be placed inside the zippered compartment (not just the gold-lined pocket).<br /><br />RFID blocking will block signals from credit cards that broadcast wireless signals, and signals from most cell phones. A functioning Faraday bag will also block signals from car key FOBs.  In my experience, Faraday bags stop working after a few months, so you must retest the FOB blocking regularly, if blocking your car’s key FOB signal is important to you.  (If the bag should stop working, wrap your car key FOB completely in a couple of layers of aluminum foil to block the signal.)<br /><br />This Faraday bag is big enough to hold a Samsung Galaxy S10 phone, with plenty of room to spare.

(Again, there’s nothing about car battery drainage in the instructions.)<br /><br />Even if the switches turn everything off that’s able to drain the battery, there’s no way that I won’t forget and leave one or more turned on some time when I turn off the car’s ignition.  For me to use a device like this, I need for the device to turn off automatically with the ignition.<br /><br />In the end, I don’t really need a bunch of extra accessory power sockets in my car.  My car has two sockets, and will also charge a cellphone that is plugged into a built-in USB charging port.  I don’t know what I was thinking when I ordered this device.",1592954617185,0,False
5.0,Galaxy S10 Phone Recognizes Charger as “Fast Charger”,"This CLUVOX 36W DUAL USB CAR CHARGER (Fast Charging 3.0 Car Adapter with 2-Pack 3.3ft Type C Cord) works as advertised.  My Samsung Galaxy S10 phone recognizes it as a “fast charger” when it is plugged into my Honda Accord’s accessory power socket, and it seems to charge the phone quite fast.<br /><br />Both cables work.  Both cables have USB Type C plugs--the reversible oval kind that are used by newer Galaxy phones.  The blue light around the rim of the charger tells you it is connected.  The light also makes it easier to see the ports on the plugged-in charger, if your car’s accessory power socket is in a dark space like the Accord’s pocket or console.<br /><br />Note that this is a “Cluvox” car charger, not a “name brand” car charger, so the quality may not be as good as you might get from a more expensive charger purchased from a cell phone manufacturer or seller (e.g., Samsung, Verizon).  I haven’t had my Cluvox charger for long enough to know whether it will continue to work well.",1592774927790,1,False
5.0,Fast Wireless Charger Performs Better Than Samsung Wireless Charger,"This ANKER WIRELESS CHARGER WITH POWER ADAPTER (PowerWave II Pad, Qi-Certified 15W Max Fast Wireless Charging Pad) definitely charges my Galaxy S10 cell phone faster than my original, official, Samsung Qi-charging pad.  All I have to do is center my Qi-enabled phone atop the Anker pad, and the charging begins.<br /><br />The Anker charging pad has a small blue light on the front that lights up when the pad is actively charging.  As long as you center your phone sideways on the Anker pad, you can easily see the light.  The charger is noiseless.  (Like all wireless chargers, this one charges more slowly than a phone cable connected directly to an AC outlet.)<br /><br />If you have a Galaxy S10 phone, you don’t even need a light on your wireless charging pad.  The phone’s display tells you everything you need to know about the charging status--whether the phone is charging, how much charge is currently in your phone, and how much time remains before the phone is fully charged.  When the phone is 100% charged, the display tells you that as well.<br /><br />Anker products have a good reputation for quality and reliability.  All of the Anker products that I’ve actually tried (mostly power banks and backup batteries) have lived up to that reputation.",1583703004841,1,False
5.0,Charges New iPad Very Fast (Needs Lightning to USB-C Cable),"This ESR USB-C 18W FAST WALL CHARGER WITH PD (UL Certified, with Foldable Prong) charges my new iPad Air (3rd Gen) very fast--much, much faster than the Apple 12W USB Charger that came with it.<br /><br />PD means “Power Delivery”.  USB PD is a new power standard that can be used across multiple devices, so that you don’t need a lot of different adapters.  PD increases power levels--up to 100W--so that devices charge faster.  PD determines how much power each device needs, and ensures that each device is NOT overcharged.  This ESR USB charger delivers 18W of power.<br /><br />PD chargers have USB-C ports, so you will need a cable with a USB-C plug (rather than the familiar flat USB plug) to connect your iPad, cellphone, etc.  My iPad uses a lightning cable, so I ordered this [[ASIN:B07CMN7DCX Apple Lightning to USB-C cable]].  It’s a genuine Apple cable that arrives new in a sealed Apple box, so I know it’s safe to use with the iPad.<br /><br />Until I got the settings on the new iPad adjusted to eliminate battery-draining default features, I was actually having to curtail my iPad use.  The iPad was discharging rapidly, and the recharging with the ordinary USB adapter was taking forever.  This 18W PD adapter solved the problem completely.  The iPad recharges quickly even when it’s connected to my home wireless network and I’m using it.",1577547796165,0,False
3.0,Nice Design But Doesn’t Fit 2019 Honda Accord,"I like the design of this LONCASTER CAR PHONE MOUNT (Silicone Car Phone Holder for Various Dashboards) a lot.  The pad has a sticky back that makes it removable, the pad grips your cell phone securely, and there’s a little rimmed tray in front for small items (e.g., a key fob?).<br /><br />Unfortunately, it has a footprint that is too large for my 2019 Honda Accord.  The Accord dashboard has NO level space on the driver’s side that is large enough accommodate this mount.",1574975687672,0,True
5.0,"Compact, Lightweight, Highly Portable Cell Phone Stands","These ELIMOONS CELL PHONE STANDS (4 Pack, Foldable, Multi-Angle, Black/White) work beautifully as cell phone stands.  They are compact, light as a feather, fold completely flat, and slip almost unnoticeably into a pocket or purse.  They have a good anti-slip surface in the rimmed area that holds the cell phone.<br /><br />The stands work for any cell phone.  My Galaxy S7 Edge with its Otterbox Symmetry case (a hard shell case that covers the back and sides of the phone) fits perfectly.<br /><br />You can use these stands to support iPads or other tablets.  However, tablets are heavy, so you must center them carefully on the little stands.  Tablets are easily dislodged--wider, sturdier stands work better for tablets.<br /><br />Whether the stands hold up if carried loose in a backpack or tote remains to be seen.  However, the stands don’t have to be particularly durable, because they’re bargain-priced (about $9 for a pack of 4 on Amazon).",1571410472340,12,False
5.0,"Exceptional, Full-Featured, Touchpad Stylus/Pen Combo","All tablet styluses are NOT alike!  What really sets apart this FRISHARE 4-in-1 UNIVERSAL CAPACITIVE STYLUS PEN (for Touch Screen Devices; with Ballpoint Pens, Disc, Fiber & Mesh Tips; Black) is that each tip has its own screw threading.  This means you can rearrange the stylus barrel to keep the tips you use most in the configuration most convenient for you.<br /><br />The stylus tips are sensitive; and the disc tip works beautifully for photo markups.  The medium-fine ballpoint pen is acceptable for most people, and the ink flows smoothly.<br /><br />Because stylus tips wear out, the pen comes with a set of replacement tips (rubber, mesh, and disc).  The replacements screw/slide in and out easily.  Also included is a ballpoint pen refill, and a faux leather protective case for the pen.",1567264965228,0,False
5.0,Mesmerizing Black-and-Blue Cable Lights Turn Off With Full Charge,"[[VIDEOID:de36dc61522c5532dc42424b410bacfc]] This BLAZING FUN TYPE C LIGHT-UP USB CHARGING CABLE (360 Degree Flowing LED Light, 3Ft) is delightful.  Mine has a black braided cable with a turquoise blue light spiraling around it--in truth, if I watch it fixedly, it makes me a bit nauseous!  What fun!  It reminds me of those spinning discs that hypnotists use.<br /><br />I think this would make a terrific stocking stuffer or gag gift for anyone who owns a device with a Type C plug (the flattened oval one).  My black-and-blue cable is currently fast charging my Samsung Galaxy S9 phone (with the USB end plugged into a Samsung Fast Charging AC adapter).  The cable also works for fast file transfers.<br /><br />A very cool thing about the cable is that the LED lights turn off when your mobile device is fully charged.  You can see at a glance that the device is ready to go.",1557095782129,0,False
1.0,Vent Clip Barely Fits Into 2003 Honda Civic’s Widest Vent Openings; Wireless Charging Is Convenient,"UPDATE 7/14/18:  Star rating downgraded from 4 stars to 1 star.  The wIreless charging pad is too flaky to rely upon.  After a week of use, my phone became reluctant to recognize the pad--or vice versa--and I had to reposition the phone, wiggle the cable, or plug and unplug the cable to get wireless charging to work at all.  The problem is with the charging pad, because the cable and &#34;cigarette lighter&#34; plug will charge my phone fast if the cable is plugged directly into the phone.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:  The vent clip clamps on this VENTEX WIRELESSPRO DOCK are almost too thick to fit into the widest vent openings (on the far left and right) in my 2003 Honda Civic.  The vent clip itself is very stiff to open, and barely opens wide enough to fit around the vent slats.  Once installed, the vent clip holds tightly and securely.<br /><br />The phone holder easily accepts my Samsung Galaxy S7+ (inside an Otterbox Symmetry case).  It’s nice to have a wireless charger on the dashboard, so that I don’t have to keep two phone cables in the car (one for a phone with a Micro AB port, and one for a phone with a Type C port).<br /><br />The wireless charger seems to work fine.  My Galaxy phone indicated right away that it was charging.  With a lock screen active display on, the charger added about 13% to the charge level during a 15-minute auto trip.<br /><br />With the power-draining Google Maps navigation display (with sound) turned on, the charger just barely maintained the existing charge level.  My phone was also quite hot afterwards--not uncommon with qi charging when a network connection is active, or with Google Maps live navigation generally--so in the future I’ll probably use the charging only when I’m NOT using Google Maps live navigation or am using it only briefly.<br /><br />The plug fits rather tightly into the DC power (“cigarette lighter”) receptacle on my Honda, but that’s okay. The cable is long enough to easily reach from the left side air vent to the receptacle, which is below the radio in the middle of the dashboard.",1530992632374,2,False
5.0,Rugged Unlocked Smartphone for GSM Cellular Networks,"This CAT S31 RUGGED WATERPROOF SMARTPHONE (Unlocked) is my first unlocked phone, and I really didn’t know what to expect.  What I discovered is that there are two types of phones:  (1) phones intended for GSM networks (AT&T, T-Mobile, Cricket, and other carriers), and (2) phones intended for CDMA networks (mainly Verizon and Sprint).<br /><br />If you try to sign this GSM phone up for a cellular plan at Verizon or Sprint—using the “Bring Your Own Phone” option—you are asked to check the phone’s compatibility by entering the 15-digit IMEI number (conveniently printed on the outside of the CAT S31 box).  Both networks return “incompatible”, so you will need to Google GSM to find compatible networks.  (You can’t add this incompatible phone to an existing Sprint or Verizon plan, either.)<br /><br />Cricket responded “compatible” and offered to sell me a SIM card and plan; ATT said “compatible, but can’t locate a suitable SIM card”, so I stopped there and went with Cricket.  There seem to be quite a few GSM networks around, though.<br /><br />By law, the phone will make emergency calls without a SIM card connection to a cellular network.<br /><br />While waiting for a SIM card and cellular connection, I can use this phone to connect to the Internet through my home network (powered by Comcast Xfinity).  Once connected to the network, my phone syncs automatically with my Google account.  The phone is generally quite easy to set up—especially if you’re already familiar with the Android interface and navigation.<br /><br />This is an extremely rugged phone, as advertised.  It has a thick rubber backing, sloped corners, and thick rubber bumpers on the edges.  There are rubber-stoppered openings in the bumpers for a USB charging cable, SIM card insertion, and Micro SD card insertion.  With the stoppers closed, the phone is highly resistant to dust, damp, and short immersions in water.  Picking up the phone, it feels so sturdy, I feel no need to purchase any additional case or screen protector.  The phone is comfortable to hold.<br /><br />The phone has front- and rear-facing cameras.  The cameras don’t match the quality of my Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phone, but they’re perfectly adequate for a heavy-duty outdoor-workplace-use phone.  The navigation isn’t as slick as the fancier phone, either, as the phone has physical buttons to push for “home”, “back”, and “recent apps” (instead of icons on the touchscreen).",1528750787057,32,False
3.0,"Fast Qi Charging, Slow Dual Charging","In general, I’m an iOttie fan, because iOttie products perform as advertised.  This ION WIRELESS PLUS FAST QI CHARGING PAD (7.5W for iOS; 10W for Android; USB-C Cable & Adapter Included; Dual Charge Feature; Ruby) is no exception, but it’s NOT perfect.<br /><br />As a fast Qi charger, it seems to charge as fast or faster than my Samsung fast Qi charger (2018 model).  When you place your phone on the iOttie pad, a white light comes on to signal that your phone is charging.<br /><br />A blinking red light is supposed to tell you that something is wrong and the phone is NOT charging, but the feature didn’t seem to work with my Galaxy S7 and S9 phones.  I saw the red light only once—when I was deliberately trying to place the phone in the wrong position—and it faded within a second or two. That’s okay, because the white light is all that’s needed to signal charging.<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTE:  The iOttie charging pad may turn off inexplicably, shortly after charging has begun, so that your planned extended charging doesn’t happen.  You need to check back after a few minutes, or occasionally, to make sure that the white light remains on.  I have experienced the same behavior with other Qi charging pads (including the Samsung pads), and I don’t know what the cause is.  However, the behavior doesn’t seem to occur if I turn off the phone’s wireless, Bluetooth, and network connections before charging.<br /><br />Your phone's charging light will tell you when charging is complete, because the pad does NOT do this.  (Most Qi charging pads only signal that the pad is actively charging.)  In fact, the white light will stay on when charging is at 100%, if your phone is using background apps that are drawing on the battery and causing the pad to continue replenishing the charge.<br /><br />The rubberized iOttie target grips the phone just enough to hold it in the correct charging position (in case your desktop or the pad is bumped).  The pad doesn’t heat your phone as much as the Samsung pads sometimes do.<br /><br />The iOttie pad will charge any Qi-enabled phone (not just the newer phones with USB-C charging ports), regardless of whether the phone is capable of fast wireless charging.  The pad requires a USB-C cable to connect to an AC power source, but doesn’t require USB-C to connect with and charge a device.  A USB-C cable and AC adapter are included in the box (and iOttie strongly recommends that you use only the supplied accessories).<br /><br />The dual charge feature (using the USB-A port) works, but it seems to charge the second device extremely slowly.  The speed seems about the same whether or not a Qi-enabled phone is being charged at the same time.  (I tested the dual charge feature with an Amazon Fire HD10 7th Gen tablet, which I usually charge with an ordinary USB cable plugged into a USB port on a charging station.)<br /><br />Overall, this is an attractive, small-footprint, easy-to-engage Qi-charging pad that looks great on any desktop.  I love the ruby color and the coarse-textured fabric cover.  Buy it for its good looks, and very fast Qi charging for phones capable of fast wireless charging.",1524677174391,0,False
4.0,"Attractive, Well-Made Case Adds Bulk, Weight to Large Galaxy S9 Phone","This OTTERBOX DEFENDER SERIES CASE (for Samsung Galaxy S9; colorway “Big Sur“ (Pale Beige/Corsair)) is an attractive dark teal color, with a light beige interior case.  Your phone goes into the two-piece beige case, then the encased phone goes into the teal case with rubber bumpers.  Finally a black, hard plastic cover with a belt clip/kickstand protects the glass display.  (There is no screen protector incorporated into this case.)<br /><br />This DEFENDER case fits my Galaxy S9 phone snugly, but it is also fairly easy to remove (if necessary).  I think it provides a LOT of protection for the phone—certainly it protects against moderate drops and minor contact with other items in a tote bag or backpack.<br /><br />However, it adds quite a bit of bulk and weight to the fairly large S9 phone, and the belt clip on the black display cover sticks out far enough to make it awkward to pick up or lay down the phone.  The belt clip functions as a kickstand when the phone is in landscape orientation—except that it takes considerable finger strength to snap the clip backwards into a fixed position.  The phone will fit either face up or face down into the black cover, but this extra belt-clip piece is clumsy to handle.<br /><br />The case covers the phone’s buttons, which all work fine with the case installed.  At the bottom of the phone, two hinged sections of the rubber bumper close the charging and earbud ports, to protect against water incursion.<br /><br />This is a well-made, good-looking case, but it’s too bulky and complicated for me.  I prefer the Otterbox Symmetry case, which I carry inside a synthetic leather holster that has a  belt clip.",1523842303472,2,False
5.0,Clear Case Shows Fingerprints; Provides Drop Protection Without Adding Bulk,"This OTTERBOX  SYMMETRY SERIES CASE (CLEAR) fits my Samsung Galaxy S9 phone snugly, but is still fairly easy to remove (if necessary).  It provides decent protection from short drops, and doesn’t add a lot of bulk or weight to the phone.  The case back is totally clear (displaying the phone’s metal back), and the case sides are cloudy white (like etched art glass).<br /><br />The thing to remember about a clear case, is that it shows fingerprints!  When you install this case, you should avoid touching the INSIDE of the case, or else your inside fingerprints will show up prominently after the case is installed.  To remove fingerprints from the inside or the outside of this case, use a microfiber cloth.<br /><br />This is one-piece case.  It covers only the back and sides of the phone, and it doesn’t include a screen protector.  The raised case rim provides minimal protection for the display when the phone is laid face down on a flat surface.  The phone’s buttons are covered by the case sides, but the buttons still work fine.",1523836605441,0,False
5.0,Fits Galaxy S9 Perfectly; Protects Phone Back From Scratches,"This ESR SLIM CRYSTAL CLEAR TRANSPARENT SOFT TPU CASE (for Samsung Galaxy S9 5.8&quot; (2018 Released)) fits my new Samsung Galaxy S9 smartphone perfectly, and doesn’t interfere with wireless charging.  It’s exactly what I needed to protect the phone until I can decide on a permanent case.  (My preordered phone arrived 2 days ahead of the official 3/16/18 release date.  When you preorder a new phone, you usually have to wait a month or so before the major manufacturers (e.g., Otterbox) start selling cases.)<br /><br />This case is easy to install or remove, and looks very nice.  It will protect the back of the Samsung Galaxy S9 from scratches.  It will also help protect the phone from minor drops, because it adds cushioning on the back and around the edges.",1521148355410,4,True
5.0,Hasn’t Dropped S7 Edge Cell Phone Yet,"This IOTTIE ONE TOUCH AIR VENT CAR MOUNT HOLDER (for iPhone X, 8/8 Plus, 7/7 Plus, 6s/6s Plus, 6, SE; Samsung Galaxy S8/S8 Plus, S7/S7 Edge, S6,  Note 8, Note 5) is simple to install, and holds my moderately heavy Galaxy S7 Edge quite securely. The holder also uninstalls quickly, and doesn’t damage my Honda Civic’s vents.<br /><br />The holder clamps onto vent “slat”, so it works best with a vent that is stationary (one that doesn’t swivel or otherwise move to direct air towards or away from the driver).  The holder can gradually pull off the vent as you repeatedly insert and remove your phone, so you’ll want to check the vent clamp from time to time to make sure it isn’t loose.<br /><br />I’ve been using my iOttie holder for a year now, and It hasn’t dropped my S7 Edge yet.  The holder swivels for a lot of angles, so I can adjust the phone for the best Google Maps display when I’m using the phone for navigation.  I’m very satisfied with this holder.",1514861979805,0,False
4.0,"Well-Made, Secure Runner’s Case—But Phone Removal Is Difficult","This GEAR BEAST SPORTS HANDHELD RUNNING CASE (for Galaxy S8, S8 Plus, S7 Edge, Note 8 5;  iPhone 6s Plus, 6 Plus), holds a Galaxy S8 Plus (without a case) or a Galaxy S7 Edge (with an Otterbox Symmetry case) very securely.<br /><br />The smartphone slides into the case through a slit in a soft, rubbery, case backing.  The backing makes the case comfortable to hold.  There are holes in the backing that allow you to connect earphones when the phone is inside the case.  The wide Velcro-secured strap makes the case easy to grip.<br /><br />The case does NOT interfere with the touchscreen sensitivity at all. However, the clear plastic window (through which you view the touchscreen) sticks tightly to the screen protector on the phone when you try to remove the phone from the case.  (The case window isn’t tacky or covered with adhesive, it’s just that the plastic window and plastic screen protector stick to each other like plastic food-covering film.)<br /><br />This makes it difficult to remove the smartphone from the case—in my opinion, a major design flaw.  But for that, this is a well-made, securely stitched case that performs well as a handheld phone case for runners.",1510629144832,1,False
4.0,Terrific Protective Case for Fairly Weighty Phone,"This OTTERBOX DEFENDER SERIES CASE FOR GALAXY S8+ (Screen Protector Not Included; Cowabunga Blue/Gunmetal Grey) is a terrific protective case for a fairly weighty, curved-screen phone.  It consists of a two-piece plastic inner case that cradles the phone, and a rubber slipcover for the inner case that surrounds the phone with a thick bumper.  There is no screen protector (found on many Defender series cases for other phones), because of the S8+’s curved touchscreen.<br /><br />The only negative feature of this protective case is that the rubber slipcover interferes with wireless charging.  However, wireless charging works normally with the slipcover off, and the slipcover is easy to remove and replace.<br /><br />A separate hard plastic piece fits over the display, covering it completely.  This piece has a belt clip that holds the phone firmly.  I like this, as my strong preference is for belt-clip or holster cases.<br /><br />The belt clip can be held open by a small tab, so that the clip functions as a mini stand (for viewing the display in landscape position only).  It’s hard to engage the hold-open tab, and the “stand” is not adjustable, so this feature is not a reason to buy the case.<br /><br />The rubber slipcover is grey.  The inner plastic case is an unusual shade of bright blue (almost teal).  The plastic cover piece with the belt clip is black.<br /><br />NOTE:  All protective cases for the curved touchscreens (Galaxy S7 Edge, S8, S8+) leave the curved portion of the display unprotected at the sides (showing slightly above the edge of the case).  This is necessary to provide full functionality for the curved portions of the touchscreen.  If you drop a curved-screen phone face down when the touchscreen is uncovered, you may crack the screen, no matter what case you’re using.  When the belt-clip piece of this case is used, the display is fully covered and reasonably well protected.",1508303512498,0,False
5.0,"Sturdy, Solid Stand Fits iPad, Galaxy S7 Edge","This beautifully made, sturdy UNIVERSAL DUAL FOLDABLE MULTI ANGLE PHONE/TABLET STAND is the best adjustable stand ever!  It fits both my iPad Air2 and my Galaxy S7 Edge phone, incredible as that may sound.<br /><br />The cradle portion has curved-up tips with gripper lining that holds a large tablet or a small cellphone securely.  The stand portion can be adjusted to virtually any viewing angle or height.  The base portion has gripper backing so it doesn’t slide on the surface beneath it.<br /><br />In using this with an iPad, you can adjust the cradle to rest on a table, along with the base, and this creates a really solid stand that doesn’t rock or jiggle when you type on it.  The folding joints are quite stiff—it takes some hand pressure to move them—but this is a good thing, because they “remember” their position.  The stand does NOT collapse easily.<br /><br />I love the light charcoal, metallic “Space Gray” color.  I also love the compact size (3-⅝” x 5-½” folded), and small tabletop footprint.",1508095324576,1,False
5.0,Faux Marble in Teal/Gold Sets This Case Apart,"Shiny gold marbling on a translucent pale teal ground makes this INCIPIO MARBLE (DESIGN SERIES) case for the Samsung  Galaxy S7 Edge far more interesting than the usual faux-marble-patterned cell phone cases.  It’s a beauty!<br /><br />The teal bumper around the display looks marvelous on my gold phone.  The gold veins on the back of the case give the impression that the metal of the gold phone is shining through.  This is a very stylish case; it works for me because I carry my phone in a leather belt holster, not loose in a bag.<br /><br />The single-piece case (no cover for the display) is shock-absorbing and scratch resistant.  It provides limited drop protection (very short drops only).  It consists of a hard plastic shell over a rubber bumper that completely surrounds the phone (buttons are covered, but work well).  The case carries a 1-year Incipio warranty against defects in material and workmanship.",1499469889211,1,False
3.0,Glass Screen Protector Is So-So Choice for Curved-Edge Displays,"The Otterbox Alpha Glass screen protector for my husband’s flat-display Samsung Galaxy S7 works great, but this OTTERBOX ALPHA GLASS SERIES SCREEN PROTECTOR FOR SAMSUNG GALAXY S7 EDGE is only so-so.<br /><br />The screen protector fits the curved-edge display of the S7 Edge perfectly, but it has adhesive only at the top and bottom of the glass protector.  This makes the screen protector easy to apply, bubble-free, but doesn't seal the curved edges.<br /><br />If you have one of the curved-edge Galaxy phones, you're better off with a wet-installation screen protector that has adhesive in contact with the entire display.  Even with those, you need to let the installation dry for a few hours if you want the edges to stay in place.  The Galaxy curved-edge displays present a real challenge to the makers of screen protectors!",1498679109276,0,False
5.0,Stunning Kate Spade Design Case From Incipio,"This shock-absorbing KATE SPADE NEW YORK COVER FOR THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S7 EDGE (Rose Gold/Cream) is absolutely stunning when added to a gold-colored S7 Edge smartphone.  The reddish gold lightning bands on the hard plastic back add a striking accent, while the clear plastic in between the bands allows the beautiful gold metal of the phone itself to shine through.<br /><br />The clear rubber bumpers around the edges don't detract at all from the curved-edge Galaxy phone display.  The case fits like a glove.  It has rubber buttons covering the phone’s power and volume buttons, but the buttons work fine.<br /><br />In the box, the lightning bands appear to be copper-colored, but they turn to gold on a gold phone.  This is an Incipio case, with a 1-year Incipio warranty.  The case design is from Kate Spade.",1497048593252,0,False
5.0,Case Back Sparkles in Light As If Animated,"This OTTERBOX SYMMETRY CLEAR SERIES “STARDUST” CASE (for Samsung Galaxy S8+; Silver Flake/Clear) looks wonderful on my “Arctic Silver” Galaxy S8+ phone.  The back really sparkles, and the “stars” seem to move (as if animated) with only the slightest movement of the phone in your hand.<br /><br />The back of the case is clear plastic with silver flakes; the bumper that surrounds the phone is silvery gray.  This case would be positively gorgeous if the bumper were completely clear.  (Any color at all in the bumper interferes a little with the “unbox your phone” concept of the curved-edge Galaxy S8+.)<br /><br />Because I carry my S8+ in a holster case (see [[ASIN:B00OMODOYO leatherette case]]), an Otterbox Symmetry series case provides adequate protection for short drops and scratches.  The back of the phone is completely covered, and the rubber bumper is built up at the top and bottom so that the phone can be laid face down with care.<br /><br />The Symmetry case doesn't add much bulk, or extra weight.  It is easily removed from the phone (which is necessary if you want to use the Galaxy S8+ phone's oddly shaped, wide-shouldered Type C USB to USB cable adapter for transferring files by cable).  The bumper has raised “buttons” over the phone's buttons, rather than cutouts for the buttons.",1495035936000,36,True
5.0,Beautiful Printed Swan Design; Very-Short-Drop Protection; Clear Plastic Shows Off Phone’s Color,"The INCIPIO DESIGN SERIES GLAM CASES (for Samsung Galaxy S8+) don't promise a specific level of drop protection, but they're beautiful cases.  They consist of a cushiony but strong plastic bumper that is fused with a printed hard plastic shell.<br /><br />All of the plastic is crystal clear, so the back of your Galaxy phone shows (or shines) through.  The clear plastic bumper detracts only slightly from the advertised “unbox your phone” effect of the Galaxy S8+.  The bumper has raised ridges covering the phone’s buttons, but the ridges are easy to press, and they work almost as well as the uncovered buttons.<br /><br />My case has the “Love Birds” pattern, with the two swans touching bills.  The design looks fabulous on my silver phone, because the swans’ wings and crowns are printed in gleaming gold.  The product page photo doesn't do justice to this design.<br /><br />This is a well-made case, and I believe the ad claim that it’s coated with a “premium scratch-resistant finish” to maintain sheen and provide durability.  My phone lives in a clip-on holster case that offers all-around protection, so this “glam” case provides adequate protection--and great good looks--when I’m actually using the phone.  The case is very comfortable to hold.",1494467132000,1,False
4.0,Minimalist Flexible Polymer Sleeve With Nice Gripper Edges; Drop-Tested to 5 Feet,"This INCIPIO NGP ADVANCED CASE FOR SAMSUNG GALAXY S8+ (Plum) is a minimalist flexible polymer case that protects against minor drops.  (It's drop-tested to 5 feet.)  I like the elegant dark purple color, the modestly textured back and sides, and the feel of the case in my hand.  The gripper edges make the Galaxy S8+ (a tall, fairly heavy cellphone) easier to hold.<br /><br />Like most single-layer “rubber” cases, this one has raised, built-in “buttons” that cover the phone’s buttons.  They keep dust out of the phone (unlike cases with cutouts around the buttons), but make the buttons slightly harder to press.<br /><br />Any case that is added to the curved-edge Galaxy S8+ phone will detract from the advertised “infinity” or “unboxed” look.  So if you're going to add your own “box”, you probably should at least consider a case that offers more cushioning against drops.",1494418722000,0,False
5.0,Box Includes Everything You Need for Perfect Installation on Galaxy S8+,"This G-COLOR SCREEN PROTECTOR is a good, inexpensive choice for the Galaxy S8+.  It provides the same vertical coverage as the temporary protective film that comes on the S8+ cellphone as shipped, with more complete horizontal coverage.  It goes all the way to the side edges.  The wet installation--something that I usually hate--is safe for the phone, and results in excellent, lasting adhesion over the curved sides of the display.<br /><br />You can remove the plastic film even after it has been drying for a few hours.  My film trapped one prominent speck of dust that I couldn't ignore, so I pulled up about one-fourth of the film, re-sprayed the lifted portion to release the dust mote, and smoothed the film down again.  The film is now looking as if it was never repositioned.<br /><br />Once applied, the plastic film is crystal clear.  It doesn't affect the screen sensitivity in the slightest.  Tiny bubbles left over from the installation disappear in a few days.<br /><br />The clear, photo-illustrated steps for installation need to be followed carefully, but installation isn't difficult.  Note that this is NOT &#34;a simple stick-on film&#34;, as some reviewers have remarked.  One side of the film is tacky, but this &#34;sticky&#34; side must be moistened with wetting solution, or it will not adhere to the screen surface.<br /><br />You receive only one piece of protective film, but you also get everything you need to ensure a perfect or near-perfect result.  The box includes film, a good-sized microfiber cloth, a sticky dust-mote remover, an alcohol swab, a bubble-smoother card, an ample spray bottle of wetting solution, and a clear plastic case to use for 2-3 days while the wetting solution is drying.<br /><br />My Galaxy S8+ looks like a million dollars!",1494275276000,0,True
4.0,"No-Nonsense, One-Piece Case for Galaxy S8+; Drop-Tested to 12 Feet","This INCIPIO DUALPRO CASE FOR SAMSUNG GALAXY S8+ (Black/Black) is a good, no-nonsense, one-piece case that fits my Galaxy S8+ smartphone perfectly.  There's a cutout in back for the fingerprint sensor, camera flash, and camera lens; there are holes or cutouts in all the right places for the light sensor, mic, charging port, and headset jack.  There are raised “buttons” for the on/off button, the Bixby button, and the volume buttons.<br /><br />The case itself has a silky feel when you hold it in your hand.  The “dual-layer protection” consists of a rigid outer shell and a flexible silicone bumper.  The case is advertised as drop-tested to 12 feet--I didn't personally test this.<br /><br />You’ll want to use a screen protector with this case.  The bumper doesn't rise above the side edges--of necessity, because of the curved screen--and it doesn't rise very high above the top and bottom edges.  If you lay your S8+ face down carelessly, it's possible to scratch the screen.<br /><br />This is a nice, serviceable, reasonably priced case.  It works for me, because I carry my phone in a leatherette holster case that protects the screen (see, e.g., [[ASIN:B00OMODOYO an S7 Edge case that also fits my S8+ phone]]).<br /><br />EDIT 4/26/17:  The silky finish that I liked at first turns out to be a drawback.  The Galaxy S8+ is a tall, fairly heavy smartphone, and it slides through my hand unless I grip the DualPro Case rather tightly.  This case does appear to give good drop-protection, though.",1492913637000,10,True
2.0,Too Short for Galaxy S7 Edge Plus Otterbox Commuter Case,"This BOMEA PREMIUM SAMSUNG GALAXY S7 EDGE VERTICAL HOLSTER CASE is a nice leather case for the price ($9.95 On Amazon).  However, it barely fits my &#34;naked&#34; S7 Edge; and it's too short for an S7 Edge with an Otterbox Commuter case on.  With the Commuter case on, the flap with the magnetic closure won't close.<br /><br />Because I doubt that this case will fit any combination of S7 Edge plus protective case, I rate it at 2 stars (&#34;I don't like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).  A case that does fit my S7 Edge with the Otterbox Commuter case on is the  iPhone XXL 6Plus case (ASIN B00X6QC9WW),  It's a little large, but not at all bad.  However, I haven't used the iPhone 6Plus case long enough to know whether the clip will last.",1474228108000,0,True
2.0,Fits Too Tightly--Phone Won't Pop Into Case,"This SPECK PRODUCTS SAMSUNG GALAXY S7 EDGE CASE (CANDY SHELL CLEAR, MILITARY GRADE PROTECTIVE) looks wonderful, because it's entirely clear.  It lets my phone's gold color show through--or it would, if the fit weren't so tight that I need a mini-prybar to get it onto the phone!  My Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge simply will NOT pop into this case.  I tried inserting the top first, the bottom first, and each side first, but nothing worked.<br /><br />I think that the case is actually a couple of millimeters too short.  Probably I could force this case onto my phone if I used a tool (maybe a spudger), because the case is slightly stretchy at the top and bottom edges.  I'm not willing to do this, though.  If I shoehorn the case on, I'll never be able to get it off again without scratching or breaking the phone.<br /><br />Because I would like this case a lot if it were a tiny bit larger, and I think it's possible to shoehorn it onto a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phone, I rate it at 2 stars (&#34;I don't like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).<br /><br />EDIT:  The manufacturer commented on another review that there are case installation instructions on its web page.  I looked at the video for installing the Candy Shell case on an iPhone, but it didn't help.  I did try to install the case starting from the side, but it certainly didn't pop in as shown in the iPhone video.  Perhaps my hands just aren't strong enough.",1461366341000,2,False
5.0,"Properly Fits Galaxy S7 Edge Phone That Is Inside Protective ""Half Case""","My Galaxy S7 Edge smartphone is in a lightweight &#34;half case&#34; made of hard plastic and rubber that provides drop protection but covers only the phone back and sides (see [[ASIN:B01B1V3QUW UAG Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge Feather-Light Composite [ICE] Phone Case]]).  My S7 Edge phone still slides easily into this GALAXY S7 EDGE VERTICAL LEATHER HOLSTER (sold by Anma Direct), and the case's magnetic-closure flap closes completely with the encased phone inside.  The phone fits snugly into this vertical holster case, but is still easy to pull out when needed.<br /><br />This holster case is made of padded faux leather that feels like really soft, thin leather.  It has a solidly attached belt clip.  It's exactly what I wanted, and it completely lives up to my expectations from the Amazon product description.",1461091751000,9,True
4.0,"Simple ""Half-Case"" Fits Galaxy S7 Edge Perfectly, Provides Drop Protection","This UAG SAMSUNG GALAXY S7 EDGE FEATHER-LIGHT COMPOSITE PHONE CASE (ICE) is a very good &quot;half-case&quot; that covers the phone back.  The case is lightweight, fits the S7 Edge perfectly, and provides drop protection.  Since the screen is NOT covered, the phone is ready to use the minute you pick it up.  However, I'm not comfortable with any case that doesn't completely surround the phone--in my heart, I know that if I drop the phone, it will drop screen-side down.<br /><br />I love the fact that the &quot;Ice&quot; color case is made of clear plastic, with black rubber only at the edges.  The clear plastic lets the gold metal of the phone itself show through.  The black rubber parts hold the phone securely, and provide cushioning.  Unfortunately, there are no cutouts on the sides for the volume buttons and on/off button.  Instead, there are black rubber buttons that overlay the buttons on the phone itself.  These work fine, but they don't feel as nice as the &quot;real&quot; buttons.<br /><br />The case is cut down on the sides sufficiently to allow full use of the &quot;edge&quot; feature of the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge--the black rubber stops short of the curved glass portion of the phone's screen.  Note that this is neither a holster case nor a stand case--the back merely covers the phone back and holds the surrounding drop-protection bumper in place.  Because of the rubber buttons and the lack of a screen cover, I rate this otherwise excellent case at 4 stars (&quot;I like it&quot; on the official Amazon scale).",1460918013000,6,False
2.0,Great Design But Too Small for Most Knitting Notions,"The PERFECT NOTION CASE has a great design, but it is too small!  The case has two storage compartments, each measuring 3-1/2"" wide by 2"" high by 1/2"" deep.  One compartment is undivided; the other compartment is divided into five smaller compartments.  Each individual storage area has a separate lid.  The product photo illustrates this quite clearly.<br /><br />The largest compartment isn't deep enough to hold a flat lip balm container or a spring-powered rollup tape measure, and it isn't long enough to hold a cable needle or a pair of embroidery scissors.  The only knitting notions I have that will fit in any of the compartments are point protectors, plain stitch markers, T-pins (for blocking), very small [[ASIN:B000QHD65S Boye stitch holders-1-3/4""]], and my beloved [[ASIN:B0019KAEEC Clover Lock Ring Markers]].<br /><br />The lids on the compartments snap firmly into place, and the outer case is firmly secured with a gate-type latch.  If this case were larger (perhaps 6"" x 4"" x 1""), it would be a wonderful case.  But as it is, the case is far too small to be of much practical use.  I purchased two of these cases sight unseen from my usual knitting goods supplier, and regret the purchase. I rate the PERFECT NOTION CASE at 2 stars (""I don't like it"" on the Amazon scale).",1342907118000,5,False
4.0,Fancy Adaptor Converts AC Outlet to USB Outlet,"This RCA USB Charger with Night Glow is a fancy adaptor that converts any standard North American AC outlet to a standard USB outlet for charging battery-powered devices.  You supply the connector cord with USB plug that is appropriate for your device.  The charger works fine when plugged into a surge protector/battery backup AC outlet.<br /><br />What's fancy about this charger is the blue night light, and the orange full charge indicator.  When the charger is plugged in, the blue ring lights up from behind in three places, which provides a pleasant blue glow.  When your device is charging, a gray ring around the black central area lights up in orange.  The orange light turns off when your device is fully charged.  The charger comes with a large cap that snaps on over the back to cover the AC plug and create a neat cylindrical package for travelling.<br /><br />This little adaptor charged my iPod Touch--starting from an empty battery--in about 65 minutes. I like the charger, but was disappointed to learn that it isn't really a traveler's bedside  night light.  That is, instead of resting flat on a bedside table or desktop, it must be plugged directly into an AC outlet, which is usually a wall outlet.  It also doesn't provide much room illumination.  For this reason, I rate it at 4 stars (""I like it"" on the Amazon scale).",1340672407000,1,False
4.0,"A Slim, Elegant Stylus, But Less Responsive Than Other Styluses","Capacitive styluses are not all alike.  Besides color, there are subtle differences in sensitivity, length, barrel size, weight, and attachment clips or lanyards.  This BoxWave stylus, which is 4-7/8"" long (exclusive of the capacitive tip) is disappointing, because it doesn't perform nearly as well as the excellent, shorter [[ASIN:B0008G3ID2 BoxWave Capacitive Kindle Fire Stylus]].<br /><br />Compared to other styluses that I tested, this BoxWave stylus is the longest, has the slimmest barrel, and is lightest in weight.  I loved its elegant, slender appearance, but found that holding such a thin barrel made my hand ache after a while.  Also, the slimmer barrel, and the correspondingly smaller capacitive tip, may explain why this stylus isn't as sensitive or responsive as other  styluses.  Frequently I had to tap the touchscreen more than once, or press down harder on the touchscreen to get a response.  The small tip is good for accuracy in selecting small targets (e.g., links displayed in web browsers in tiny fonts), but accuracy doesn't matter if a light touch won't register.  The extra length is a plus, if you hold a stylus like a pointer (away from the tip), rather than like a pencil (close to the tip).<br /><br />For attaching to other things, this stylus has a pocket clip, a lanyard with a plastic end that can be plugged into an earphones outlet, and a great lobster-claw (necklace-type) fastener with jump ring that opens to detach the lanyard.  Besides this stylus, I tested the [[ASIN:B005O2URES MiniSuit Universal Capacitive Stylus Pen]], the [[ASIN:B0008G3ID2 BoxWave Capacitive Kindle Fire Stylus]], the [[ASIN:B004JU1MNG Targus Stylus for Apple iPad]], and the [[ASIN:B004GCJEZU AmazonBasics Stylus for Touchscreen Devices]].  My favorite is the AmazonBasics Stylus, because of its 4-1/4"" length, slim barrel, light weight, and excellent sensitivity; the shorter BoxWave stylus is a close second.  I rate this stylus at 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars (""I like it""),  because it is so attractive.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, as I was, what a ""capacitive"" stylus is, it is a human interface device (e.g., a mouse) that uses ""capacitive sensing"" to measure changes of position on a touchscreen.  It works just like a human finger on a touchscreen device, and you can often get more accurate navigation using a stylus.

My main reason for getting this was privacy, which it does very well.",1672432411549,0,False
5.0,Awesome! Wireless Apple Watch charging is so useful!,"This thing is great. It's not too big, has a decent capacity (10,000 mAh), and has wireless charging capability. Additionally, it has a little stand on the back that you can use to prop up the battery (and thus, prop up your phone). My experience has only been with iPhones and Apple Watches.<br /><br />My biggest gripe is that the wireless charging with iPhones is very slow (5w if I had to guess); much slower than the Apple MagSafe charger. Fortunately, if you have an iPhone, you can plug in a USB-C to lightning cable to get 18w charging.<br /><br />My favorite thing about the battery is that it can wirelessly charge an Apple Watch (I have a Series 6). I'm not exactly sure of the AW charging speed, but it feels like it is the same speed as the non-fast charging Apple Watch charger.<br /><br />This thing is great, and I'd definitely recommend it.",1669592529793,0,False
5.0,Sturdy Phone Holder! Way better than a tripod for desk use,"This is a much better way to mount my iPhone (which I've been using as a webcam) than the little tripod I've been using. My problem before was that the tripod would shake any time there was any movement on my desk (like writing or typing). That said, this gooseneck mount solves all of those problems.<br /><br />The gooseneck is very firm and requires a little bit of strength to get into the right position. Fortunately, once you have it where you want it, it does not move. The phone clip is large enough to hold any cell phone and the table clip can fit on a table up to 2.5"" or so (maybe a little larger).<br /><br />The non-gooseneck parts of the mount are plastic. The gooseneck has a braided (if you can call it that) covering over it, but I would imagine it is some sort of metal underneath, based on how firm it is. It does not move at all once it’s in position.<br /><br />If you are looking for a sturdy phone mount that is much more flexible than a tripod, I would definitely recommend this.",1668226536887,0,False
5.0,Fantastic! Replaces 2 chargers in my bag,"This is a fantastic charger, especially if you are traveler. The charger has a nice heft to it and feels well-built (i.e., not plasticky like some other wall chargers). Additionally, it comes with 3 different attachments to use when traveling abroad; the attachments simply clip on top of the US plug.<br /><br />The charger has 2x USB-C and 1x USB-A with a total output of 140w (120w if you are using more than 1 charging port). Individually, when used alone, the 3 ports output the following:<br /><br />USB-C 1: 140w<br />USB-C 2: 100w<br />USB-A: 30w<br /><br />These outputs are more than enough to charge a MacBook Pro or fast charge an iPhone. The orange color is a nice bonus (and easily spotted in a bag of white and black cables!)<br /><br />Would definitely recommend!",1667776798491,0,False
4.0,Decent case. Not as soft as the Apple leather case,"I typically use Apple leather cases on my phones, so this is my first non-Apple leather case. The case is sturdy and appears to provide good protection. There are also elevated plastic buttons on the side for the power and volume buttons. There's a cutout to reach the silent/ring switch. It also has Magsafe, and the magnet in the case appears to be pretty strong (maybe even a little stronger than the phone magnet without a case)<br /><br />The most noticeable difference between this and the Apple leather case is the softness of the leather. The Apple cases are quite soft, whereas this is significantly harder. I'm not a leather expert, but that might be due to the construction, as this has a ""cracked"" leather appearance (see pics), and the Apple cases are clean/not cracked.<br /><br />Another thing that I would change is the location of the brand name around the camera. I would definitely have preferred the brand name was stamped into the leather/elsewhere vs. being written twice around the camera.<br /><br />In my experience, the Apple leather cases will last around a year (which isn't great), or maybe a little less, before they really begin to wear (i.e., color coming off, etc.), so TBD how this one stacks up.<br /><br />Overall a decent case. But for $10 more, I'd probably just go with the Apple one.",1667428305198,0,False
5.0,Nice armband that does the job,"Before I received this armband, I was squeezing my iPhone 14 Pro Max into an armband designed for a much smaller phone. Fortunately, I can throw that old armband away, as this one does a great job holding my large phone. And it has pockets for my ID and keys! I think my favorite thing about this armband is the zipped pocket where I can put my keys (my greatest fear is that I'll lose my keys while running).<br /><br />The one critique I have about this armband is that it is a universal armband for any phone (up to 6.9""), and not specifically just the iPhone Pro Max (6.7""). As a result, there is a little extra space around my Pro Max, but it is not so much that the phone moves around during my run.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good case at a good price.",1666758164617,0,False
5.0,Great Mount. Strong Magnet!,"I have an iPhone 14 Pro Max, so a big concern I had Was that the magnet would not be strong enough to hold the iPhone. Fortunately this hasn't been an issue, as the magnet is quite strong.<br /><br />I also appreciated that it included the air vent mount and the dashboard/windshield mount. Additionally, you have the option of plugging the magnet in, so that your phone also charges while it's mounted. I've primarily been using the air vent mount and have not had any issues. I'd recommend this mount!",1666756870793,0,False
5.0,Great for heated vests!,"Picked this up for my heated vest and it works great. The size is great because it fits in the pocket without any issues (the battery that I had before was too long to fit in the pocket). I also appreciate that there is a display that shows the current battery level rather than a random light indicator.<br /><br />My only gripes are: (1) that the included USB cable is very short. Like 2"". And (2) it would have been great if it came with an AC adapter.",1666590130839,0,False
5.0,Great case! Kickstand is super useful,"I've gotten this kickstand case for my last 3 iPhones, and they have never let me down.

5.0,Great price for a 20W USB C charger!,"I bought this so I could fast charge my iPhone and Apple Watch with the new chargers. While this charger is a little bigger than the 5W Apple charger, it packs 4x the power. Works great with the wireless MagSafe puck and the Apple Watch fast charger. I recommend this!",1640331202948,0,False
5.0,Gets the job done!,"I bought this to use purely as a camera mount/phone stand, so my review doesn't account for using it as a selfie stick or using the remote to take pictures remotely (I tried and I'm not sure how to do it anyway).<br /><br />The stand is stable and is adjustable to many different heights. I use a 27"" monitor and I have the stand behind it without issues (and it could go higher). Also, it folds up into a 6"" handle which is useful for when I don't have the stand up.<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy with the purchase and I would purchase it again!",1624986635657,0,False
3.0,"Nice case, but lacking in durability","I purchased this case approximately 5 months ago. It was great at first, but over time, the case has yellowed and it has actually become warped (to the point where my phone will come out of it if I pick it up the wrong way).<br /><br />Other than the durability, the kickstand is quite useful and sturdy. My only critique on the kickstand is that when using the kickstand to prop your phone horizontally, the volume buttons are on the bottom (meaning you have to pick up the phone to change the volume). It would have been better if the kickstand was oriented the other way so that the volume buttons would be on the top when the phone is horizontal. The kickstand issue is quite minor and doesn't affect my use of the case in a major way.<br /><br />Other than those two issues, I think it is a good case. I wasn't sure how useful the kickstand would be at first, but after using it, I can say it's quite a nice thing to have!",1623906816003,0,True

However, within 4 uses the pads that protect your phone all started falling off. We keep having to tape them in place with each time we take the phones out of the holder.<br />We also had a phone that isn’t in a case and the pressure from the spring-loaded sides was too much for the phone (iPhone) and the phone is now warped and separating at the sides, exposing the inside of the phone.

2.0,Stands become unstable easily and both stands are required to hold anything larger than a phone,"There are two telescoping stands in the box. One is white and one is black. The stands unfold and extend and bend into a few angles and heights. Note, however, that the pictures as to its use are highly deceiving on the Amazon site. The site shows a large tablet with one stand and such a scenario is not possible because using one stand for something larger than a phone will cause it to tip over no matter how I change the angle.<br /><br />I actually had to use two stands to hold my fire tablet. However, if I tap the screen, the stands keep wanting to tilt over. In some cases, the base comes a little off the table as I type. The same happens with a phone. Of course, most tablets and phones used on a stand(s) like this will have covers making them heavier than without a cover. It is not realistic not to have a cover for protection and there is no way I will remove the cover to use this.<br /><br />These are also cheaply made. The white stand has a missing rubber piece on the ""front hook clip"" as can be seen in the photos.<br /><br />In summary, this will hold a small iPhone ""lightly"" but not a tablet unless one uses both stands. In addition, the slight force exerted by typing on the phone or tablet can cause the stand to tip over. I personally feel there are better options out there. For instance, I have a [[ASIN:B07HBQSCM3 Boyata Laptop Stand]] that is superb.",1594077862907,1,False
4.0,Highly responsive stylus for notebooks or touch screens; comes w/4 tips,"At the current price of $11.99 plus 10% off, I think this is a good deal.<br /><br />This works on my LG Notebook, iPad, Google Nexus 7, and Samsung Galaxy Tab. The only one it is a bit touchy on is my LG Notebook as I have to press harder on that screen. On the other three devices all stylus tips are extremely responsive. The only negative is that to get to the pen or the clear tip, one has to unscrew the chamber. Other than this, I love this better than a previous stylus I was using.<br /><br />On the interior of the cylinder is a ballpoint pen and a clear disk tip. On either end of the exterior, is a rubber tip and fiber mesh tip. One replacement tip for each of the four types is provided (see plastic bag in photos 1 & 2). Based on my tests, I do not feel one tip is better over the other. I was able to work with all of them. I personally prefer the rubber or fiber tips over the clear one but none have perfect precision (see last photo). They are just all good enough for what I need this for.<br /><br />In addition to the extra set of tips, it also comes with a fake leather sleeve. Overall, I really like this stylus.",1566603822196,0,False
3.0,Jabra Freeway is very sleek; VoiceAssist is great!,"The Jabra Freeway is very sleek and comes with a free and optional one-year subscription to VoiceAssist.<br /><br />Setting the unit up was easy.<br />1. Before I could use the Jabra Freeway, I charged it for two hours using the supplied USB cable with car charger.<br />2. Next I made sure the cell phone was Bluetooth-enabled and turned on the Jabra unit.<br />3. It immediately went into pairing mode.  As it is pairing with the phone device, the prompts on the phone needed to be followed and the supplied security code had to be entered (not everyone will have to enter a security code; it depends on the phone)<br />4. After this I began making and answering calls using voice commands, checking the battery power of the unit, etc.  To make a call, I had to press the Voice button to wake up the unit and say ""phone commands.""  If I was unsure of how to speak to the unit I would say ""What can I say?"" and it would give me options.<br /><br />What I found very frustrating was:<br />1. Once I was done with a call, ending the call is not hands free.  I couldn't say ""hang-up, or cancel, or end"" because that doesn't work.  Instead I had to press the ""answer end button"" (which is the ""phone icon"" on the Jabra device) or end the call via the phone end button.<br />2. I also disliked having to press the Voice button every time I wanted to make a call because this meant it was not totally hands free.  The only hands free part is if someone is calling you, the unit then automatically awakes and you can tell it to ""answer"" or ""ignore"" the incoming call.<br />3. Many times I asked the unit to make a call.  Twice it brought up the EZ tip calculator, once it brought up the one-minute beep ""application,"" and another time it brought up some other application on the phone that I didn't ask for.  Another time I tried to call someone and instead it brought up the address book and rambled off both the mobile and work number without giving me the option to dial either one.<br /><br />What I really loved was the optional VoiceAssist package even though I had difficulty getting this set up because the code to redeem the free one-year subscription was hidden underneath a sticker either Amazon or the manufacturer put on the box.  However, VoiceAssist has the best live customer service around.  In fact we called each other almost five times to get this situation resolved in a few hours. Hopefully, new purchasers won't have this experience where the offer code is hidden between stickers and impossible to read even after being held up to the light.<br /><br />Below are the steps I took to get VoiceAssist to work:<br />1. I had to first redeem the free offer code on the box by going to [....].<br />2. Once signed in online to [....],  I imported all my Gmail contacts into the VoiceAssist application and also set up a connection to my review_maven twitter account ([....]).<br />3. Once registered and after I cleaned up the Gmail import which had about an 85% accuracy rate, I then needed to program the number of 949-257-0923 under the name of VoiceAssist into the Bluetooth phone.<br />4. After this I had a lot of fun:<br />  -  I used the Jabra unit to call VoiceAssist.<br />  - Once connected I used another set of VoiceAssist commands to ""call"" people in my contact list (they had to have a phone # in the Gmail contact listed that was imported), to ""post to Twitter,"" to ""read my e-mail"" on Gmail--which it read very well (except it said it couldn't read the pictures), and to send an email, which it sent okay though some of my message was garbled.  However, since an MP3 was attached to the email, the person receiving it could play that to get the full message.<br />  - The two posts to my Twitter account were okay, buy it got VoiceAssist wrong and typed voices instead and it typed Jabra as Java. You can look on the review_maven account to see the posts for May 28. 2011.<br /><br />I didn't have the phone functionality to try the FM Transmitter or play music features of the Jabra device.<br /><br />Below are some of the key features that I liked and some things I disliked:<br /><br /> PROS:<br />1. The Jabra unit is pretty easy to set up<br />2. The Jabra Freeway has a long battery life (about 14 to 17 hours)<br />3. You can pair two Bluetooth phones to the device with the last phone paired being the primary one<br />4. Jabra Freeway comes with a car charger for charging in your vehicle or with a 12Volt Battery Pack; the USB cable that is used to plug in the car adapter can be used without the adapter for charging with your PC<br />5. A free one-year subscription to VoiceAssist is supplied with purchase<br />6. Voice Assist understands commands better than the Jabra unit itself<br />7. I could check and send email and post to Twitter with VoiceAssist (Posting to Facebook is also possible.)<br />8. VoiceAssist provides SUPERB customer service.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. VoiceAssist setup was difficult and the instructions that came with the device did not tell you to program in the telephone number to VoiceAssist.  Instead the Jabra instructions tell you to call VoiceAssist making you assume it's already pre-programed in the device.<br />2. Managing your contacts online in the VoiceAssist web site is somewhat cumbersome as the tool is in its infancy. For instance, every time I edited one of my 100+ contacts it kept going back to the first one after I saved the edit--then I had to scroll through the entire list again to go back to where I wanted to in the contact list.<br />3. Answer/End button is not intuitive on the Jabra unit (it's the phone icon on the Jabra Freeway); although the instructions do tell you where it's located.<br />4. The Jabra Freeway did not always understand my voice commands  Voice Assist understood my commands much better but  that still was not perfect)<br />5. Jabra is from the UK and only an automated help line is provided along with a website.  Other than this you can send an email and wait for a response--no live support here<br /><br />In summary, although Jabra will work with any Bluetooth phone, I did not feel I could get it to work exceptionally well with the Verizon LG phone I tried it with.  I cannot be sure whether it was because of my or my boyfriend's voices (as we both tried it), the phone, or just the functionality of the device.  Despite this, the Jabra Freeway is a very sleek unit and I felt that it responded better the more familiar I got with the device.  In addition, the other reviewers are raving about the Freeway.  Although VoiceAssist was not perfect, I absolutely loved that optional add-on.<br /><br />Updated May 30, 2011 - I sent an email to Jabra with two simple questions to see how responsive their email support was and I can tell you it's great.  I sent it over the weekend and got a response this morning.  The only thing that wasn't great was that one of my simple questions was answered wrong.  I had asked where the answer/end button was and according to the manual it is the phone icon on the Jabra device; however the reponse I got was to ""Slide the On/Off power switch to turn the speakerphone on or off"" so the question was either misunderstood or the tech did not know the answer. I think it's the former.<br /><br />Updated November 7, 2011 - I recommended this to a former colleague and this is what he said about the device verbatim. ""Regarding the Jabra device, it has worked very well.  I will admit, I have not used any of the advanced features much (other than initially playing with them) as honestly I have not needed them.  It has strictly been used as a straight bluetooth device and for that purpose it has worked extremely well.  The speaker quality is above and beyond competing devices and the functionality (recognizing bluetooth connections regularly, turning off when it doesn't detect a device, etc) are features that are useful and allow it to stick out from the pack of competing devices.  Overall, it has proven useful when I needed it.""",1306629014000,417,False

Even if necessary to glance at the map.. I love its location far above any others!! Having dash level is closest to eye level- so it eliminates gazing around or looking downward and not OUT front window.. all bc phone placed within the plane of the windshield space.. it keeps eyes where they should be!!<br /><br />Would recommend for any car, especially one with a new and/or younger driver!

Connections fit snug and secure.. nothing loose or dropping signal once connected. Still offers use of phone while charging. Lightening cord boosted battery from 4% to full in just under 2hr. Ha! No dreaded “not compatible with device” error message.. no hot spots on phone or cord either- whew!<br /><br />**Discrepancy in cord length must be noted- curled cord is NOT 6ft long!! Not even close.. this is actually a 3ft. cord that runs shorter bc of curled shape.. offer same charge function but different tangle free feature at approx. 16”soft- 31” stretched. I prefer straight cord however, this is helpful in car not to let excess slack tangle- it’s 100% a personal preference! Note photo included showing folded size.. makes this easy to go mobile with you!!<br /><br />Bonus: signal light on when using car port in socket.. x2 items charge at once and tangle free cord with small footprint for travel. With x2 sets it offers use in multiple cars, or an at home/on the go option.. just keep x1 as backup if needed. Best of all- its Apple certified to be compatible and used with Apple device.

5.0,Perfect for collegiate athlete traveling every other wknd who forgets charger!!,"With a varsity collegiate athlete traveling every other wknd during season and all the joys of doing so.. she must take life on the road every other weekend. Being her 4th year of doing so.. she’s perfected the art of leaving her travel bag ready- with one outlier.. she only has x1 Apple Watch charger and it gets forgotten a lot.. making her crazy once the watch dies out!! Ha.. here in lies her salvation- simple, small and unassuming to pack up.. it attaches to keyring so, it won’t be forgotten! This has been far more then helpful- not only does she use watch for social and norm. convenience.. she tracks all physical activity, heart monitoring, stats etc. on the watch- Now, it’s “game on” (sorry, I couldn’t help it!) for continued watch use whether at home or on the go.. Awesome find!!<br /><br />Magnetic Connection feels just as secure as original charger and no lag in charge time noticed. Connects to wall butt or computer port with a snug/secure fit. Charged overnight it’s ready for use the next day.. For total transparency: she’ll use for her backup- not everyday use and it’s solid as such!<br /><br />A perfect gift for any and certainly ideal for those on the go or who travel frequently. Great idea for business travelers as well. Simple ease and convenience for having a 2nd charger meant for packing small and going with you! Easy to leave in backpack or connect to key ring- and never be lost or forgotten. All for under $10.. yay! Hoping info helps decision- stay safe everyone!",1675422446182,0,False
5.0,Perfect for those who workout in their watch..,Made with an athlete in mind.. this bands designed so it will not cause irritation to the skin while user becomes sweaty or wet! Something not all “waterproof” bands can do! Appropriate materials used allow for skin sensitivities to breathe and fully dry without creating unwanted bacteria- this is HUGE if worn at beach or during rigorous workout!! Something to keep in mind when selecting.. who is the end-user and how will it be put into action! With this brand.. you’ll be getting more than just the quality name but also it’s trusted intelligence!!<br /><br />For any familiar with orange therapy workouts- this can withstand the sweating and not feel yuck during your hour regiment.. perforated holes allow just enough breathability and used in this capacity for over a dzn. sessions- we’ve had zero adverse reaction. Rip curl is a trusted brand proven for the ocean activity and it crosses over to land just fine-<br /><br />Sized small enough for even tinier wrists- if uncertain which size.. I’d err on sizing up. Connecting to Apple Watch is easy and seamless- no issues staying put as buckle can slide into place without issue and can even be done with x1 hand!

5.0,Aesthetic’s meet protection all wrapped into one..!!,This is a great way to mix protection necessity with a trendy aesthetic! Offered in fun bright colors… and done using a thin silicone layer that is reinforced and designed to withstand impact. Case has raised lip around the camera to protect camera lenses from direct impact- this also accommodates for a protective glass over the front screen.. all without creating unnecessary bulk or exposed edges.<br /><br />Love the grab this has in the hand.. nothing slippery to easily drop! This like to cling and create a nice grip- huge when multitasking!! Easy to put into place… all buttons and commands respond as expected.

So, something to think about for your end-user. Tbh, prob not best option I’d let my teen use who always seems to be dropping the phone and a bit careless with it. But if you’re looking for something that brings a thin extra layer of protection.. this is it!

This is a must have for one who owns “the big 3” listed above!!<br /><br />Cord itself has respectable feel.. although this isn’t reinforced at any of its “vulnerable weak points..” Length is a tad short- so, must use next to wall outlet. Produces solid charge connection with all x3 devices.. It even allows a charge thru a thinner 14phone case.. fourth gen. AirPod + Apple Watch also connected no prob. I don’t see a notable change in charging speed- but, it is steady and solid.. Where this is best served is eliminating cords!<br /><br />For a price point under $20- It makes a great stocking stuffer or spoiler for any with multiple iPhone devices. So far so good!!

5.0,I must have for moms with a cell phone!!,"After using this type mechanism for the past few yrs. with my iPhone- I was recently caught without.. I found, once you’ve used and seen how helpful- it’s impossible to go backwards!! These have single-handedly saved my phone from drops that would break, fall into water.. or even from setting down and misplacing.. I truly spin it around and wear it on the outside of my hand “ring style” when hands are full of other things. It’s like the best multitasking tool for moms.. AmAziNg!!!<br /><br />These are soooo easy to use-<br />1. Find spot most comfortable for hand size and device..<br />2. clean surface of your desired location-<br />3. Peel off adhesive..<br />4. Place exactly right first try- removing to adjust hinders perf. hold!<br />5. Use away! Use until ring becomes loose or adhesive begins to lift.<br />*  Replace with backups in the set by repeating above steps.<br /><br />Such a clever and simple little gadget that has made life easier and the added benefits for keeping my phone safe has made me all the more convinced- these should be built-in to all phones!! Should be noted: I place phone in a protective case and place holder on outside. Doing so keeps phone 100% free of any adhesive etc.<br /><br />Set priced under $10- is a solid find..

5.0,Perfect on the go fix.. comes in clutch!!!,"Small in size with solid structure.. capable to fit into a standard pant pocket by size. This robust battery is incased in protection… Letting it weigh or pull down on pants- if wearing looser sweatpant or shorts! It’s NOT at all heavy.. but not paper thin like some smaller chargers might be- the trade off for ample battery boost!<br /><br />Digital display shows exact amount of charge available.. easy to read in dark/light. Two charge cord option is convenient.. Plugged in at nigh- its full the next AM. Boom- x2 outlets for charging up x2 devices at same time.. IS SO IDEAL!! No fighting with kids over who can use it first, they both can!<br /><br />Fully charged I used with husband on a flight last week- it was flawless!! Refilled both our cellphones: mine an iPhone 8+ that was at 13%- his an iPhone 14 at 23%. Refill complete in approx. 75min. and boost still had 19% left to give..!! This really does come in clutch on the go.. It saved us from landing in airport with dead devices.. This was vital bc we needed contact, reservation info. #’s, travel app for rental car, and gps to navigate the next leg of trip!!!<br /><br />So helpful and perfect for travel.. helps mama keep drained device full for kids who need it!

4.0,Does it’s job.. but doesn’t include tempered glass!!,When investing over $1k into a cell phone.. It only makes sense wanting to protect it with a solid case. $25 is a respectable price to ensure safety and not break the bank doing so.<br /><br />Corner reinforcements help protect from drop or impact.. all to safeguard the phones brain aka- motherboard!! But take note: case does NOT include front glass or camera cover.. something vital to use in unison! (x2 most common breaks on a phone and pricy to fix as well are the screen and camera.) *All x3 fit together like a puzzle as case was made to accommodate tempered glass front along with camera cover.. Reason for deducting x1 star- I feel it should mention importance of pairing case with tempered glass.. or at least offer as an option to buy all x3 pieces together as a set.<br /><br />Case slips on without issue and fits just as expected easy to maneuver in/out if needed.. beveled lip on front and back around the camera lens will also help add protection.. and act as protective edge to the glass itself.<br /><br />Overall.. as much as I want to be helpful- I’m not about to drop my phone deliberately to see how case holds up… Ha ha! I’m sure you all understand! I can say my phone fell off the seat of car and onto pavement while getting out at airport.. and not a scratch on it. I was using tempered glass over the screen/camera.. and CASEKOO phone case. Hoping info can help your decision- stay safe everyone.,1664943217737,0,False
5.0,Comes in clutch.. in the best way!!! Great option-,"LOVE this small footprint!! Truly the size of a credit card. Tbh, I was hesitant it could really step up.. yet, it surpassed all expectations. Owning older iPhone my battery life is less than ideal. But, unwilling to give up my old school 8+ just yet.. I make life work by using a power boost!! I’ve found various sizes of boosts help in diff. scenarios…<br /><br />This boost is ideal for being clutch!! It is “need ready on the go” when you are.. bc it has on/off switch! With this, you can fully charge it and turn off by power switch- then it will store its power till needed.. amazing!! Trust me, not all boost will do this (some begin to drain once unplugged!!) With this booster- I may not need it for days after I fill it up.. Ha! Only when powered on it still has 100% of boost ready to go to work.. The perfect solution to tuck into purse/backpack and have ready when you’re stuck in a bind.<br /><br />So EASY to carry.. along with small size, it weighs nothing! Won’t pull down on pockets like heavy or bulky options.. great for carrying while exercising or just running about!

When charging you will receive a flashing blue light.. this doesn’t read a % as it drains but rather has a 4 tiered light bar that drops 25% at a time as battery life drains. When empty it automatically shuts off- letting you know it’s time to refill on the charger.

We’ve come to rely on iPhones so much- truth is we may not know our destination without maps or gps, etc. We also use phone for work on the go- a solution maker for sure!<br /><br />Device is small easy to carry… Keeping with the size compatibility it’s built in cord is short!

4.0,A lifesaver in the worst of situations.. whew!!,"Now, this is convenience + a safety net that travels with you and truly takes up zero space! You don’t even have to remember to bring it along.. attach to one’s key ring- it’s always there!! A short cord with x3 charge end options that magnetically creates a circle into itself.. Attach to briefcase, backpack, purse just the same.. Anywhere you’ve been in a bind needing a charge but were missing a cord! Ha.. Welcome to the problem solver!<br /><br />Used IOS end with iPhone 8+, USB-C with iPhone 13, and standard USB with Bluetooth speaker.. All had solid connection with zero issues or any spotty disconnect. Better yet, fit is tight but not forced- no slipping to lose charge connection.<br /><br />I included up close photos- note plastic “flip slide ends” are solid and not cheap/flimsy.. not easily breakable.. Thick elastic material that covers connecting wires feels sturdy and durable. If you view pic.’s in succession.. you can see how ends function and snap + slide in/out of casing.<br /><br />Short! Cord provides just enough length to get from power source to device.. not a sliver more!! I do wish this had at least some type protection for the charge ends left exposed.. it seems necessary to keep from accidental damage.  I also wish this had a built in jump ring that was 100% secure. Although magnet circular connection is strong and seems to stay in place- peace of mind knowing it can’t fall off or undo.. is priceless.<br /><br />Overall, this is solid for $12.99 and will hopefully step up when in a bind.. after x1-2 issues (usually with travel) this should rectify future incidents.

5.0,Best I’ve ever used- and I’ve owned plenty!!,"One of the best I’ve seen! As a mom of x4, Im somehow expected to boost batteries like magic when devices runs low- and with this powerful demon.. I can do it!! This solid option holds a charge even when not in use. Battery won’t deplete just on its own- all bc it has on/off switch!<br /><br />LED screen gives real time accuracy so, it’s easy to know if/when juice is running low and time to recharge unit. WoW..!! Talk about rapid time- refilled my low battery (10% left.) in approx. 1hr. I’ve NeVeR seen a faster boost at work! (I have old fashion iPhone 8+..!!)<br /><br />Clever built in port and cord options (usb/c port)- no prob. if caught without or with the wrong one. A perk cords attach and store tightly into booster itself. NOTE: cord is short (see photos I included) so, it’s not the easiest to use/charge device at same time due to shorter length and angle. **Careful with cord itself.. it’s a “one and done” with these!! IF cord is damaged or breaks- it can’t be replaced (and we all know.. cords see plenty of wear and tear..) Deep breath: you CAN still use boost with your own cord- you just lose “all inclusive convenience.”<br /><br />Built robust-device is durable + protected. Fits standard pant pocket or into a purse/backpack with ease. *Only thing I wasn’t expecting was its weight!! My one issue with it yet, willing to overlook bc of its outstanding performance. This is small and mighty but, hefty! (small as it is- still tugs down on pant pocket by just weight alone.. something to be aware of!)<br /><br />Investing in one a substantial booster will far outlast others and perform beyond expectations. Ultimately, it pays for itself in spades! This $39 booster has it’s privileges.. worth it 100%. Hoping this info can help your decision- stay safe!",1642062014010,0,False
4.0,Great for person/family with varying electronics!!,"This has the ability to make itself very useful- especially for any who travel or are in the go a lot.. helps great with a family- with numerous devices and varying charge cords.. this does the heavy work for you! The variety of cords are actually attached to battery boost and tuck into backside nicely.. making this an all inclusive power source for when you need it most!<br /><br />Pros: cord are short and attached for ease and convenience. No need to carry excess items or worry if you have appropriate/specific charge cord. Overall device is sleek and neat. Small in size- tucks into purse, briefcase, backpack easily. Multiple units charged before battery boost itself needs to be replenished. Booster feels strong and sturdy.. no loose rattle or fragile pieces to snap off or break. Does its job- can charge a depleted battery back to full status. Power on the move is so convenient!!<br /><br />Cons: battery boost itself doesn’t come with it own charging adapter to replenish booster when power is drained. There is no way to replace the attached cord if one bends or fails over time.. and charge cords DO fail! Device isn’t able to support high speed charging cord in a port.. only standard speed- so, a bit longer to complete task.<br /><br />For price point of $39- I expect a lot from a battery boost! This items sole purpose is to help when another item is failing (am I right?!) and it should do so with an easy, mobile carrying convenience.. Facts: If needing a charge from a battery booster- it’s obviously on the go!! (Otherwise, one would just use wall plug!) So far, this has been powerful in holding a charge and easy fitting into on the go routine. This may seem a bit extra but, it best fits  any with varying devices.. Or a family that falls in that same category. With 4 kiddo’s (teen + older..) they all seem to have their preference of electronic devices yet, are good at forgetting a charge cords when out.. Ha!

4.0,X1 of the best on the market!! Best bang for your $$..!!,"For under $15 you get a solid, easy to use battery boost- complete with digitally displayed read of the amount of charge this has and you can’t beat that!!<br />This allows 2 devices to be charging at the same time which in our house is a bonus- when on the go, our phones seem to die out about the same time- so, no fighting over the recharge!! This also allows for 2 variations of USB charge cords.. a total convenience- if, your device at home use a different charge cord than the one provided with purchase.. you can eliminate the extra!<br /><br />TBH, this will replenish a depleted battery faster then any other Power boost I have owned.. (and I’ve owned close to 20 with a family of 6..!!) This little charger can take a device from less than 10% to 100% in under x45min-x1 hr.!! But, it will deplete booster a bit fast. If fully charged, this has enough power to recharge our iPhone 8+ twice before it’s pretty much spent.. I feel the perk with this is definitely in the speed at which it replenishes!<br /><br />This is slim and not overweighted- and designed about the same size/build as an iPhone 8+.. so, this can slide into ones pocket, purse or backpack no problem.<br />Overall, I recommend without hesitation- for the price, you’ll definitely get moneys worth and be happy about it.

4.0,Keeps your privacy and protects your screen!!,"This is a solid tempered glass screen Protector for iPhone 11- Only, this has an added bonus of being a privacy screen for those who want to keep information on their device safe guarded.<br />Basically, when looking straight on… The user can easily see their own information on screen. However, those around you or peering over your shoulder from an angle- don’t get that privilege..!! TBH, after a flight in close proximity with strangers- I realized the person next to me.. was 100% reading the content on my device.. Are you kidding me?!!  This eliminates those type of situations.. But, it’s not just for those without manners or, boundaries.. this is also a way to keep information safe and protect any passwords or private data you may type in or, have displayed on your screen... it really works! (which brings me to question… Why doesn’t apple build this type of safety into the original phone screen for all said reason..?! Hmm..)<br /><br />Applying this is straightforward and necessary items are included- only, my screen “cleaner wipe” was dried out- and I’ll admit.. aligning this with exact openings gave me an overall 98.9% perfect fit. Of course, it will do the job but.. if your OCD like myself- this may drive you crazy knowing that the exact notches are almost perfect but not quite.<br />so, for those two stated reasons..I deducted x1 star. Of course, One can utilize a different cleaner.. but, if the “kit” is all inclusive then it should be. And the fit- knowing it may be me being hyper critical.. and the fact, it seems to be performing its job well on both fronts- protecting my information and also, the screen on my device- I would definitely not call these deal breakers!<br />Sold as a pair at a decent price point.. I would definitely recommend and as a mom of 4 (and a husband who is a large child) I would not let a device be used without screen protection!!

3.0,The beginning to something that can only get better..,"Loving the idea of this swivel stand and wishing it could perform stronger to all it’s listed capabilities.. However, the overall structure is a bit less then, and has limitations to just be sturdy enough for the iPhone 8+..<br /><br />Best feature is the swivel base!!  If, you’re anything like our house- It is a constant sharing of something posted online with one another…this is nice to twist and turn. I’m usually the mom in the kitchen cooking.. and kids at the counter will twist this handy little number around to show me, and it’s nice to not have to touch/hold phone to see what they’re sharing.. The swivel will allow me to see keeping my “hands off” the device when this is happening! This feature will be helpful during any online learning- and what I was hoping for most.. with at home learning during quarantine, we found the watching of a lesson online was a bit obnoxious to angle toward more then, one person.. the ability to twist screen between 2.. would be helpful In this department.<br /><br />However, the base is not weighted adequately and the item can wiggle or move around on top. Not the best when holding your device.. the one thing we are looking for is something secure!<br />This does offer 2 slots for various size phones but, they do not have different widths.. translation: if your phone is in a protective case, chances are it will not fit in this holders slot at all.. this is something that definitely should be reconfigured..  The last thing I want is for kids to be constantly removing their device from the protective layer. Especially, if something is unstable it would drop without added protection. Note: A pop socket will not interfere ONLY if, it’s placed directly on the phone. The configuration of the handle allows the pop socket to stay put- (our issue is, pop socket is on our case!!)<br /><br />The back support built into this device does support an 8+ (if we take phone case off to make any of this work..) Only, I feel this needs a back support made of metal vs. Plastic. bc, I fear over multiple uses, this support will begin to lose integrity. Im not sure how long the thinner, plastic material will hold up.. as it may possibly snap off too much extra pressure!?<br /><br />Having cord storage in the base is a great idea in theory but, take note.. Most cords purchased aftermarket are made more convenient and have longer length- that will not fit. This CAN store the standard cord that is supplied with your device at purchase.. takes a little bit of patience to make it fit. If, not stored coil style nice and evenly… Otherwise, the plastic door has a struggle closing down tightly. Personally, with a support stand- I find this to be an extra that can cause more harm than good.** IF, this space was weighted with a heavy material vs. used for cord storage.. it could lend a solution to some of its shortcomings!<br /><br />Yes! You hear a bit of mechanical noise in the gear.. This wasn’t a deal breaker but, I did improve the issue. HACK: I all but fixed it with just a DOT of lubricant placed on a Q-Tip head! The tiniest amount is necessary to resolve this annoyance.<br /><br />Overall, for the Price point…which is under $10- I feel, this is not a huge investment and one could get their moneys worth, if they are aware of the few caveats and quirks this has- and adjust accordingly. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see this design continue to be perfect it because, the general idea in theory behind it is great!",1594911660431,0,False

The back appears made out of protective Crystal clear glass.. I’m loving that!! I love that you can see the actual iPhone for all its sleek and sexy lines- why buy an awesome looking phone and cover it up with bulk?!<br /><br />•The material used is 100% top grade. Trust me, I ordered two cases and the $7 alternative- looks like it..Cheap and foggy compared to this side by side. (Wish I could attach a photo to show extreme difference in material quality.) you just have to trust me on this one..<br /><br />•This had a barely bendable hardness to the case which I appreciate- a bit easier to put on the device without thinking something’s going to break.<br /><br />•Cutouts align as they should and yes!! You can use a wireless charging in this case, as long as you don’t use pop socket or ring attached to the back!!<br /><br />• Has the raised edge not only around front glass screen… But, also camera itself. Which, I feel is a must of you want to protect all THREE cameras.. um, yes please!!!<br /><br />• reinforced corners do not add any extra bulk to the case- making this barely sized bigger than the phone itself… But, giving the protection of bubble wrap-<br /><br />Hate to say it but, 2 accidental drops both, onto travertine tile from counter height… And not a scratch or crack on phone OR, case, totally shocked both drops!! That is quality and peace of mind in my book- So, if you’re looking for an item that does it’s job for a decent $ and looks good doing it... this is the case for you!!<br /><br />Hope this info helps..  feel free to let me know!",1587331895859,0,False

5.0,Solid IPhone 8+ case.. sturdy and does it’s job well!!,"Straightforward, strong and sturdy iphone case for the iPhone 8 plus. Due to the age of iPhone, this size model is harder to get your hands on… Making me all the more impressed to see the Kit Me Out World case is rock-solid!!<br /><br />This is a little stubborn to get on as it doesn’t have a lot of bend.. Honest, it gives me confidence in the tightness of the overall fit… I’ve used other cases in the past that almost appear “too loose“ from the start- Although this is a rubberized plastic, it basically offers very little bend.. giving just enough to snap into position- i’m guessing over time this will wear and have more give. just note: this may be a bit difficult for any who like to swap cases often. Me personally, I like to lock and load… Only replacing when necessary!<br /><br />This case provides the raised edges that are a must for screen protection and with a slightly higher rounded edge it is capable to protect the actual glass on both, front/back from a full frontal drop!!<br />Cutouts align nicely and charging cord can slip in/out without any resistance- This feels firm in overall corner structure as well- this has a rounded bumper style protection.. Overall, the case provides the needed security and does so, without creating unnecessary bulk- this case also allows for cordless charging as well.. no need to take off case, as long as no pop socket/ring is used on the back!!<br /><br />Would recommend an order again. Personally I chose Crystal clear with black edging. I appreciate the ability to visually see the phone and this case lets you keep the integrity of the look but, provides protection of your investment.. win/win!!<br /><br />I hope this info helps… Feel free to let me know!",1584837659357,0,False
3.0,Double check 11/11 pro.. I ordered one and got the other!!,"Ohh, how I wanted and needed this to be accurate!!<br />I ordered the day my husband received his new iPhone device…and wanted to protect right out of the box. However, product stated iPhone 11- yet, when it arrived- it’s actually said for the 11 Pro..!! **So, pay attention to specific/exact measurements with these products and do not just order off of the name/wording!! (I included a photo with the discrepancy- hopefully it can be easily fixed and keep someone else from my same issue.. If you look you see- it states compatible with iphone11.. and 2nd line states iphone11pro. Problem = the 2 devices are diff. in size and by approximately 4mm. In the end, try as we might we looked like “Cinderella’s stepsister trying time make the slipper fit!” and had a good laugh!!<br /><br />As far as examination of the product- it appears straightforward and no nonsense, no whistle‘s… No bells… Just how my husband prefers a case (easy in/out of pocket.. no pattern or, dangles!) Our order was for crystal clear colorless case and thats what this is 100%! It came with insert of protective foam, keeping it safe from scratches.. a cleaning pad to wipe down prior to applying is a nice perk. Honest, when you buy a phone that in itself is sexy.. you want to show it off. This is a nice way to protect and still enjoy the look of the iPhone.<br /><br />Corners appear to be most protected/reinforced.. And due to the fact- corners usually take the brunt of a fall.. I find this a must have!! The added feature of a raised edge around camera (ok, 3 cameras!) is great- anything to help protect without giving bulk.. is a great feature for me!!<br /><br />Unfortunately, how well it performs on the device.. I cannot contribute due to advertising error!!<br /><br />But, If looking for a no frills, straightforward case that is soft/pliable but, at same time stiff/sturdy.. and made of a clear scratch free plastic- This Seems like a great find in a case and the fact it is offered at a fair price. win win win..!!!<br />I hoped this info. helped… Feel free to say so!",1584419718841,1,False
3.0,Great in theory- just too light and unstable.,"Great in theory.. But, the product itself is too light weight and low profile… I had a hard time putting the device of choice on the stand and having it be stable. This has all the creature comforts and construction a stand of this nature should have in order to work.. it feels as if it’s lacking the “meat” or, integrity to feel stable (If that makes sense?!!)<br />It does say “phone stand” and I was trying to balance an Android mini G pad (which is only 1x1 bigger then, I phone and no such luck!)<br /><br />Now, the iPhone 8+.. definitely did better and yesss!!! This 100% should only be used with smaller devices- However, as I was trying to prop iPhone in place- the stand was sliding each attempt and this was on my solid kitchen surface.. The equilibrium compatibility of the two items is bit of a struggle to get together. My iphone ringer is also set to vibrate- and when a call came in.. the phone fell sideways out of the holder (if that gives you an indication of stability?!)<br /><br /> TBH, when this arrived… I wasn’t even sure what it was coming out of the package! So, It does fold up very compact and as probably assumed post my issues listed above… This is very light weight. Placed inside a bag or backpack, one would not even know it was there! Because it’s made of plastic with a few moving parts…It does have the capability to snap or, break- (be careful not to Get it sandwiched in between heavy books!!)<br /><br />Bottom line, there are better options for this type accessories that are more stable and comparable in price. This needs a few tweaks to stabilize before it would meet the basic expectations..",1576958957330,0,False
5.0,Best invention ever- Should be standard on devices,"The best invention since sliced bread… I don’t understand why a cell phone doesn’t come equipped with this type of handle built-in? For the mom of four kids who is constantly multitasking and doing so, with 62.5 Things in her hand at any given time… I love that I can hook this to my finger and not worry about dropping or, can even use as handle to carry while carrying other items as well!!<br /><br />This is straightforward to put on and can be placed directly onto the cell phone back… I didn’t choose to do that as I didn’t want gummy residue left on my actual iPhone. Nor, did I want my iPhone naked and not protected without a case - So, I put this on the outside of my case and it went on without any issue.<br /><br />I know this can be used as a stand to prop your device and watch video. Although I do not use it in this capacity… It is an added feature or bonus!<br /><br />The stick is pretty immediate so, take the time to make sure it’s straight and in your appropriate range to feel comfortable when holding phone. For my hand size… The actual placement is directly in the middle and slightly longer than halfway in center of the phone. Before taking the sticker off, put ring on middle finger and align to a comfortable fit- and mark it! this is the best way to ensure you get the appropriate placement.<br /><br />One way to improve this product- Would be to include a “card stock template square” such as a (3x4)?. Something with straight edges and having a cutout into the middle- of the ring adhesive shape and size.. that way, it could be used to align the item exactly straight when placing the semi permanent adhesive onto the actual device.<br />If a straight edged of a template could easily align with at least x1 side of any said devices edge..<br /><br />Overall, these are worth their weight in gold. They do not take away from the overall look of the case. The clear adhesive makes only the metal ring stand out. Definitely a must have in my opinion as it has save me from dropping my phone and causing damage more times than I could ever count!",1573136572818,2,False
5.0,Best invention ever made.. EVER!!,"I’m in love!! I have to admit- in the past I’ve been using the case with the phone ring built in- as I felt it was safer in the fact, the ring was not going to let loose and ultimately make me drop the phone.. However, I must have smaller hands as, the ring was placed far too high in middle of the phone and was not comfortable at all. The stretch my hands had to try and do was a joke..<br />This is when I decided to try a regular phone case and Adhere my own ring onto the back- Wow!  What a difference it made. When you can choose the placement of the ring… It is actually comfortable, useful and I have never had any problem with adhesive coming loose. In fact, it’s quite the opposite… If you use a ring adhesive on a phone case -be prepared for it to be there for life! Or, at least some residue of it!<br />Being a mom who’s always on the go with x4 kids, a mom who needs to constantly have a phone in hand- this ring is the best invention ever made and a universal life saver. I do know it can be used as a phone stand.. and I’ve had that purpose tried by kids needing entertainment “TV” style. But, I like the fact that in a pinch.. you can be the totally lame mom and spin the phone on the outer side of your hand (like an obnoxious ring!!!) and actually utilize your hands to carry or multitask and trust me-  no matter how much you don’t want to be that person… With this feature, eventually you’ll use it and see how helpful it can be! I made it thru the airport this way- never once having to search or ask- “where in the world did I set my phone..?” the words I may have engraved on my tombstone (no, I’m not proud.. but, it is so fitting these days!)<br /><br />So, if you’re wanting to have the ease of using your phone, carrying it with you and when needed, utilizing the ring to simplify the multi-tasking.. this is a must get. Don’t hesitate about the safety- as the adhesion sticks and does the trick.. you can even hook the ring on any small odd object that pokes out- and that has been just an extra perk I’ve found while using..**life hack: I hang the ring on a cupboard handle when following an online recipe. Boom! The phone hangs perfect at my eye level and makes it so easy to follow along.. but, hands down the best part of having this feature- is the ability to be hands free as needed. All while keeping phone on back side of your hand! And if you’re ever not needing to use the ring- it fold down on itself so, the phone can still slide easily into the back pocket. **note that wireless chargers usually don’t work with this attachment on the back of the phone- it’s placement must be about the same spot as the wireless signal for the battery charging- I point that out, in case it’s a deal breaker for any of you...?!<br /><br />This is simple to put on- but, I suggest before exposing the glue strip.. put your ring on hand as you would use it.. and set phone on top (that way you can move the phone around to different positions.. till you find spot that feels most comfortable.) Then, before you move it to expose the glue strip- just mark the back with a tiny mark/dot.. and this will insure its placed where YOU want it! From there, you just follow the easy step/step instructions.. and that’s it!",1565250530703,0,False

I had no problem with sliding the two pieces apart- you should read the brief instructions that come with it, which basically tells you to press down on the centre of the lower half and then pull!

The whole phone clicks in and out very smoothly.  The fact that the rubber sleeve covers the 'death grip' position on the phone, there is no interference at all on the signal.  Impressed.

4.0,For ITOUCH ONLY and needs another $50 to buy the software,"This application really helps to consolidate the use of the itouch that we use a lot for general map reading.  However, this is not cheap and you have to factor in another $50 to buy the software before you can even use it.  That was a slight downer as at that price, it could have come with a basic program.<br /><br />the software was easy to install and once itouch was clipped into the kit, we did not find it had any more problems in picking up a signal than our tomtom.  At least, it is one less piece of gadget to carry around with us.  It was easy to use and we would replace the tomtom once that breaks down.  if you have an itouch and is also considering a tomtom/other gps device then I can recommend that you just buy this along with the additional software.<br /><br />The attachment offers two methods: suction pad to your window screen or a sticky pad if you want the placement on a more permanent surface in your car.

1.0,Not For Me,"I have tried a great many phone holders for activity. The arm band kind never work for me. The belt kind work, but then your phone isn’t accessible, so if you’re using certain apps, it can be difficult with the belt. So, this one works similar to a handheld water bottle. You strap it to your hand with your thumb through the loop. Seems simple.<br />First problem, the phone portion is going to be hard. Like, that side won’t wrap or mold around your hand. I know you are used to holding your phone all day, but for some reason, it was just awkward in this case and didn’t let the case fit the hand very well.<br />Second problem is that the band around the back of your hand is not stretchy. So you can’t get it very tight. The material is a weird neoprene type thing, which is good for not letting your sweat get all over the phone, but the fit is just bad.<br />Third problem is that the band around the back of your hand is the length of you phone. So, for me, with small hands, the back just won’t fit very securely. With the thumb loop, you can keep the phone in your hand, but I hand to hold it more than I like for an activity phone holder.<br />Fourth problem is the plastic sits on my phone screen really oddly. It makes viewing the screen really difficult because it bubbles and sticks to the screen. Now, I have an Essential phone and it barely fits in this case. So, maybe that is what makes the plastic over the screen weird.<br />I normally don’t have a problem wearing an in hand water bottle, but for some reason this just didn’t feel at all natural.

5.0,Almost Perfect,"First, let me say that I am not a techie. I'm just a normal person who just needs easy to use electronics that work. Very simple. This is my last ditch effort to like an Android phone. I've had three or four Android phones now and none of them have been very impressive.<br />The box arrived and it made me nervous. I opened it and there were no paper instructions. So I hid the box for a few days until I got some quite time to sit and figure it out. Turns out, that wasn't really necessary. It was super simple. Push the power button and it walks you through the entire set up. I didn't even have to call my cell phone provider to switch to the phone. Just popped the SIM card out of one phone and put it in the other. Easy. The phone held my hand and walked me through each step.<br />The screen is impressive. Pictures look so crisp and pretty. The colors are so vivid and I love the to-the-edge image.<br />I really like the fingerprint scanner being on the back. The thumb scanner on the front has never made sense to me. It isnt' a natural way to hold a phone. With this one, the way you naturally pick up the phone unlocks it.<br />The size is great. It isn't so small that I have trouble typing. But not so huge it is awkward.<br />It runs really well. The camera isn't great on it, but you can upgrade it.<br />It has no headphone jack. It does come with an adaptor, but I still have issue with it. Mainly, use in the car. I like to be able to plug my phone in to charge and plug the auxiliary cord in at the same time to run music for the kids while not draining my battery. Now, I have to decide which one I want to do AND I have to make sure I have the adaptor. I know phones are moving away from the auxiliary port, but I hate that they are. It does work with Bluetooth headphones that I have.<br />The finish on it isn't ideal. It is just really shiny all over, so it makes fingerprint smudges all over the phone. A case would easily solve the problem, but since this is a new product, cover options are awfully slim at the moment.<br />Overall, I actually like the phone, which is more than I can say for my previous Android devices. It works well and easily. It has lots of storage. So, the pluses outweigh the negatives for me.",1505672675115,2,False
5.0,Charges for Everyone!,"This is a cigarette lighter style plug. So, if you have the USB type plug already in your car, this isn't going to work. The one end plugs into the cigarette lighter (what do they even call those these days?) and then it has a longish cord and more USB plugs on the other end.

It does reach the bench right behind the driver, but no further than that. (Sorry to those on the back two rows.) You can plug up to 5 devices in at a time. With all 5 plugged in, charging is a bit slower. It does better with only one or two things plugged in. But if everything is dying all at once, plugging everything in is an option and it does charge them, just not quite as fast. In a normal size car, you would be able to plug your device or two in up front and then let the backseat passengers use the other end to plug in their devices. In an SUV or minivan, you can reach the middle row of seats, but the far back row would be a bit of a stretch, but could likely be done.",1502988674152,0,False

5.0,"It's not Completely Perfect, but I Love this Cover","Perhaps the greatest compliment this case has gotten was from the three people who said ""You should get a case to protect your phone.""  To which I point out that it already has one.  It just fits so elegantly on the phone that it just seems to be part of the phone.  The way the buttoms are covered with rubberized covers makes the case seem like the phone itself.  The buttons seem to work perfectly fine through the case.  Also the camera and flash seem well protected in their little recessed area. It's not bulky but seems quite protective.<br /><br />The case fits my phone perfectly and firmly.  There is a little strangeness about it's feel in your hand.  There are some kind of sharp edges.  Not cut your finger sharp, but feel funny in your hand sharp.  I've gotten used to it, but it is not a smootly rounded, ergonomic feel.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Great Looks.<br />- Button Covers work Great and give the feel that there is no cover<br />- It has a nice solid feel to it<br /><br />Cons<br />- Back Scratches easily (but at least it's not my phone)<br />- Does not come with a screen protector film.<br />- Edges have sharp right angles which make it feel a little less than ergonomic (not a big thing)<br /><br />Summary<br />I have recommended this cover to friends and co-workers.

I consistently only got a bar or two except for one spot in the house. This device made an immediate improvement. I don't get full bars, but it's enough to take calls and have people be able to actually hear me. If you should happen to need to contact customer service, they're excellent and very patient.

5.0,Decent Flap Case for iPhone 13,"I had a case similar to this one for my iPhone 6 and I really came to appreciate it. It was convenient to have the necessary cards with my phone without having to carry a separate wallet. I wanted a similar case for my iPhone 13 and I found this one. It's not perfect but it answers the need I have and I am happy with it.<br /><br />This is a basic flap case with three card holder and one ID holder. It does add a little bulk to the phone when the phone is in it, but it still fits nicely in my pocket. Contact magnets keep the flap closed so nothing shakes loose.<br /><br />One of the features this case claims is RFID protection. I decided to test that on the card readers at work, which are very sensitive and can read my badge from over a foot away. With my badge in this case the reader could still scan it, but it had to be about 2"" from the sensor before it would pick up. That's on par with the large majority of RFID wallets I have tried. I have seen better, but I have also seen worse. For most people, this is sufficient protection for preventing scans from any practical distance.<br /><br />The case seems to be made well and I haven't noticed any problems with the material separating or being assembled incorrectly. Time will tell how well it holds up.<br /><br />The one area where I think this case could use some improvement is in the number of card pockets. It can hold only a total of 4 credit cards (or 3 + 1 ID card). That may be enough for some, but I need a couple more slots. Adding more would cause the case to add much more bulk, and the flap would not close either, so this is probably as close to perfect as I will find.<br /><br />As I write this, the asking price is about $20, which is reasonable.<br /><br />This is the type of phone case I wanted and it meets the need I have. It looks nice, it holds a few cards for me so I don't need to pack a separate wallet, and it offers basic RFID protection for those cards. The asking price is reasonable too. If you have an iPhone 13 and you want a case that can hold a couple of credit cards, this is one to consider.",1675854115541,1,False
5.0,Solid Basic Phone Case,"It has been a while since I have had an Otterbox phone case. I recently upgraded my phone and wanted a basic clear case for it, and I chose this one. So far I am happy with it.<br /><br />This is a basic, no-frills case for the iPhone 13. As mentioned I chose the clear case and it is very much that - it is not frosted or opaque like another case I have but is absolutely clear.<br /><br />The case is designed for bumper shocks more than anything and it delivers. It has a thick, semi-pliable bumper guard as well as a fair amount of thickness on the back so your phone is well protected. It does a good job with medium height drops and fumbles and it keeps the phone for getting scratched up when jammed in a pocket of briefcase.<br /><br />The button covers work well and the phone is as operable as if I put no case on it at all. I have had no issues with unresponsive buttons related to this case. The speaker, microphone and lightning ports all line up nicely on the bottom as well and the case does not interfere with any of these. Finally, the case comes to the perimeter of the screen but does not actually touch the screen so it does not interfere with screen covers - I major issue I have seen with a few cheap cases in the past.<br /><br />I am pleased with this case and expect to get years of service from it. It provides good protection for the phone and it does not interfere with the phone's operation at all.",1659348786315,0,False
5.0,"Fine Battery Pack, Works Well","I have worked with several power banks similar to this one and I have seen them come with a lot of features that may or may not be useful. This one sticks fairly closely to the basics and it gets things right.<br /><br />This is a 20k mA bank and it can change a phone repeatedly between needing to be charged itself. It has two Type A USB output ports (QC) and one Type C in/out USB port, and it is capable of outputting on all three ports simultaneously. It's small enough to pack in a briefcase or backpack, though it is heavly and bulky enough that it is a little unwieldy in a pocket.<br /><br />The display is nice and bright and shows the remaining charge capacity.<br /><br />It does have an emergeny light that can be turned on and off, and I have seen this type of feature on other banks and have found it to be less than useful most of the time. That said, if you need an emergency light source (albeit a relatively dim one) it is available.<br /><br />The charging speeds are impressive - if the receiving device can handle the speeds. Most devices I have worked with are limited by their own onboard ports and not the device sending the power. If you have a device that can handle a QC input or charges via USB-C, this bank does well. If not, this bank will still charge it but cannot charge it as quickly (in other words, it scales properly).<br /><br />It comes with a nice mesh pouch for carrying and storage.<br /><br />So far, I have no complaints with this power bank. It works well and has a generous power storage capacity. Being able to charge via USB-C is a big plus if you have a device that can handle the speed.",1648550350710,0,False
5.0,Everything You need in the Package; Priced Very Well,"I recently got a new phone after carrying my old one around for years, and I needed a case and screen protectors for it as well. I selected these because they were readily available to me, and I have been pleased with them so far.<br /><br />These are relatively simple and straightforward screen protectors - nothing fancy and nothing special about them when compared to some other options. The kit is fairly complete too - in addition to the screen protectors, it includes the alcohol and dry wipes, a microfiber wipe, and of course instructions. These are easy to install and when the surface is prepared properly they go on without too much fanfare - I got the first one right on the first try without bubbles and without particles caught underneath.<br /><br />Theses are nothing fancy but they don't need to be. They are no-frills, they attach easily and the package has everything you need. The asking price is very reasonable too.",1648548428168,0,False
5.0,Decent Budget Case for iPhone 13,"I selected this case for a new iPhone 13. I wanted a case that fit snugly and that provided decent protection for my phone. So far I'm pleased with it.<br /><br />This is a very simple case, providing basic protection. It has softer bumpers on the sides to protect against corner drops and the back is more rigid. While the sides are clear, the back is frosted which softens the appearance of the phone though the Apple logo is still plainly visible and discernable.<br /><br />The case is a very snug fit. It requires a bit of effort to get the phone to snap into it, and once in there's little play between the edges of the case and the phone. This is not a case where the phone will slip out of the case in your pocket and there will be appreciably less dirt in the case as compared to more relaxed-fit cases.<br /><br />The jury is out on how much protection it provides, but it seems to be decent, particularly for the cost. I like this case and prefer it over a more expensive case I have for my phone.",1646739161580,0,False
4.0,High Capacity at a Great Price Point; Slow to Replenish,"I use battery packs like this one to charge my phone all the time; I’ve learned that plugging my phone into the wall and letting it charge continuously shortens the battery life, while a battery pack cuts off when the charge is finished. This is the highest capacity charger I have seen and used and so far I am happy with it, though I do have one complaint with it.<br /><br />Most packs I have used top out around 10,000mA (some have been higher) and are good enough to charge my phone 3-4 times before needing to be plugged in to replenish. This one is 30,000mA and I believe I can get around 10-12 charges from it before I need to plug it in and charge it back up. That’s a huge difference. I say “believe” because I have not drained it all the way to nothing yet, but so far that seems to be about right.<br /><br />This thing has a good-sized solar cell and it helps in keeping the charge up. That said, do not expect it to charge at the same rate via solar cell as it does when it’s plugged in. On average I have noticed most solar packs take roughly 4 times longer to charge with just solar as compared to using USB.<br /><br />This unit plugs in via USB-C for charging and this is faster than using MicroUSB. Now that said, this is not a fast-charging device, at least when replenishing the pack. When I received it I immediately plugged it in and it showed it was roughly half charged. It took several hours to reach full capacity. Using the port to charge a tablet the charge speed it fine, though. Being a larger pack it will obviously take longer to charge up than a smaller one, but I was surprised at how long the charge takes, considering the USB-C charging port. Fortunately I have not needed to charge it from empty yet.<br /><br />Included is an LED flashlight bank that is good for emergency use. I don’t make a habit of using such, but it’s a nice-to-have.<br /><br />One word of caution I offer if you have used other cells like this one – this one is heavier than is typical, which is a function of the capacity due to bigger battery storage. If traveling light is more important than having battery power, this is something to keep in mind. The include carabiner is very helpful and allows for clipping this pack to a backpack, belt or other otherwise unused loop or hook.<br /><br />The price is the big bonus with this pack. I have seen packs that cost more that have less features and less capacity, so this pack is a bargain considering the price point.<br /><br />Other than the slow recharge, this is a great pack that will see a lot of use in my house. I love the capacity and I like that I can leave it on the window sill to keep charging when not in use. The price point is excellent, considering the capacity. If you need capacity and the weight isn’t a concern, this is one to definitely consider.",1622115711668,0,False
5.0,Solid Vent-Based Mounting System,"I go through phone mounts for the car at a rate of about one every year. My preference in mounts is actually vent mounts because the AC coming out of the vent keeps the phone cooler (I have had problems with the phone overheating in the car on occasion and mounting over the vent helps tremendously). I have used other Andobil phone mounts and looked to this one to fill the need since my last mount broke. So far I’m pleased with it.<br /><br />This mount is a typical ball/socket mount for the vent, but there are two different vent attachments for it. One is a typical pincer-type that grips via rubber-padded fins that work somewhat like disk brakes. The other is a type I have never before seen and works by a retractable hook designed to hold tight against the back of the vent fin, without a friction grip.<br /><br />The pincer grip works about as expected. It has a wingnut-style tightener that slowly closes the fins together until they form a good, firm grip on one of the fins in the vent. If you haven’t worked with this type of mount, I offer a word of caution from experience – do not overtighten, because enough tension will cause the fins to crack and break which ruins the mount.<br /><br />The other mount works on a worm gear style of mechanism (if it’s not a worm gear, it works like one). A turning sleeve slowly retracts the hooked arm until it catches and holds snugly against the vent. It has a couple of splayed feet that provide support against either the rest of the vent or the dashboard depending on how it is positioned.<br /><br />From experience with other Andobil mounts, I would recommend putting a drop of lubricating oil on the ball to help prevent the socket from seizing. The rubber gasket in the socket has a tendency to stick to the ball, which is an issue if you want to make an adjustment to the position.<br /><br />The holding bracket for the phone itself is well designed. Some brackets snap open abruptly when opened, but this one opens gently which produces less wear and tear on the inner workings. It accommodates my phone just fine (an older iPhone 6) but it also is large enough to handle larger models without difficulty. The bracket holds securely and I have had no problem with my phone shifting or slipping, even when I have slapped my phone in hastily without paying attention.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice vent mount for the phone. It holds well and it has a different mounting mechanism that seems to work better than the normal pincer type, though it comes with a pincer mount too if that is preferred. If you like vent mounts for the phone (and in my case, such is my very best option), this is one to consider.",1620481073746,0,False
5.0,Works Well and Competitively Priced,"I selected this phone mounting system specifically because it comes with a vent mount and I have had problems with my phone getting too hot on the dashboard. The one I had been using broke and could not be repaired so I needed a new one, and this one seemed like a reasonable solution. So far, I am very pleased with it. It seems to be well-made and it holds the phone very well. The cost is a plus as well.<br /><br />There are two ways to mount your phone with this unit – either using the suction mount or with the ventilation mount. Most people will probably use the suction mount, and as far as that goes the suction mount is better than many I have used. The suction cup itself is one of the sticky types that gives it additional adhesion to smooth surfaces, a huge plus when mounting on the windshield. Because of the stickiness, it is a lot less likely to release when the window gets cold in the wintertime. The vent mount is very typical and is a basic pincer mechanism that uses a wingnut/screw to tighten. The good news is that you don’t have to choose just one or the other because the ball and socket connector allows for moving the actual harness between the two. So, if you have two vehicles, you only need one unit without needing to move the whole thing and you can leave the suction cup in place.<br /><br />The harness itself works like a standard car mount solution – drop in the phone and squeeze the sides together against the phone. Press a button to make it let go of the phone. Adjust the bottom support bracket for larger phones. This is not rocket science. What is different, though, is that the release is more of a soft mechanism instead of an abrupt open that slams immediately to completely open. When the release button is pressed the harness opens gently. That will reduce stress and wear, though I never had a problem with any harness breaking in the past because of this.<br /><br />I put the phone in the harness, closed the harness snugly and then inverted the whole thing and shook it very vigorously. The phone didn’t come out and didn’t even wiggle. That’s a very good sign that the harness won’t accidentally let your phone fall if secured properly. While not a road/vibration test, it is more than enough to make the point that this harness will keep your phone secure.<br /><br />Finally, there’s the cost. I have seen a lot of harnesses that are of lower quality that cost more and don’t come with the ventilation mount. This one is priced competitively.<br /><br />So far I have zero complaints. I am not a typical user in that I favor the ventilation mount, though the suction mount is well made and will keep your phone secured. The harness is above average and does a very good job of holding the phone in place. And finally, the asking price is very reasonable.",1595093025107,9,False
5.0,Exceeded My Expectations,"I have used a number of different phone holders of different types, but this is the first one I have used that is mounted on the air vent. I have avoided this type of holder up to this point because I did not trust that they would hold well or would constantly force the vent to point downward from the weight of the holder. Summer is upon us, and I have had repeated problems with my phone overheating and shutting down so I decided to try this holder to see if it would help with that problem specifically. Now I wish I had been using this type of holder all along; it has proven to be far and away better than I expected.<br /><br />I will start by saying that my concerns with this type of holder seem to be unfounded. The holder does keep the vent open which is ok, and there is a little bit of play in the vent itself in terms of being able to move the fins, but the holder stays put and when attached properly it holds securely.<br /><br />Most spring-loaded holders with which I have worked use a spring to clamp closed on the devices they hold, but this one works in the opposite way. To close, the clamp must be manually closed and squeezed against the phone to secure the phone, and the button on the holder causes the clamp to pop open. This isn't a problem, it's just different than what I have seen before now.<br /><br />So, with the temperature close to 100 F in the car, I clamped the phone in place and cranked up the AC. I made two important observations. First, the holder was not as disruptive to air flow as I had thought it would be. Yes, it does block a good bit of air from direct flow but it does not close the vent or keep air from flowing, so it did not impact how well the car's AC worked. Second, even with the sun beating down on the phone, the phone was cooled enough by the AC to be cool to the touch and it never shut down on me.<br /><br />This phone holder solved an important issue for me and cleared up some of the misunderstandings I had about air vent mounts. It works well for me and it allows me to keep my phone alive when other solutions failed me. This is an easy product to recommend based on my experience with it.",1563447379635,0,False
5.0,Works Well,"I have worked with a number of power banks like this one, and all of them are similar in concept and basic function though they vary in capacity, number of ports, included accessories like carabiners and other features. This is one of the larger-capacity packs with which I have worked and so far I have not had any issues with it. It appears to be a solid workhorse.<br /><br />At the heart of any of these battery packs is a set of rechargeable batteries, which is where these things get their weight. Generally speaking, the heavier the power bank the more batteries and more capacity the bank possesses. This one is no exception to that. At a capacity of 25,000 mA, this is a bit of a brute and has some heft to it. That said, it is slightly smaller and lighter than most of the higher-capacity units I have used.<br /><br />It’s a handsome fellow and looks quite a bit like a smart phone.<br /><br />There are two output ports for charging USB devices. One of them is rated for 5V/1A and the other is at 5V/2.1A. This does not mean that when you plug in a tablet or phone that it will steadily output a full 1A or 2.1A. Putting a USB power meter on the ports when charging my phone on the 1A port, the power fluctuates, especially if I am actually doing things on my phone at the time. When “at rest”, my phone typically draws about 0.5A, but when I open an app or open a web page in the browser, it spikes and will pull quite a bit more but then it settles again.<br /><br />I have not drained this pack completely yet so I am not sure how many charges I can get with it when it comes to my phone. My phone can be charged from dead to 100% on a pack that has a 2,500 mA capacity, so in theory this one should be capable of giving me 10 full charges between needing to be recharged itself. We’ll see. It does get my phone charged up relatively quickly, and it shows its own capacity while it is charging so I’ll know when it is getting low.<br /><br />So far, I have no complaints with this battery pack and I am pleased with it. It looks nice, it has a very high capacity and it works as advertised.",1554883573342,0,False
5.0,Work as Expected,"With a couple of iPhones in the house I am always trying to track down lightning cables. I selected these in the hopes that they would be a viable alternative to buying Apple-branded cables. My concern with these cables is that the listing says nothing about MFi certification, so there is no guarantee that the cables will work properly. As it turns out, they work just fine, and the colors make the different cables easy to tell apart (for those of us that have color preferences).<br /><br />Without any indication of certification, I wasn’t sure if these cables would work at all, though most uncertified cables I have seen and used have at least permitted the phone to be charged. Only one way to find out – I plugged my phone into my computer using one of the cables. My phone immediately started charging and my computer was able to access the storage in my phone. That’s really all there is to it, they work.<br /><br />The cable is shielded in a nylon weave and is terminated on both ends with a hard plastic plug with a sleeve before capping in an aluminum casing. They seem to be made well and hopefully should last a while.<br /><br />The price is good, too, considerably cheaper than Apple-branded cables.<br /><br />So far, I have no complaints with these cables. They work like they’re supposed to work in spite of no certification statement, they’re inexpensive and they seem to be made well.",1554426397179,1,False
4.0,"Good Lens, Clip is Passable","I have worked with a number of lenses for phones and I have seen some interesting variations. Some require a special case to work with a phone (and therefore are model-specific) while others use a special clip that clamps over the phone’s lens. This one falls into the latter design type and for what it is it’s very good, though there is room for a little improvement.<br /><br />There are two main components to this lens. There is the clip to which the lens attaches, and there is the lens itself which is actually a pair of lenses. The clip is a solid and sturdy thing with a strong grip so I will not slip off the phone when in use, a problem I have seen with lenses of this type on occasion. The part that touches the back of the phone has a thin foam pad that provides grip, and the pad has a slight swivel action to it so in theory it will lay flat regardless of the phone’s shape. It works in that regard, even with the phone case on.<br /><br />Now, that said, to get this lens to really work I have to take my phone out of its case. That’s inconvenient but not a deal breaker for me because my phone case is a simple slip-on case. For those using a more complex case it may prove to be more tedious. There are things that could have been done to make it fit regardless of the case.<br /><br />The lens itself is a two-piece assembly, as many are. When assembled it is a wide-angle lens that enhances the field of view in the shot, especially when zoomed out. When only the base is used, it is a high-magnification macro lens that is great for taking clear pics of things that are very close. In both cases, I have found the images to come out with very little distortion and the images are clear and sharp. For the macro lens test I used my thumb as a test subject and I was able to get good ridge detail on my thumb print.<br /><br />The lens includes a nice cloth bag that keeps it clean and protects it from scratches. It’s not much protection against crush damage when the lens is stored in a book bag but it’s certainly better than nothing and will keep the lens mostly pristine when on the go.<br /><br />This is a good lens, let down by a basic clamp that could have been better. If you don’t mind taking your phone out of the case to use this lens, the lens will serve you well and you’ll be rewarded with solid, clear pics.",1549111261058,0,False
5.0,"Strong Suction Cup, Easy to Adjust","I selected this windshield mount to hold a GPS navigator as the suction cup that came with the navigator is weak and has a bad tendency to let go unexpectedly. So far it is working well for me, though admittedly I have not had it very long so there hasn’t been a lot of wear and tear on it yet.<br /><br />The main feature of this mount is definitely the suction cup. It’s super-sticky and it holds even when the temperature outside drops below freezing. Most regular suction cups have a bad tendency to lose suction and release when it gets cold, usually at the most inconvenient of times. I don’t know how cold it has to get before this one will let go, but it’s definitely a lower temperature than a typical dry suction cup.<br /><br />The bracket that holds the phone (or in my case the GPS) is designed to be worked with one hand and it works well. It opens easily and snaps closed when a phone is pressed into the bracket. The problem I have had with other brackets like this one is that the foam grips on the brackets have come out and get lost; hopefully this one will not have the same issue, and so far it hasn’t been a problem.<br /><br />I like the versatility in adjustments that can be made to get the position right. The arm telescopes out and the height can be positioned just right to either get it out of the way or to put it precisely where it needs to be so it’s easily accessible. A word of caution, though – when mounting to the windshield, take care to put the suction cup exactly where you want it, because once it’s placed it takes some deliberate effort to move it again. Typical suction cups are much easier to move and often can be shifted with one hand; don’t try that with this mount. The only additional adjustment that would make this mount even better would be to have the base on a swivel so the mount can be easily turned. I haven’t seen any mounts like that so far.<br /><br />So far I’m happy with this mount. It seems to be holding up well and the suction cup is nice and strong. It’s a bit difficult to move once it is mounted though this is one of its strengths. It has other adjustments that make is versatile enough to have limited movement once attached, and getting your device in and out of it is easy. This is easy to recommend based on my experience with it so far.",1546338662397,6,False
5.0,Best Smartwatch I Have Used So Far!,"Many people do not wear watches anymore, as a cell phone is a quick way to get accurate time without consulting a separate time piece that itself requires maintenance. A cell phone is not always convenient to carry though, and personally I prefer wearing an actual watch. This is the first smart watch I have used that I really like, and though I have barely tapped the potential of it I am very pleased with what it does for me so far.<br /><br />I will start with a comment about the company: I have seen very, very consistent quality with ASUS, and for some reason their products are generally more affordable than other big names. Because of the name, I expected (and got) quality right out of the box.<br /><br />This is a very nondescript watch right out of the box. It is very plain-looking and the leather band, while nice, does not stand out for either good or bad reasons. Overall, it is very basic-looking and dull – until you turn it on and start interacting with it, and then it comes into its own.<br /><br />Getting the watch to work properly really requires a Bluetooth-enabled device running either iOS or Android. The application Android Wear is in the store for both operating systems. Note that this means that Windows users are just out of luck. In addition to sending a time sync to the watch, it also allows for setting reminders and alarms as well as mail and voice integration.<br /><br />This particular smart watch has a feature that, to me, makes it worth having in that the face can be changed very easily and quickly. There is a selection of many, many watch faces and it is a snap to change the appearance – just select a face, wait a moment and the face changes to the selection without any fuss. So, if you need something fancy you can set it to that and set it to something more casual later.<br /><br />It has some other settings and functions too, though I have not yet learned how to use and/or access them all. It does keep track of my steps and it tells me when I have reached some milestone but because I have not made any settings changes it is very sensitive and registers my steps when I am riding in the car. It has a slew of other settings too – weather conditions with variances on location, traffic conditions, sports scores and a lot more (and some of them leave me to wonder why I wold want such on my watch).<br /><br />Though there are a lot of functions on this watch, they are all out of the way and are accessible on demand so it is not cluttered like I have seen on some other watches. Even though there are a lot of functions I personally will not use, they're bound to be useful to others and they hurt nothing by being there – and they can be turned off.<br /><br />Charging speed is phenomenal. I have drained the watch down to close to 0% battery and plugged it into the charger, and it is completely ready to go at 100% about an hour later. With modest use, it takes 3-4 days to drain. I really can't complain about power consumption with this watch.<br /><br />This is a very nice watch and it works very well for me. I love being able to change the face on demand and I like the rich feature set even though I have only started to scratch the surface of all it can do. This is presently my watch of choice.",1480202399000,0,False
4.0,Solid but Expensive Case,"I recently added a Droid Turbo 2 phone to my calling plan and I have been looking for a good case for it. That phone was expensive and it was an investment, so I wanted a good case for it to protect it and keep it safe. The Lifeproof case is one I had heard about and I was glad to have an opportunity to test it and see how well it worked for me. So far, it has met my expectations.<br /><br />This is a full-enclosure case that completely covers the phone on all sides, not just a back and bumper guard case. It is all plastic and the material is neither the strongest nor the cheapest plastic, meaning it could be stronger but that would drive the cost up even more. It seals to be waterproof, and it includes the dongle to allow connecting headphones to the audio jack without having to open up the case.<br /><br />I had no problem getting the case on my phone and it sealed up nicely. I am not brave enough to test the case for waterproofing while my phone is in it, but I have been able to demonstrate that the case is very splash resistant and it has kept the phone protected when outside during rainy conditions.<br /><br />The face is a thin plastic layer that does not seem to impact sensitivity. I was a little surprised at first that it is just a plastic membrane, but having dropped the phone and the screen did not crack or scratch I have to assume then that the membrane is to facilitate keeping out water more than anything else. Perhaps it is just me being fussy but I do prefer tempered glass for screen protection.<br /><br />The case includes full instructions on how to install it, maintenance and care.<br /><br />For drops and falls, so far this case has kept the phone free of damage. I have been told it holds up when the phone is dropped from a height of over 20’ but I have to question under what circumstances I would have that happen to my phone. The only real negative I can find is the price, as it is far and away more expensive than a good number of other cases I looked at, even though this one definitely provides the most solid protection. If you do not have a problem with the expense and you want a good, solid case that will definitely keep your phone safe, this one is worth consideration.",1477244630000,0,False
5.0,"Easy to Apply, No Impact to Responsiveness","I have an iPhone 6s and I have a bad tendency to break my screen protectors on said phone. I am loathe to replace them since they tend to be expensive at the store, and they’re not something I think to buy when I have one that is not broken. I was given an opportunity to test these screen protectors and they have proven to be worth their salt. These are much more affordable than those you buy at a store and they work just as well.<br /><br />These come in a two-pack which is great news for this clumsy fellow. I have a very bad tendency to drop my phone and invariably the screen gets caught right on the edge and the cracks spider out, so having an extra one close by when I do break one again is a good thing. I presently have one of the two applied to my screen and so far it has held up for a couple of weeks. I have dropped my phone a couple of times but so far the screen protector has held.<br /><br />Application is simple and easy. I am used to seeing alcohol wipes in the package with most protectors, but this package did not have one. Everything you need is in there, though. If you are careful and you follow the directions on the package, you end up with a screen protector that fits right and does not have bubbles. I got it right on the first try.<br /><br />The screen protectors do not cover the curve which I have come to regard as a good thing. Screen protectors that wrap around the edges to the metal actually interfere with some phone cases or vice versa.<br /><br />I do like the anti-fingerprint coating which does a decent job of keeping the screen more visible. I dislike a smudged screen so I like how this screen protector helps. It is not 100% fingerprint-proof but it does cut down the prints quite a lot.<br /><br />So far it has not appreciably diminished sensitivity on the screen either. There is certainly some desensitizing that it brings but it is not enough for me to notice. The screen has remained responsive and clear.<br /><br />I have nothing to criticize when it comes to these screen protectors. They go on easy, they fit right, they do not show every last fingerprint and they are substantially less expensive than what you buy in the stores.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Great Way to Upgrade Your Phone's Camera,"With a camera in practically every phone made these days the point-and-shoot camera has become an endangered species. A lot of the cameras in phones are actually quite capable and they do a very good job, but software-driven cameras lack some of the features that are available on more dedicated cameras, like very close-in shots and fish-eye shots. And, unless you have a special case that allows for lenses to be attached and changed, you get just one lens with a phone camera and that’s it. This kit works around that and provides a set of optical lenses that work for practically any phone camera.<br /><br />This set of lenses provides four different lenses: a fish-eye lens, a wide-angle lens, a macro lens and a circular polarizing filter (CPL) lens. With the exception of the wide angle lens these are all stand-alone lenses, but the wide angle lens relies on the macro lens to work (this is the normal configuration for this type of lens). Each lens screws into a clip that simply clamps onto the phone, over the phone’s built-in lens. It’s a simple design and requires no special case or modification to the phone.<br /><br />It should go without saying that the lenses work a little better and you get a better shot when the lenses are close to the phone’s built-in lens. I have a battery case on my phone and it holds the clip about 1/4” from the phone lens and these lenses still work well for me, though I do have to adjust and fiddle with the clip to light things up properly. That’s not a fault with this specific lens kit, it’s a problem with any lens kit if you plan to use it with a thick case.<br /><br />The fish-eye lens it my favorite of the bunch, and it works surprisingly well for a small, clip-on lens. The fish-eye effect is very pronounced with this lens and it is easy to get a very wide angle with it. The wide angle lens is nice and it does capture a wider field of view, though I do not use wide angle lenses even with my dedicated camera so I personally do not have a lot of use for this lens. The macro lens, however is one of the best I have seen, particularly for a clip-on lens, and it does a superb job of getting very close shots. The CPL lens works well too and it is easy to see its effect in testing by pointing it to an LCD screen and turning the lens, and the screen will blacken and come back through the camera. Outdoors this lens does a good job of brightening colors.<br /><br />The lenses come with a nice little carrying bag as well as covers for each individual lens.<br /><br />I am quite pleased with this set and am happy to recommend it. The fish-eye and macro lenses make this set worth the asking price all on their own, but the wide angle lens as well as the CPL are both good in their own right. Overall, this is a very nice set and will definitely enhance the camera in your phone.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

4.0,"Nice Case, but Not a Snug Fit Along the Short Edges","I have an iPhone 6s and I am pleased with it, and I have been looking for the right accessories for it. I have tried dozens of cases and there are two basic types – cases that protect the phone and cases that are more of a fashion statement. This case is in the former category and it’s a nice case overall. I have found one issue with it that is potentially a real problem, though for the moment it is just an irritation.<br /><br />This is an unusual case when compared to many others I have used. It is a two-piece case that most easily goes on the phone in two steps. The main piece is a large rubber shell with squishy bumper protection that makes an excellent shock absorber. Most cases I have used have harder plastic bumper protection or even a metal band, and these are fine but they do not absorb shock as much as something softer. The other part of this case is a hard outer shell that clamps onto the back of the phone and holds the rubber shell in place. If you try to put the whole thing on the phone at once it is quite difficult, but when done one piece at a time it is easy.<br /><br />The case provides soft button covers for the power and volume buttons. These are well placed and seem to work just fine. This is not true of all cases so it is reassuring that this case has the buttons lined up properly. It also has openings for the charging/data port, the speaker and the audio jack. And, the case does not interfere with the vibrate switch.<br /><br />The issue I have with this case is the fit, actually. The case is snug around the long length of the phone which is as it should be. It is loose along the short edges though, enough that bits of debris get in between the case and the phone. On the long edge, the case is tight where the hard shell holds it, but over the buttons it is quite loose like along the short edges. I have not found a workaround for this. The loose fit is the only issue I have found with this case. It’s not loose enough to make the case fall off and it does not compromise the protection, but it does open up the possibility of getting dirt under it.<br /><br />This is a nice case and I do like it. It looks nice, it provides good protection and it is affordable. It is not a completely snug fit, though, which is the one flaw I have found with it.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

4.0,Add Wireless Charging to Your iPhone 6/6s,"I am relatively new to the iPhone, having carried one for just about a year after my older phone died. My previous phone came with a special back that allowed for wireless charging, and I have sorely missed it. I was given the opportunity to test with this case for the iPhone 6/6s and it does work very well for wirelessly charging my iPhone. There are a couple of minor issues I have with it but these are not enough to discourage my use of this case.<br /><br />Charging cases in particular serve two purposes – protecting the phone and providing a mechanism for wireless charging. Wireless charging is an excellent feature – no wear and tear on the lightning cable and no fumbling with a cable that almost fits when there’s a good case on the phone.<br /><br />For wireless charging I will confess to having some initial disappointment that turned out to be not the fault of the case but the charger. With the phone in the case, I set the phone on the charger and it would start to charge and then stop. It did this repeatedly. I thought it was the case until I tried it with a larger, square charging pad and the case worked flawlessly and my phone charged up fairly quickly. Use this case with a larger wireless charging pad for consistent results.<br /><br />The case charges the phone by snapping to the back of the phone and there is a lightning insert to plug into the phone’s lightning port. When fully in place it looks good and the fit is tight – very tight. Getting the phone in the case is no issue, but taking it back out requires some finger strength. This is good and bad at the same time: it is good in that it will not pop off the phone and fit loosely, but it is bad if you want to take the case off for any reason. Plan on exerting some effort if you like to swap your phone case on occasion.<br /><br />In terms of phone protection this case provides basic corner and edge protection. The case frame is very hard and rigid and this is good for preventing corner dents which are more likely to shatter the screen. I would like to have seen more shock absorption in this case on the corners, though, which would add more damage protection for the phone without driving up the cost or interfering with operation. The case does not come with any kind of screen protection other than the bumper guard, so plan on buying a tempered glass screen protector to go with the case. To be fair, very few cases have screen protectors with them so this should not come as a surprise.<br /><br />The main feature of this case is that it can add wireless charging to your iPhone 6/6s, and it does this very well. I am pleased with the charging aspect and I will use this when I am in the office. For protecting the phone, it does an adequate job of corner and edge protection, though a little more shock absorption would be a welcome addition.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

4.0,Allows for Multiple Intervals,"A timer outlet like this one is useful for a number of things, such as setting the coffee pot to go off in the morning just before you get up or for turning a lamp on and off at night to make it look like someone is home when this is not the case. Most of the timer outlets I have seen and used have been simple, analog devices that are pretty easy to set and are mechanical. This is the first digital timer I have seen and used and so far I have had good success with it, save for minor issues.<br /><br />This timer outlet features a large LCD display with the time, day of the week, timer status, mode and whether the timer is set for random mode. It has an internal battery so that it will retain settings during a power outage once it is charged. It has multiple programs that can be set so that it is possible to set the timer to work at the same time every day or to create several different time intervals to power on and off.<br /><br />Setting the timer is mostly easy though I found that setting the time interval worked the exact opposite of what I expected. I contacted the seller and after a discussion with them concluded that I am either reading the instructions incorrectly or reading the timer wrong. Regardless, I have a handle on how to set the timer now and have found a good use for it.<br /><br />I plugged my router into it and used the timer to down the router at a certain time in the night (I have teens – that should explain why I am doing that). I set the timer to shut off my router at midnight and turn it back on at 4am. It did exactly as I had hoped and at midnight the router shut down very abruptly. At 4am it powered back up and worked as expected.<br /><br />I like the fact that there are 10 different programs that can be set so that there is no simple “on at time x, off at time y” setting like with analog timers. Using the various buttons you can set a program to trigger on a certain day, every day, every other day, just weekdays and a lot more. In addition to the day of the week there are buttons to set the hour and minute, turn on random intervals and reset the timer. It’s easy to switch between the clock and timers as well.<br /><br />So far this timer has worked out well for me, though there was some learning required when I first started working with it. Now that I have it figured out it does a good job for me and I like it. I had some issues with figuring out the way it determines when there is power supplied to the device and when it cuts power. The number of different programs and how they can be set up is impressive and this timer can do a lot more than the old analog ones can. It’s a decent timed outlet worth some consideration.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

4.0,Good for Daytime Use,"I have played with several dash cams and they all tend to work about the same. They are useful for recording events on the road provided you have enough storage in them and they usually have good daytime resolution. The differences are usually in the specific features/capabilities and in the extras in the box. They also can differ when it comes to night vision. This particular camera is good for daytime work, but it suffers at night time with poor imaging in low light situations.<br /><br />This is a nice-looking unit that is about 1/3 the size of my GPS navigator. It comes with the extras you need to get going right away – the suction cup, USB cable, car charger and the memory card. The product description is a little off: it says it comes with an 8GB card, but mine came with a 16GB Class 6 card.<br /><br />The camera has a couple of different modes for capturing images. It can capture HD video (which can be ratcheted down, of course) and it can capture still images. Both of these are useful modes depending on what you are trying to accomplish. Keep in mind that this is no substitute for a regular camera or video camera.<br /><br />I had no trouble mounting it on my windshield in the car and I was able to set it up to record. I particularly like the fact that it can record continuously instead of requiring short clips of fixed sizes (unless you want that). I set it to record continuously and went for a drive, recording the whole trip. The image was clear and bright, though the image was slightly distorted due to the wide-angle lens.<br /><br />Others have had some difficulty with night recording so I tried it after sunset too, and I understand the criticisms. It does not adjust well for night driving. When I upped the exposure enough to get images the colors got funny. So, apparently this camera is not well-suited for night recording though it can be made to work.<br /><br />The menu system is fairly straightforward and it is easy to adjust settings. I was able to tweak exposure levels, resolutions and more.<br /><br />I have noticed that the camera drains the battery faster than it can charge when plugged in. So, even when fully charged up and plugged in it will eventually cut off with a dead battery.<br /><br />This is a neat little dash cam and I like it. It does have a couple of small issues but there have been no deal breakers so far. This is a decent little dash cam that works well – in the daytime.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Much Better than a Standard Charger for QC 2.0 Compliant Devices,"Most of the electronic devices in my house do not support the QC 2.0 standard so the majority of devices I have cannot benefit from this charger. However, my son's HTC One M9 does support the standard and the charger that came with his phone does not, so this provided us a good opportunity to test and see how well this charger works and how much better it would perform versus a standard charger. The difference is dramatic and obvious.<br /><br />This is a single-port charger that will work with all manner of USB devices, but it is specifically designed to handle the QC 2.0 standard for devices that can handle it. If a device that does not support the standard is plugged in, it will receive a normal charge which I have been able to demonstrate with my phone. My phone charges at its typical rate when I use this charger. My son's phone is another matter entirely – when we plug it into this charger it charges up in roughly one-third of the time it takes with the charger that came with it.<br /><br />I have not yet put a power meter on this charger to see the difference in output. I will do so when I get the chance and come back to update this review.<br /><br />This is a solid little charger and it compacts for travel. That is, the prongs fold in so the unit can be packed up in a travel bag and is good to go. This is good for my son as he can take a charger with him and leave one at home, so he will not be without a charger.<br /><br />Overall, this charger has worked out well for us. It is definitely much better at charging the QC 2.0 device we have tried with it than other chargers, including the manufacturer's charger. It is small, compact, suitable for travel and it works very well. The price is quite reasonable too, making this a good charger if you have a device that can get the full benefits from it.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Well-Made Leather Wallet Case,"I have always liked wallet-style cases, as much for the aesthetics but also for the added screen protection that the flap offers the screen. Shieldon makes good wallet cases, and this one is for the iPhone 6/6s. So far, I am pleased with it and have no complaints.<br /><br />The plastic shell fits my phone very well. It is a thin but hard plastic material and it snaps on the phone with minimal effort. It went on easy enough that I was concerned about how well it would hold the phone, but I had a much more difficult time taking my phone back out of the case than I did putting it in. Based on that, I believe it will be a good case that will not let the phone escape from it.<br /><br />The shell is bound to the leather case very well and I was unable to get it to give any without putting enough strain on it to damage the whole. It should be fine for most drops and falls, though like any other leather case there is a limit to how much stress it will handle before it breaks loose.<br /><br />The leather flap has three credit card slots as well as a longer hidden slot for larger things like money. Cards fit in the pockets easily and this is a convenience for when you do not wish to travel with more than just your phone and keys.<br /><br />I looked this case over for blemishes and flaws and found none. The stitching is very tight and straight, the leather itself is pristine and clean and the seams are uniform. I have seen a few cases with loose stitching, but this one is made well.<br /><br />If you prefer wallet cases to traditional shell cases, this is a good one to consider. It is made very well, it fits the phone correctly and it is not overly expensive. Consider this one if you want a nice, wallet-style leather case.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

3.0,WaterProof Case for iPhone 6; Impacts Usability,"I have looked at a lot of different phone cases for my iPhone 6 and this case is one of the ones I looked at. I was interested in the waterproof aspect of it, but I also was curious to see if it was going to be a solid case that would hold up. I would say it's a good case to a point.<br /><br />This is a full case that completely covers your phone on all sides. It snaps together very stiffly and it is very difficult to pry open again after it has been closed. This is a good sign in that it is not going to accidentally come apart when you need to to stay together most. I am very willing to put up with the tightness in exchange for security for my phone.<br /><br />This is a stiff plastic case and it actually has little flex to it even when it is empty which is good. The plastic is not so hard that I would call it brittle, but it is hard enough that I am curious to see what will happen when it is sufficiently cold and I accidentally drop my phone. I am not sure if the plastic will be brittle when it is cold, though I would hope not.<br /><br />The case has a built-in screen protector and this is a very good feature. I like the fact that there is a screen protector at all, though I would have preferred a tempered glass front instead of just a plastic anti-scratch front. Still, many cases come with no screen protection at all and so I think having the plastic anti-scratch cover is more than most have. Keep in mind that this just protects against scratches and will not help against impact damage.<br /><br />The main feature of this case it waterproofing. In limited testing it does seem to work well in that regard. I am not willing to submit this case (with my phone in it) to a submersion test but I can say it passes a running water test when the ports have been sealed. It likely will be fine in a brief submersion situation though I would get it out of the water as quickly as possible.<br /><br />The waterproofing comes at a price, though. With this particular case, the microphone slot is covered and it interferes with the call. Others with whom I have spoken when my phone is in the case have told me I sound muffled. The plastic screen protector covers the speaker through which you listen as well and there is a very small impact when carrying on a conversation – not enough to interfere, but enough to notice. Also, there is a plastic film over the hole for the camera flash, and it is hard to clean when it gets dirty due to being recessed in the case. This is enough to degrade the effectiveness of said flash.<br /><br />This is not a bad case. It is actually a decent case and it seems to work well for its intended purpose. It does provide good protection for the phone and it is very hard to open once closed, making it very likely to keep the phone secure within. It does interfere with calls, though, and this is something to consider when looking for a waterproof case: it is not easy to get the phone out of the case very quickly, so it might prove a little frustrating when trying to use the phone with this case.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Two Functions in One Cable,"If you have Apple and Android devices you know the aggravation of having a tangle of separate cables on the desk. Apple does not support the micro USB plug so it needs its own cable. This cable does a lot to help eliminate some clutter and reduce cabling – because of the special converter plug on the end, it can handle both types of interfaces.<br /><br />Without the cap on the micro USB end, this would be a normal USB cable that is in use with almost all other phones. The difference is the cap that converts this cable into a lightning cable when put on the end correctly.<br /><br />Being a non-Apple cable it is important to have MFi certification. This cable is certified and when plugged in to my Apple phone it takes a charge from this cable without any issues at all – no annoying warnings about unauthorized cables.<br /><br />I like that Abusun pout their name right on the cable plug itself so there is no question who made this cable. This is a good thing, as too often I find that manufacturers put no effort into branding their merchandise. When a manufacturer does this, it is a good sign that the manufacturer believes in their product enough to advertise.<br /><br />This is a good cable that fills the need for two separate cables in one. It works well and it is affordable.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Basic But Effective Bumper Protection for a Decent Price,"Having recently purchased on iPhone to replace my Windows phone I have been looking for cases for this that provide good protection against drops and bumps. Most cases provide little for screen protection and those that do are usually marginal at best. I decided to try this phone case by MouseLemur and so far it has worked out well for me. I would recommend getting a tempered glass screen protector to go with it of course, as it offers little in the way of direct screen protection.<br /><br />Most of the damaged screens on smartphones that I have seen have been the result of corner drops. This is the most common kind of accidental damage that a phone will sustain and the corner drop surprisingly effective at actually causing a lot of damage, as the screen bears the brunt of the shock of hitting the ground. A tempered glass screen protector is a good idea for protecting the screen, but in my experience the majority of cases where such a screen protector is important is in impact damage. For really cutting corner drop damage, a good case is much more effective, and really you need a rubber bumper case or a comprehensive case for that kind of damage protection. (Note, I am not saying to not use a tempered glass screen protector, but I am saying that a case is more important.)<br /><br />This case is a mostly clear case, with colors around the edges and corners. The edge and corner rim is a bit thicker than the back so there is more cushion where the phone is likely to make contact with the ground. The idea here is that the case will absorb most of the shock which cuts down the amount of shock that transfers to the screen. Along the bumper are the cutouts and false buttons which are placed correctly and do not interfere with the operation of the phone.<br /><br />I like the clear portion of the case which is nice if you want to see the phone itself instead of a design. This is strictly aesthetics, but it is a consideration nonetheless. I like being able to see my phone as it is an elegant device.<br /><br />It fits my phone snugly which means it is not likely to let the phone slip out. It takes a little effort to get it in the case and it takes a little more to get it back out – a good fit.<br /><br />The big selling point of this case is actually the price. It really is not an expensive case and I have seen more pricey cases that offer less bumper protection.<br /><br />This is a nice bumper case. It is nothing fancy, but it serves a functional role and for that purpose it is designed well. Between the bumper protection, good looks and great price point, this is a good phone case that's worth consideration.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,"Edge to Edge Coverage, Does not Interfere with Screen Sensitivity","A screen protector is one of the most important accessories you can have for your smartphone. There are a number of options available for the iPhone 6 Plus, the best ones I know of are tempered glass. This is a tempered glass phone screen protector and it covers the screen from edge to edge, something that not all screen protectors actually do.<br /><br />This is a very thin screen protector, thinner than most of the others I have seen. That said, it is still tempered glass which makes it superior to most of the cheap plastic screen protector sheets I have seen.  Because it is so thin it does flex a bit but do not deliberately bend it as you can snap it in half if you are not careful (I have done this with others).<br /><br />Application of this screen protector is typical. Make sure the phone screen is completely clean, dry and free of any particles of anything. I have issues with dust when I apply these to screens – no matter how clean I get the screen and no matter how careful I have been I almost always have some little bit of something that gets on the screen as I lay down the screen protector. I got lucky this time and came out with a clean application.<br /><br />This is a full edge-to-edge screen protector and leaves no edge around the screen exposed. This is good – I have lost at least one screen protector because of damage that happened right on the edge of the screen and taking a hit on the actual screen itself was s close call. That little bit of added coverage that many screen protectors do not prove can be the difference between a cracked screen and just a cracked screen protector.<br /><br />This screen protector does not interfere with the screen sensitivity. It is very thin, though I have used thinner, and it allows for full sensitivity on the screen. It is also nice and smooth so my finger glides on the surface without issue.<br /><br />The claim is that it is fingerprint-proof. That's not quite right, though it is resistant to getting as dirty as quickly and it is very easy to clean off.<br /><br />I like this screen protector. It's easy to apply, gives good screen coverage and does not interfere with the  operation of the screen.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Very Thin and Smooth Screen Protector,"In addition to a good case, a smartphone really needs screen protection, a feature than many cases do not include or provide. The few that do offer screen protectors usually include cheap plastic sheets that are fine for reducing scratches but they do little to prevent shatters from drops or punctures. This screen protector it tempered glass and provides much better protection from gash and drop damage than a plastic protector could ever provide.<br /><br />This is a clear screen protector, not a tinted or privacy screen, and it really has no impact on the screen's clarity or color. It also is smooth to the touch instead of matte finish so your finger slides effortlessly across the screen. To be fair, I do not mind a screen protector that has a slight bit of texture, but those tend to interfere slightly with the sensitivity of the screen.<br /><br />Application of this screen protector is very easy and straightforward, but it does require some preparation. Included are wet and dry cleaning cloths, but I have found that cleaning with a microfiber cable is basically required to get all contaminants off the screen. With the screen cleaned, dried and devoid of link, hair or other little particles I was able to apply the screen protector with almost no issues.<br /><br />Though this screen cover is thicker than any plastic sheet I have used, it is thinner than every other glass sheet I have used for any phone. It has zero impact on sensitivity (well, I don't notice any difference).<br /><br />This is a decent screen protector and it works very well. It is super thin for a glass protector, it's easy to apply and it's very smooth so it doesn't affect using the phone. This is not expensive for a screen protector (especially when compared to ones you buy in a store), making this a very good value.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,"Warm, Comfy Beanie with Decent Sound","I grew up always loving music. Even as a youngster I had a radio in my room and listened while doing homework. Music has changes a lot since that time and so has the way we listen to it. Bluetooth headphones, headsets and speakers abound, bringing private wireless listening to most people now. My son has a beanie similar to this one so I was happy to get one for myself. The obvious feature is the inclusion of a Bluetooth receiver and speakers, but it also is a nice beanie that will keep your head nice and warm.<br /><br />This is a knit beanie of unknown material. I am not sure if it is cotton or a blend. I do know it is not actually wool. One thing I noticed right out of the package is that it has a very distinctive smell to it, like it has been stored in an old wooden chest or a closet for a long time – not mildew or must but distinctive and unmistakable.<br /><br />I put this beanie on my head and it was of course a little tight at first. Once I got it adjusted and it had a chance to relax it got very comfortable and warm. The speakers along the rim fit over my ears perfectly and are not uncomfortable, though I am definitely more aware of the control side when wearing this beanie. Even so, this is more comfortable than most on-ear headphones.<br /><br />Pairing the beanie is a non-event. I turned it on and paired to to my phone. It identifies itself as “BT-03S” and it paired and connected easily and without any issues.<br /><br />I turned on the music and it definitely comes through clearly. As the beanie does not fit tightly and the speakers are not pressed tight against the ear, the bass is a little lacking which is to be expected. I did not expect this to have heavy bass and I was right. The bass is a little better than I thought it would be though, but it's a far cry from a set of headphones.<br /><br />The Bluetooth receiver has about a 20' range. I walked about that far from my phone before it started to cut out and stutter. This is very much in the range of reasonable.<br /><br />Controlling the beanie is easy. There are buttons for powering on and off, moving between tracks and raising/lowering volume.<br /><br />This is a nice beanie that makes listening to music a lot more fun and enjoyable. The beanie will keep your head and ears warm, and the music will keep you smiling. If you have a teenager in the house, this makes a good gift idea too.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Excellent Value!,"Lightning cables are a necessary part of owning an iPhone, iPad or iPod. The problem is that Apple-branded cables are expensive and not all third-party parts are worth buying. I have seen cables that are poorly made with sub-par materials and I have seen some high-end cables too. This three-pack of cables is a no-frills set of cables, but it has one thing that is unusual that makes it very much worth consideration – a lifetime warranty.<br /><br />This is a very inexpensive set of cables, costing (at this time) just $10 for a three-pack. That’s about half of what a single Apple-branded cable costs. That alone gave me pause when I ordered – would these be made well enough to hold up over time?<br /><br />They seem to be made well enough. The plug ends are hard molded plastic with no seams so they will not fall apart unless broken or cracked. They have rubber sleeves to help reinforce the connection with the wires which adds some strength when bending. The wires themselves are insulated in tight-fitting plastic that is well-attached to the plugs – I was unable to pull the insulation away from the plugs which would have exposed the wires underneath. This is a no-nonsense design.<br /><br />What makes these cables worth the purchase is the fact that the company offers a lifetime warranty on them. To service a $3 cable will cost the company far more than $3, so they must feel confident that their cables will hold up. They would not stand behind them with a warranty of any kind.<br /><br />As plain cables these are not especially remarkable, good or bad. But, considering that the price per unit is so low, the quality seems to be comparable to Apple-branded cables and the company offers a lifetime warranty, it is hard to ignore these as a viable option, especially if you want more than just one cable.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,More Fashion than Function but Worth the Asking Price,"Note: There are several different packs of cases offered here. I have the 8-pack and my review is written to reflect such.<br /><br />Having just bought an iPhone 6s I look for accessories that will work with it and especially ones that will protect my investment. I was a little skeptical of an 8-pack of cases that goes for less than $10, but after trying these I think it's a good deal. These offer minimal protection and I would not recommend them for full-time protection of the phone but they do offer more than enough to justify the price per case – at the time of this writing working out to about $1.13 per case.<br /><br />These are about the simplest cases I have seen. They have clear plastic backs and colored bumper guards. They provide everything a case should have – openings for the speaker, audio jack, camera and microphone and button covers that allow one to work the buttons even when in the case. The bumper guard is thin and it offers minimal protection but it is better than nothing. It can mean the difference between a shattered screen when the phone is dropped from a short distance and a screen that remains intact. There is not enough cushion in the bumper guards to help with a bigger drop.<br /><br />The phone snaps in easily and everything is lined up nicely with these cases. The fit is snug and it will definitely keep dirt from getting in, but it is not so tight that putting the phone in or taking it out could be called difficult.<br /><br />These are the most simple and basic of cases. If they were priced as much as $5 per case I would be reluctant to recommend them at all. However at the price they do offer some value and they give you some choice of color based on your mood. If you want minimal protection and you want choices in colors to suit your mood – and you want to keep it inexpensive – these are a great buy. Again, I cannot recommend these as the primary case to use with the phone, but for occasional use and as a fashion accessory they're just fine and are worth the asking price.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,"Looks Good, Made Well and Protects the Phone","I recently gave up my previous smartphone for an iPhone 6s. The unfortunate part of swapping phones is that it means accessories that worked with the old phone do not necessarily work for the new one. A prime example of this is whatever case you have for the old phone – unless you get the same make and model, the likelihood of the case fitting the new phone is very small at best. This case is one of the available choices for the iPhone 6/6s and I have always favored wallet cases. I have not had it long but so far I am very pleased with it. It looks great, it seems to be made well and it definitely protects my phone.<br /><br />This is a folio style of case, a type that I especially favor as I like the added protection against scratches and gouges that the flap provides for the screen. On the inside of the flap are three credit card pockets and a place for bills though the pocket for bills is not long enough to accommodate cash without folding the money (this is a function of the size of the phone, not a problem with the case). I should mention that this kind of case does add a lot of bulk to the phone in terms of the thickness.<br /><br />I have been trying to figure out what kind of material was used to make this case. There is a leather border around the edges, but the main piece of material is something else, almost like a pressed vinyl or waxed canvas? Is it not clear, but it is a tough material that looks good and provides some padding as well as protection.<br /><br />I snapped my phone into the case and it is a very tight fit. So, I know I do not need to worry about my phone slipping out at an inopportune time. The hard plastic holder provides access to all of the important ports, outputs and buttons, though the button covers are a touch stiff and hard to push – not enough to hinder operation, but definitely more effort is required than when using the buttons directly. The charging/sync cable plugs in without obstruction, but plugging in a 3.5mm headphone jack requires some effort as the case does make connecting headphones with all but the smallest plugs a little more difficult due to how close the plastic molding is to the edge of the port. To me this is a small price to pay.<br /><br />The plastic holder is reinforced on the corners and provides some drop protection. I have seen folio cases that offer little reinforcement there which is ok for short drops as the leather portion of the case does provide a limited amount of protection. It is a small detail but it is important – the extra protection can mean the difference between a cracked screen and a phone with no damage.<br /><br />Many cases do not come with an actual screen protector. This one does. It is a plastic sheet cover for the screen, which for a case like this is fine if you plan to keep it in the case most of the time. If you plan to take it out of the case or use your phone with half-shell cases too, you might instead consider getting a tempered glass screen protector as well.<br /><br />I had my phone in my pocket and went to a local pumpkin farm and spent some time in the barn there. There was dust everywhere and it was hard to breathe. When I left the barn I dug out my phone, and the case had kept is mostly free of dust and debris. That's about all I could ask.<br /><br />I really like this case. It looks good and it protects my phone. It's not really very expensive either. If you like folio cases and you have an iPhone 6/6s, this is a good case that's worth a look.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Solid and Very Stable Banana Stand,"We recently had to replace the banana stand we had used for years, after it finally broke. It was a basic plastic device but it did the job. I was much more interested in finding one that would last and looked more substantial than the cheap one we had and I was very pleased to have the opportunity to work with this banana stand. It is far and away better than our old one and I am very pleased with it.<br /><br />Instead of plastic, this is a metal frame banana tree. It is made of steel and is painted a dark brown, almost black. It weighs substantially more than plastic stands and it is definitely stronger. My older stand was all plastic and what eventually gave out was the hook – this will not be an issue with this stand.<br /><br />This is a fairly large banana stand, quite a bit taller than our previous one. It can accommodate even larger bananas and it keeps them off the counter. It is also very solid and steady and does not seen to have any issues with stability, staying stable even when loaded up heavily. My older plastic one had some difficulty with this and would occasionally tumble if we tried to load it up too heavily. It is refreshing to not have to worry about this anymore.<br /><br />Aside from being heavy and stable, this is also an attractive stand and it matches well with modern kitchens as well as country or rustic kitchens.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this banana stand and am happy to recommend it. Don't bother with a plastic stand, get a good one. This is a good one and will serve you well for a long time.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Works Well and Doesn't Retain Heat Like Plastic Chargers,"NOTE: This review is for the bamboo wireless charger.<br /><br />I have a phone that is capable of receiving a wireless charge and it is a feature I use frequently. I like the convenience and I like not having to mess with plugging in USB cables. This is a nice wireless charger that works well and it’s attractive too.<br /><br />This is a small charger about the size of a coaster and the outer shell is made of bamboo. I like the grain pattern and how it is laminated together; I count 14 layers of lamination and the layers are very smoothly bonded so that the whole unit feels like it was cut from a single piece.<br /><br />When this charger is plugged in and there is no phone to charge, there is an LED that shines solid green to indicate that it has power. When the phone is placed on the charger the LED switches from solid green to flashing green and blue to show it is delivering a charge.<br /><br />Like most chargers, positioning is important and if the phone is not aligned correctly it will not receive a charge. Fortunately it is easy to get the alignment right and so far I have had no issues with the phone not charging. I have also observed that the charger will not charge the phone when flipped upside-down, so ensure that the charger is right-side up when using.<br /><br />I have observed that this particular charger does not suffer from heat retention as I have seen with other similar chargers, particularly ones with plastic shells. My phone gets warm when it is being charged wirelessly, so I need a charger that does not get hot with the phone. This charger does get slightly warm where the phone sits, but it is not as bad as with some others I have tried so I am satisfied with this charger’s performance there.<br /><br />Overall I am pleased with this wireless charger. It works well, it looks nice and it does not get as warm as other chargers I have tried.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

4.0,Needs Different Adapter Types,"I have a good collection of USB cables and this one is by far the most interesting and unusual. It has a very definite coolness factor to it and it does work. I do have a reservation about it though when it comes to practicality. It is very close to ideal, but it misses that mark by just one thing – different connector types.<br /><br />This is a USB cable above all. It is designed to plug into a Type A USB port on one end, and the adapters included give you micro USB connectivity on the other. Herein lies the problem – there are two included adapters, and both of them are the same. Why? This cable would have been a lot more versatile and useful if the adapters were different. That is, why not include a lightning adapter, a wide Apple adapter or the older, larger micro USB interfaces? Instead, this cable becomes a simple micro USB cable and little more.<br /><br />As a micro USB cable, it works just fine. I have been able to charge my phone and transfer data with it which is really all I need.<br /><br />As a USB cable, this is a good one and I am pleased with it. As a cable with changeable adapters on the end, it is a disappointment, not because it does not work but because there is only one single adapter type. I have rated it as highly as I have because as a USB cable it works well and it's highly identifiable.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Good Grip and Good Heat Protection,"Silicone utensils and bakeware are the current trend in home cooking circles and one of the more interesting ideas of late is silicone baking gloves. These replace oven mitts and pot holders and have some very distinct advantages. I have had the privilege of working with this particular set of gloves for a couple of weeks and so far I am very pleased with them.<br /><br />First, these are gloves, not mitts, and that in itself is an advantage when it comes to grip. Because the fingers are all separate, it is easier to grip and hold things that are otherwise more difficult when using mitts. Even something like a dutch oven with handles is easier to pick up with gloves versus mitts.<br /><br />These are made of soft silicone and they are covered all over with little heart-shaped bumps that help improve grip. These are especially useful when picking up things made of glass such as a baking dish, though on things like cast iron this is less impactful.<br /><br />I decided to try something with the gloves to see how well they help with grip and I wore them while cleaning fish. This was a bad idea and it did not work out. The fish was a lot easier to hold without the gloves on. Lesson learned. However, they worked very well when scooping hard-boiled eggs from hot water - I got a good grip on the egg and I avoided scalding my hand, though after a couple of eggs the gloves did start to pass on some of the heat. So, these are fine for a quick dip in boiling water but not sustained work.<br /><br />One big advantage these gloves have over their fibrous or textile–based counterparts is that they are waterproof. Cotton mitts might be comfortable but if you get them wet and pick up something hot it will scorch the glove and burn your hand. That does not happen with these gloves.<br /><br />Overall I am happy with these gloves. They work well, they keep the heat out and they are grippy enough that I can pick up things a lot more easily than if I used mitts.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,"Pen Writes Nicely, Stylus Doesn't Skip or Stutter","We have arrived at the point in technology where most new computers and all tablets have touch screens. The problem with touch screens is that it is all too easy to leave fingerprints on them. These pens come with a rubber stylus on the top which is designed for touch screen use and so far these pens have worked out well for us.<br /><br />These are attractive pens in six pretty colors. The lower half of the pen body is a solid color and the upper half is clear with colored crystalline stones inside. The very top is a rubber stylus and the lower chamber contains an ink cartridge. For their size they are very slightly heavy and they feel absolutely solid. Overall, nice pens.<br /><br />I took one of them and wrote a little bit. The ink came out smooth and I got a nice, clean line with no clumping, no blotting and no skipping. These write very nicely. The ink cartridge within is a little on the small side which is the only disappointment as it means they will run out of ink sooner rather than later.<br /><br />The stylus works very well. We tried these pens on a laptop screen as well as a tablet screen and both devices responded beautifully. I have used other styli that skip and stutter a little because they catch on the surface of the glass; these do not suffer from that problem in my experience. Scrolling was smooth and clean and highlighting text was also effortless.<br /><br />Overall these are really nice pens that double as touchscreen styli. They write smoothly and the stylus does not skip or stutter on the glass which all I could ask for. For those of us with fat fingers, these solve a problem with touchscreens and bring the extra function of ink pens to the table as well.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Simple to Use and it Works,"One of the biggest aggravations I have faced when traveling is that my mobile phone is very efficient at erasing hotel keys. Although less of a concern I do not like powering off my phone or turning the volume all the way down all of the time even when I need to silence it.  This little pouch seems to be a good solution.<br /><br />In appearance on the outside this little pouch does not appear to be anything special. It is a nylon weave bag about the size of a business envelope with no remarkable features on the outside. However, on the inside is a pocket made of reflective, tightly woven material that does not appear especially interesting - until you put your phone in there.<br /><br />I have a Nokia phone and I put it in the pouch, in the pocket where the reflective surface would face my phone on both sides. Before I put in my phone I observed that I had a good LTE signal, 3 of 5 bars in my basement. Within 30 seconds of putting my phone in there and partially closing the flap, my signal was gone and the phone was not able to even recognize the service provider to which it should connect. I pulled the phone out and it shot back up to 3 bars immediately.<br /><br />I have not yet had an opportunity to see if it will work to prevent the phone from demagnetizing a hotel key but I will get to do so next month. When that happens I will return here to update my review.<br /><br />This pouch definitely isolates the phone and makes it easy to lturn the phone off without actually turning it off. It completely cuts off the phone’s ability to connect to the network and it is very easy to use. It’s easier to remember to take my phone out of the pouch than it is to remember to turn it back on again.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Basic Protection for your iPhone 6,"Even a minimalist phone case that provides basic protection is a good investment. Most of the damage to phones I have seen has been when they have been dropped and they hit on a corner, and as a result the screen shatters. This case provides enough protection to help alleviate that problem and it does so at a very minimal cost.<br /><br />This is a clear half-shell case that protects the sides and back of the phone. It does not offer screen protection but this seems to be becoming the norm anymore. It fits the iPhone 6 very well and provides easy access to the buttons on the sides as well as providing for the audio jack, charging port and speaker on the bottom. There’s a cut-out for the camera as well.<br /><br />What is most interesting about this case is that, even though it is somewhat stiff this is a very flexible case. As an experiment I folded it in half (literally - I touched the top of the case to the bottom by folding it like a sheet of paper) and it popped back into shape without a single indicator that it had been treated so, save for my fingerprints. It’s a little rigid to fold lengthwise so the sides would touch so I didn’t push it.<br /><br />The case is sufficiently flexible and pliable to absorb most drops and jolts. The case should absorb the majority of the shock and protect the phone it holds on the sides, corners and the back. I am not willing to test this on purpose for what should be obvious reasons. That said, when in place with the phone you can push hard on the corners and feel that the case offers some give which will absorb a modest shock.<br /><br />There really is only one negative and it is because of the fact that the case is clear: all dirt, dust, fingerprints and other marks are plainly visible on this case. If this bothers you, be ready to clean it often, but if it does not then there’s nothing about which to worry. I won’t say this is a big problem, just a point about which to be aware.<br /><br />This is an inexpensive case but it provides some protection for the iPhone 6. If you have limited funds and you want to protect your phone from most drops and bumps, this case is worth a look.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,No-Frills USB 3.0 Cable,"I have worked with other NewLobo cables and have come to recognize them as inexpensive but higher quality. I had high expectations for this cable and so far it has met those expectations.<br /><br />This cable supports the larger 3.0 USB interface on the device end. Most devices use the mini or micro USB interface so be sure your device needs this specific cable before you buy.<br /><br />There are a couple of things I look for in cables. First, I look for connectors that are attached properly and are unlikely to pull loose or allow the shielding to separate. With this cable, the shielding is part of the plug so there is no concern at all about separation - a good sign. I also look for shielding that is tight and is unlikely to snag or catch on sharp things around my desk or along the edge of the floor, and with this cable the shielding is very tight around the actual cabling.<br /><br />Speed-wise, this cable is very capable of supporting and maintaining USB 3.0 speeds and I have been very pleased with the throughput I get with it. I have it connected to my printer and the printer has been very responsive when I have sent data to it.<br /><br />Though strictly aesthetic, I like the fact that this cable happens to be a dark shade of blue instead of black, white or gray. This makes figuring out where it is connected a lot easier since the other USB 3.0 cables I have are almost all black. I do wish NewLobo had actually put their name on it somewhere as they offer a warranty with the cable, though because it is the only blue one I have it will be easy to identify if it fails.<br /><br />This is a good cable, just as I expected it to be. It has good throughput, it seems to be made very well and the fact that it’s blue makes it stand out. It also happens to be inexpensive. If you want a good USB 3.0 cable, and you prefer to keep it inexpensive, this is the cable you need.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Basic Protection for an iPhone 6 on a Budget,"A phone case is not just an accessory for your phone, it is an investment to protect your phone. Even a less expensive case can save you a lot of money in repairs later. This is one of those less expensive cases that provides very basic protection for an iPhone 6. Normally I prefer something a little more substantial than this type of case, but this case is targeted for base level protection on a budget and for that purpose it is a fine product.<br /><br />This is a very basic case, a simple rubberized half-shell sleeve that provides protection to the sides and back of the phone. It is sufficient for corner and back drops, though it is not enough to protect against crush damage and it does not protect the screen. This is the kind of case you buy when you expect your phone to be used gently and not exposed to an environment where it is more likely to be dropped often.<br /><br />It snaps easily to the phone and exposes all of the important ports and interfaces - the camera, the audio port, the microphone and the speaker. The buttons are covered but the case provides equivalents that allow for easy button pushes that require very little additional effort.<br /><br />So, for such minimal protection, why would I rate this five stars? Simple - this is not designed to be a high-end case, it is meant to be very basic protection and it does that. And, considering the price, it provides this protection on a budget. For a simple rubber sleeve, this case is actually a pretty good deal and most of the time it will keep the phone from damage when the phone is bumped or dropped. If that’s all that you expect to happen to your phone, you don’t need anything more substantial than this case.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Works Well with My External Hard Drives,"I have a couple of USB 3.0 external hard drives that I use for storing pictures and software archives, and both of them use this exact cable type to connect to the computer. I was interested in the NewLobo cable as a spare cable as I am always misplacing the ones I use with the drives and having a backup cable would be very handy. So far this cable has worked out very well for me and has given me no issues at all.<br /><br />First things first - NewLobo offers a 1-year warranty on their cable and that says a lot. It’s not a particularly expensive cable and it would cost more to replace the cable under warranty than the cable is actually worth. This says that NewLobo believes in their product and that’s a big deal to me. I have used so many products that have a nameless, faceless manufacturer and when it breaks there’s no recourse. Even if it is just a simple cable, I find it reassuring that the manufacturer stands behind it.<br /><br />This is the flat-style cable, not round, and there are some advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, it is less likely to tangle. That said, I am usually not a fan of flat cables as I can’t help but think that a flat cable is weaker at the ends where it connects to the plugs. This is based on speculation only and has no basis on experience.<br /><br />Operationally, it is a perfect drop-in replacement for the cables that come with my drives. I did not notice a speed difference between this cable and the others I use and I had no trouble mounting/unmounting/accessing my drives through this cable. I am satisfied with it.<br /><br />The fact that these come in a 2-pack is gravy.<br /><br />I am satisfied with this cable and am happy to recommend it. It’s a no-nonsense cable that gets the job done, and it is not expensive at all - especially in a 2-pack.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Tempered Glass Privacy Screen - Works Great,"Most people think of screen protection for a mobile phone as a glass or plastic cover that prevents the actual screen from shattering. That’s true, this is the most important aspect of screen protection. But, what about protecting the data displayed on the screen? I have seen privacy screens for laptop screens, but this is the first I have used with a mobile phone and it works exactly like the laptop screen protectors.<br /><br />Similar to a regular screen protector, this is a thin sheet of glass that applies very smoothly and easily with no bubbles. It has fine screen coverage to the edge of the phone - this has been an issue on some other screen protectors I have used but not this one.<br /><br />With this screen protector in place, the screen is definitely darker than usual and it might be helpful to adjust the screen brightness. It is a lot like looking at your screen through a pair of sunglasses. Turning the phone at a 45-degree angle makes the screen appear completely black as if the screen has been turned off - no light can be seen at all.<br /><br />Before I put this protector on the phone I held it up to a light source and saw a repeating pattern of the light source itself, almost like I had held up a mirror to a mirror to get a replicated image. I think this protector works via polarized light and the repeating image is an effect of that - I have seen similar phenomena when wearing polarizing sunglasses.<br /><br />If protecting the data on your phone screen is as important to you as protecting the screen itself, this is the screen protector you need. It works great, is easy to apply and is sufficient protection for you phone’s screen to prevent physical damage. Just make sure you have the right one for your model of phone.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Beautiful Wallet Case,"I prefer wallet cases to traditional half-shell cases for the simple reason that they protect the screen a bit better from puncture and crush damage. This particular wallet case is a lot more elegant and exotic than most that I have seen and it has some nice features to it.<br /><br />First off, this is a real leather wallet. I have the cappuccini version which is a creamy brown color. It’s not cow leather but instead is (I think) ostrich leather. It is covered in the distinctive pock marks for where feathers were when the bird was alive and as such it gives this case a very distinctive and exotic look. I have seen men’s wallets made with this same leather.<br /><br />Inside there are five pockets on the left side (the flap) and the fifth pocket has a clear plastic window for showing a picture ID like a driver’s license. Behind the pockets is a place for larger items like cash. If you don’t wish to carry more than the phone and you would rather leave your regular wallet or purse at home, this case can store everything you need except your keys. The right side holds just one thing - the phone.<br /><br />It took me a few minutes to figure out how to get the phone in the case before I realized that there is a small flap that is not sewn down on the left side of the phone holder that slides out from where it’s tucked in to make room for getting the phone in the holder. One the phone is in, the flap is tucked back in and the phone is very secure. It is very highly unlikely that this case will allow the phone to fall out, though I imagine if you shake the case very hard it can be done.<br /><br />When snapped shut this looks like a miniature version of a woman’s purse. The wrist strap adds some functionality and also furthers the image of being a purse.<br /><br />I have looked over this case very carefully and have found no loose stitching or uneven seams. All sewing seems to be very tight and well-done. If not abused this case should last longer than the phone it is designed to protect.<br /><br />In terms of protection, this case does a fine job. It keeps the screen from taking direct hits and it provides sufficient edge and corner protection to absorb drops and falls without too much trouble. This is not a crush-proof case by any means and will not help if shoved in a back pocket and sat upon but it is enough to keep the phone safe from most dangers.<br /><br />This is a very nice and elegant case, well made and providing good protection for an iPhone 6. It does add some bulk, of course, but it makes up for it in style. Overall, this is a very nice case and is worth consideration if you want a wallet case.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Perfect for My Needs,"We live about 5-10 minutes from a water park and what to do with my phone while there has been a concern I have entertained for a while. I do not want to just leave it in the car and lockers are expensive. My particular phone is not waterproof so I have limited options. This particular waterproof pouch/case is just the solution I needed.<br /><br />The pouch portion of this case is a polyurethane bag of sufficient thickness to protect against most bumps and scratches. It has a clear front so that the face of the phone can be seen and it allows some interaction with the phone. The clamp on the top is a two-piece assembly with plastic hooks that snap the two halves together and close the bag, forming a seal. I was skeptical of this design until I actually put some air in the bag and closed it with the clamp. It’s not just water-tight, it’s actually air-tight. If you put your phone in this bag and seal it properly you can submerge your phone underwater without any concern. That said, I would probably not go diving with it as it is not clear as to how deep it is certified to protect when submerged.<br /><br />Included with the pouch is a lanyard so that it can be warn around the neck if desired as well as an armband. On the back of the pouch is a loop for the armband but it will just as easily work as a belt loop.<br /><br />I can’t really find any problems with this case and I think it’s a great solution for anyone wanting to keep a phone - or any other small device or item - dry without worrying about leaks or water damage. This little case is going with me whenever I go to the lake or into the woods - and it’s definitely going to the water park.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,A Lot of Phone for a Little Price,"[[VIDEOID:1874099f0059609f7c4c05ea34c2343e]] Finding a good smartphone is easy. Finding the right smartphone is a lot more difficult due to the large number of choices available. Of all the choices available, Android is probably the strongest choice (though some would argue that an iPhone is better). The IRULU V1S is a *large* Android phone and has a number of excellent features that make it worth your consideration, especially when considering the low price point. There is one catch with this phone that is important to note, though - it is 3G, not 4G.<br /><br />As mentioned above, this is a very large phone boasting a 5"" screen. That said, it is very thin and streamlined, just a quarter inch thick which makes it easy to drop in any pocket or tuck into a purse or briefcase. It is very reminiscent of the Motorola RAZR line of phones - very thin and compact.<br /><br />A big screen is not useful if it is unresponsive or if it isn't bright and sharp. Fortunately, this phone's screen is very responsive and very bright and crisp. On most phone screens I have seen at least occasional problems with touching the screen and getting either no response, a delayed response or bad calibration and so far this phone has shown none of these problems. More impressive is the fact that the screen resolution and quality make for exceptional sharpness and the screen is brighter than average. In fact by default it is so bright that it hurt my eyes in a dark room and it wasn't even turned all the way up. I ended up changing the setting to auto-adjust the brightness for me and it is much, much better.<br /><br />Sound quality is also excellent. On the back of the phone, close to the bottom there is a row of pinholes to expose the speaker. The placement is fine but you have to be aware of it when using the phone for playing music as it is easy to cover the speaker holes with the hand inadvertently. So far I have found no issues with the quality of sound - everything is clear and mostly balanced.<br /><br />By far the very best feature of this phone is the camera. The back camera is a whopping 13MP which is the best I have seen in a phone. There are more capable smartphone cameras out there but the price differential between them and this phone is very large. The autofocus is very fast and seems to be very accurate and the phone offers many of the controls that I have on my SLR and point-and-shoot cameras (such as panorama, facial beauty, white balance and a lot more). The front camera is a more modest 5MB, but I remember my first digital camera being less than 3MP so I have a very difficult time finding fault with the lower megapixel rating. Both cameras do a good job of trying to adjust for low light though you can see some flickering when the light is sufficiently low. Picture quality is great and I love the ease of switching back and forth between the live camera and the filmstrip view. Even if you don't want to use this phone as a phone, the camera is worth the asking price on it's own merits.<br /><br />There are a couple of things about this phone that came as pleasant surprises. Included in the box is a screen protector shield which is a very unusual addition with a phone - normally these are purchased separately or they come with a phone case, so the inclusion is a very welcome addition. A bigger surprise in the box, though, is a pair of earbuds with a built-in micropohone. These earbuds are nothing special in terms of sound quality but they're certainly not unacceptable by any means. If you don't have a set of earbuds already, it is no longer a problem. Also in the box is a USB charging and sync cable - standard fare anymore.<br /><br />Another plus is the fact that this phone has a fingerprint scanner for access control. I have seen phones with this capability but this is the first one I have used and it seems to work fairly well. My fingers are a little wider than the scanner face so I have to be particular when I line up to swipe. Someone with smaller fingers will have an easier time.<br /><br />There is one thing not in the box that was a small surprise and that's an AC-to-USB adapter. I am not sure why one is not included but its absence is not a deal-breaker. I have a bunch of these so it's no big deal, but if you don't have one you will have to charge the phone by connecting to a computer instead.<br /><br />With that thought in mind I plugged this phone into my computer's USB port to see what my computer would do with it. Windows correctly recognized the phone as an Android phone and loaded up the MT65xx driver. I was able to locate it in the control panel but by default was unable to interact with it. I was able to enable shared storage though and could copy files between the computer and phone.<br /><br />One of the things Android phones are good at is running applications. This one works well and runs them *fast*. It has a quad-core processor and it smokes through games and other applications. There should be no problems with this phone and sluggishness with applications.<br /><br />I did discover that when I turned on the WiFi and looked for networks the phone could see and connect to my 2.4GHz network but not the 5GHz network. I inquired about this and was informed that the phone's WiFi adapter cannot operate at 5GHz. This is ok, but it is an important consideration when buying a phone with the intention of connecting to wireless networks. I also discovered something else - this phone is not capable of 4G connectivity but is limited to 3G and below. I would be more critical of this except that the phone is really inexpensive for everything else it provides.<br /><br />Call quality - so far I have had no issues. I can hear the person on the other end enough issue and so far no one has complained about the sound quality on my end. Phones tend to degrade over time and I am interested in seeing how well this one holds up. My record for a phone was a first-generation Droid which lasted 4 years, so I am anxious to see if this phone can match that.<br /><br />IRULU makes a good phone, loaded with features and priced very competitively. This phone is worth a look if you want a feature-packed phone and are on a more limited budget.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Better Built than the Average Monopod,"There are two different kinds of “selfie sticks” (also called monopods). Most are Bluetooth devices that connect to the phone and operate the phone shutter via remote in the handle. These monopods require occasional recharging though the battery life is lengthy. The other kind plugs into the audio jack of the phone and the button operates the shutter via wire. There is no battery and all power comes via the audio jack. This particular monopod is of the latter type and it works well, though I do have an Android phone that will not work properly with it (not unexpected, see below).<br /><br />This monopod is similar in design to most others; it is a telescoping rod with a base for attaching the harness on the end and it has a rubberized handle with a covered button. Where it differs, though, is in the quality of the rod which is a bit better than average and it is definitely sturdy enough to support the phone without bending. This actually needs to be emphasized as I have seen some monopods with very weak rods that flex a little too easily.<br /><br />The audio jack cable extends from under the base at the end of the rod and has some flex to it that allows it to attach to almost any size phone without too much trouble. Because the cable is coiled it will retract into the rod if the base is pulled off so exercise a little caution when extending. That said, the base is well attached so there should be no issue if the monopod is not abused.<br /><br />I tried this monopod with three devices. The first was a Windows Phone which is not listed amongst the supported devices, the second was a Kyocera phone running the right version of Android and the third was a Sony Xperia Z running Android. The Windows phone was a flop as expected, and when the button on the monopod was pressed it turned up the volume on the phone. With the Kyocera phone, pressing the button caused the image to zoom in. This is a problematic phone and has not worked with any monopod I have tried, Bluetooth or otherwise. With the Sony, the action worked as expected and pressing the button caused the shutter to snap. This is exactly the same behavior I have observed with these three devices and other monopods of this type. So, it is safe to say it works with a majority of Android phones and it does not work at all with the Windows phone. It was worth a try.<br /><br />This is a nice monopod, better than others of its type that I have used. It is more solidly build than average and has a good, firm telescoping rod and it is assembled well. If you want a monopod and you want/need to avoid Bluetooth, this is a fine choice.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,The Right Case for My Phone,"I carry a Nokia Lumia 822 phone and it has been a great phone. The problem is that it is not the most popular model of phone available and as a result it is difficult to find accessories for it. I used to have an Otter Box for it but that case completely fell apart. I tried the Incipio case and while it worked well enough it did not really cover the phone and had a tendency to slip off the right edge of the phone. I finally found the Trident Aegis case and decided to give it a try. I figured it is not an expensive case and in the worst case I am out a few dollars and have to keep looking. Fortunately, my search for a phone case has ended.<br /><br />This is a half-shell type of case that is a fusion of hard rubber for the edges and a hard plastic back that protects the back of the phone. The hard rubber provides enough cushion to protect against a good amount of drop shock but is pliable enough to allow getting the phone in and out of the case without a huge amount of effort. The case provides flaps to cover the audio and USB ports too, not enough to call it waterproof but enough to keep the majority of dust and dirt away.<br /><br />I like the fact that this case provides hard buttons similar to what the Otter Box provides. With some other cases I have tried I have had difficulty pushing the buttons on the sides because the case either got in the way or would not line up properly. This is not a problem for this case.<br /><br />I really appreciate the fact that this case includes a screen protector. Some cases to not come with a screen protector but this one comes with one that is easy to apply to the face of the phone. This particular screen protector is not going to be of much help for hard impact damage but it will prevent scratching and cutting of the screen in most cases. That’s good news for me as I have a bad habit of dropping my phone in the same pocket with my keys.<br /><br />I went with the blue version of the case which I expected to be a nice, electric blue. It is more of a turquoise color which is fine, just not quite what I expected.<br /><br />I have seen some other reviewers comment that this case doesn’t fit right? In my case it fits my phone almost perfectly.<br /><br />If you have a Nokia Lumia 822 phone, this is probably the best case available for it, better than even the Otter Box. It fits well, seems to be made nicely, it is attractive and it includes a screen protector. For the price, this is a great case. I wish I had started with this case - I never would have bought the Otter Box or the Incipio had I known about the Trident case.",1427050852000,4,True
5.0,Good Half-Shell Case with Bumper Guard,"A good cell phone case is a wise investment for any smartphone user. Even a cheap rubber sleeve case that costs very little provides some protection for that expensive phone, though better cases provide more and protect in different ways. The Iron Shield case by Verus is a very nice and attractive case that does a nice job of preventing drop damage, particularly around the edges.<br /><br />This case is different than most phone cases I have used in that it has a removable aluminum ring that runs around the edge of the case. The ring helps with corner and edge shocks and it also helps with keeping the case in place when protecting the phone. When snapping the phone into the case the ring is removed to allow the case more flexibility when inserting the phone and then the ring is reattached afterward.<br /><br />I have not really tried to test how well this case protects the phone but I did notice a couple of things. First, the ring adds some rigidity to the case so that when it’s in place the case is a lot less likely to twist, even when the phone is not in the case at the time. I also noticed that for corner and edge drops the ring takes the brunt of the impact. For a flat fall the case will protect the phone as long as it lands on the back; if the phone is dropped on the face, particularly on a surface like a gravel driveway or other hard textured surface, the case can’t really offer a lot.<br /><br />The one thing I wish this case included is a screen protector. Some cases come with a plastic scratch-resistant sheet that applies to the face of the phone and while it is of little use for impact damage it is good for scratch prevention. Most cases anymore don’t seem to include such which is unfortunate.<br /><br />The case fits the phone very nicely and properly exposes the audio and USB ports as well as the camera.<br /><br />Overall this is a nice case that provides good protection for an LG G3 phone. The metal bumper guard adds impact protection to the sides and corner of the phone where it is needed most. It looks nice, too, which is an added bonus.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

4.0,Improves 3G Coverage Adequately Over a Small Area,"The cell signal in our house is good everywhere except in the basement, which is partially finished. I have put together a home office down there so I spend a good deal of time in the basement and when I receive a call it gets a little spotty due to the reduced reception. When I do get a data connection it is often 1X and unreliable. Connecting to the WiFi network resolves the data issue but it does not help the call quality nor does it reduce dropped calls. I looked to this booster kit to help improve the connectivity and reception in the basement and it does work; however, it requires some planning when setting up and it may not be the right fit for your configuration depending on the coverage you need.<br /><br />First, it is important to understand that this is a 3G booster and has limited use with current 4G/LTE phones. If you have a 4G phone, you are better off with the 4G version so you can get the benefit of the 4G speed boost, not just call quality improvements.<br /><br />The unit consists of an indoor box that handles processing, an indoor antenna and an outdoor antenna. This requires some planning and coordination. The two antennas require some distance apart to work properly or they interfere with one another a little, so planning ahead is going to help the install go smoother. The higher up you can place the outdoor antenna the better. Because I wanted the unit in the basement and I wanted the best possible signal, this meant mounting the outdoor antenna at a much higher point on the house. The indoor antenna is a directional one and it requires a little planning as well – don’t point at the outdoor antenna and decide where you want to place this antenna to maximize the coverage in the room.<br /><br />Double-paned windows are not your friend when it comes to this unit. The glass interferes with the signal and prevents the unit from really working properly.<br /><br />Once everything was all connected and the unit configured properly, I went to the furthest area of the basement where the signal is typically weakest and almost always fails over to 1X. I turned off the WiFi and let the phone figure out what to do. After a short time, it picked up the 3G signal and was usable. It wasn’t a particularly strong signal but it was enough to make stable phone calls with good quality and no drops so far. This particular unit is designed for small area coverage like a room or two, so if you need full house coverage consider one of the other units that offers a stronger signal and better range.<br /><br />For boosting 3G coverage over a small area (a room or two), this unit seems to work fairly well. Installation requires some pre-planning, and the signal strength is not super-strong, but it’s good for correcting holes in coverage in a home.",1424366137000,1,False
5.0,Stylish iPhone 5S Wallet Case,"I have not used wallet cases in the past, having stuck with Otter Boxes and other similar cases that provide good protection on all sides of the phone but little on the glass face. Most cases come with a plastic shield that protects the glass from scratches but few offer any kind of impact protection. This wallet case is the first case I have used that actually does protect the face of the phone, and so far I am very pleased with it.<br /><br />Out of the box, this is a nice-looking and sturdy phone holder. It opens like a small book with the hard plastic holder on the right and a place for a couple of credit cards or a driver’s license on the left. The phone snaps into place without any difficulty and the case holds it securely but not so tightly that it cannot be easily removed. The plastic portion has the holes in the right spot so that the phone can be used as a camera or a music device without having to remove it from the case. Overall, it is a well thought-put design.<br /><br />When closed, the case protects the face of the phone from most simple impacts. If dropped and the phone hits something just right it can shatter the glass, but with this case protecting the phone the leather absorbs many of those impacts and keeps the glass from taking the brunt of an impact.<br /><br />Aside from protecting the phone, this is a very stylish and attractive phone case that somewhat resembles a new brown leather wallet. It is far and away the most attractive case I have ever had for a phone. As a bonus it does not add appreciable bulk to the phone.<br /><br />As mentioned, the case has a place for credit cards facing the phone and this just strikes me funny. I have demagnetized hotel room keys with my phone by getting it too close to them and I have been very gun shy about putting my phone close to anything magnetic since. However, the pocket for cards is just right for a driver’s license, business cards or even a small amount of cash. There is a small magnet in the case on the flap side too that works to gently hold the case closed. So far I have not encountered any issues with this magnet interfering with the phone but again I would be hesitant to put in a card with a magnetic stripe. Perhaps I am just a little paranoid.<br /><br />This is a really nice phone case, more attractive than most and it protects the phone a little more completely than other cases I have used due to the leather flap that closes over the face of the phone. I hesitate to put anything with a magnetic stripe in the pocket but the pocket has other uses that make it very useful anyway. Overall, I think this case is excellent and am happy to recommend it.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Cell Phone Bike Mount/Tablet Mount - a Combined Review,"This review is a little different than most I have written in that it covered two products at once. Amazon will not allow two reviews against the same listing, and sometimes multiple products are grouped under the same listing. In order to review both, both products have to be combined in the same review. I received both the bike mount and the tablet mount for testing and review, so I have combined them into this one review. This is possible because they are both excellent products and I would give them the same rating separately. I will review the bike mount first, followed by the tablet mount.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Cell Phone Bike Mount:<br /><br />A bike mount is a specialty item useful to those who spend a lot of time on a bike, for commuting, touring or running trails. It is important to get a good one if you’re going to invest in a mount for your bike, in particular if you are planning to hit the trails off-road. I have come to associate AVANTEK with inexpensive but high-quality electronics and accessories so my expectations were very high for this bike mount. It has not let me down. I did find one minor concern with it that is worth mentioning.<br /><br />I will start with the price - $15.99 as I write this (please be aware that the price can change at some point). There are less expensive bike mounts available but you likely will not find one as good at even a higher price. For the money this is about as well-made and thoughtfully designed mount available.<br /><br />My main cell phone is a Nokia Lumia and I was able to get it to fit in the bracket absolutely perfectly. The bracket is a slider type that adjusts to accommodate just about any cell phone available. There is a latch on the back so that when the bracket is adjusted just right it can be locked into place. It also has a supplementary band to add additional security to keep the phone from coming loose. When I put my phone in the bracket, it did fit but not perfectly until I removed it from it’s normal protective case. This may prove to be a problem for some but at the same time consider that the mount is a form of protection in its own right and you’re not going to drop the phone when it’s in this bracket.<br /><br />With my phone in the harness I picked up the phone mount and shook it very vigorously in an effort to shake my phone free. It did not let my phone escape in this very unrealistic test but it did tell me I can count on this harness to hold my phone securely no matter what kind of terrain I encounter.<br /><br />The clamp that attaches to the handlebar is probably the most impressive part of this whole mount. It works in principle like a pair of vice grip pliers and once tightened has a latch on it that holds it just a little tighter in place and it prevents the clamp from loosening up. The harness clips on to this clamp and snaps into place so it will not shake loose. The base where the harness attaches actually swivels so the phone can be mounted almost anywhere on the bike (within reason).<br /><br />This is an impressive bike mount and you likely will not find one that’s better for even close to the same amount of money. It is very well made, it holds the phone very securely and is very affordable. If you want a phone mount for your phone to go on your bike, give this mount a look.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Tablet Mount:<br /><br />Many people use GPS devices and mobile phones as navigation devices in vehicles. There is no reason that an adequately connected tablet cannot serve the same purpose except that tablets are usually larger and more difficult to secure. Avantek's tablet windshield mount answers this need, though caution is advised when using it due to the size of device for which it is designed. That said, I have found an interesting non-vehicular use for this mount that makes it more useful to me.<br /><br />The mounting harness itself accommodates larger tablets, up to 10&#34;, by employing spring-loaded arms that slide out to allow a larger tablet to fit. Each arm is capped with a molded rubber corner that holds the tablet in place without slipping. The harness also has hard rubber padding that further keeps the tablet in place and reduces play in the grip. When using this mounting solution it is very unlikely that a tablet will come loose.<br /><br />The mount has two jointed connections, one a straight hinge and one a limited-range ball joint, that allows positioning the tablet just right. The ball joint moves smoothly and has infinite angles of positioning. The hinge joint is graduated and with each point (approximately 30) in the joint the position clicks audibly. This type of hinged joint is less prone to slipping, even when not completely tightened.<br /><br />The suction cup on this mounting bracket is one of the largest I have seen. When attached to a glass surface it holds tightly with excellent suction. I suspect that, like all other suction cups I have ever used, it will &#34;let go&#34; when mounted on a cold glass surface, though I am optimistic that it will hold longer than smaller cups.<br /><br />I have one reservation about mounting this to the windshield for a tablet. A large tablet mounted like this will, if not placed properly, interfere with visibility. That said, I was able to position my tablet in such a way as to not appreciably impact my view of the road. I would recommend not using this mount with a 10&#34; tablet in a vehicle with a more narrow field of view out the windshield.<br /><br />I found an alternate use for this bracket that has worked out well for me. Instead of using it in the car, I use the bracket in my home office by mounting it to the window next to my desk. This makes my tablet a lot more accessible without taking up any desk space, it still allows me to grab the tablet and move with it and it allows me to operate the tablet as an appliance while still having my computer up and running at the same time.<br /><br />This is a nice bracket for mounting a tablet that works well. It holds the tablet securely, it adjusts for just about any angle and it holds larger tablets in place. Caution should be used when mounting with a larger tablet to the windshield but when mounted to avoid interfering with visibility it opens up the ability to use the tablet as a GPS (data plan permitting).<br /><br />---<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided samples of these products in exchange for fair, honest and thorough reviews.

5.0,Very Convenient USB Charger; Consider Size when Placing,"With multiple electronic devices that require a USB port for charging, it's easy to run out of places to plug in. One solution is to use a powered USB hub but I have not found one that is able to keep up when plugging in multiple devices for charging - more devices means more power required. Myoho's 4-port charger is a good solution to this problem, but it has one possible negative point that's worth consideration, though it is not a showstopper.<br /><br />This charger provides a total of 4 ports, two of which provide 2.4 amps (""PowerCharger"" ports) and 2 that provide 1.2 amps (""Universal"" ports). I plugged my tablet and my GPS in the PowerCharger ports and my phone in one of the Universal ports and the charger kept up without breaking a sweat. This one charger easily replaces four on my desk - this is a great benefit, as I have limited plugs on my power brick and frequently have to play games with my plugs to charge things up.<br /><br />I found only one issue that merits mention and that issue depends on where this charger is plugged in. This is a fairly large adapter and because of the placement of the 110V outlet prongs the charger can block the other socket when plugged into a 2-socket wall outlet, regardless of which socket is used in the pair. This is particularly a problem when the other device being plugged in has a ground prong and the insulation molded around the prongs is thick. A plug that has no ground prong, like a lamp, is unlikely to cause any issue. Whether this is a worthwhile tradeoff is something that should be considered. If there are two chargers already taking up the outlets, this is a wonderful trade. In my specific case this is actually irrelevant as I have it on a power brick where the sockets are offset enough to compensate.<br /><br />Myoho has put together a great USB 4-port charger. It does a fine job of charging USB devices quickly and in parallel.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,"Great For Charging My Tablet, Excellent Data Rate","Most USB cables are no-name cables that serve a basic purpose. The manufacturer does not put any indicator of who manufactured it on the cable (though the packaging sometimes does) so when a cable fails, it is simply replaced. This cable is different in that Myoho saw fit to put their name right on the cable and warranty the cable for a year. That's a good indicator that they stand behind their product. My experience with this cable has been brief but so far I am quite pleased.<br /><br />This is a very unassuming cable, simple black casing and molding on the plugs and the Myoto name and USB logo printed on either end the of the cable. However, this is the heaviest gauge microUSB cable I have ever used. I have had at least one of these types of cables come apart and degrade (came with a Nokia phone), but I doubt this will be an issue with this cable.<br /><br />I decided to use this cable with my tablet, a Sony Xperia Z tablet that is particular about the cable used to charge it and sync with my laptop. The fact that it works with my tablet is a huge plus right out of the box. I noticed two things about this cable when compared to the cable that came with my tablet: it allows my tablet to charge faster than the provided cable, even when powered on, and it facilitates excellent connectivity between my computer and tablet, again achieving a better data rate than the provided cable. This cable is now permanently assigned to my tablet.<br /><br />The full retail on this cable is $15 as I write this and that's a little higher than the average cable (it is selling for lower here on Amazon as I write this, though). That said, I see few manufacturers back their cables with a warranty nor take enough pride in their work to put the company name right on the product. All indicators so far are that I am very unlikely to need the warranty coverage and considering that it allows for faster charging and faster connectivity between my laptop and my tablet that's worth the slightly higher price.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

4.0,Decent Stylus,"We have a couple of computers with touch screens as well as a tablet so a stylus for touch screens is very much something we can use. Having worked with a Wacom Intuos5 for a while I thought I knew what to expect. I was right in some ways and wrong in others. Overall, this is a nice stylus.<br /><br />This is a small and lightweight stylus. Having hands like a gorilla I expected this to be a little too small for my hands but it's actually quite comfortable. It's a little shorter than a typical ink pen but it's about the same width as a standard wooden pencil, so it will be comfortable for most hands. This is a plus right off the bat.<br /><br />I expected this stylus to have a soft rubber tip, and I was partially right. The tip is covered is a fine mesh weave which should make it glide a little more freely across a glass surface. Some thought went into the tip.<br /><br />On our tablet (a Sony Xperia Z) we had no issues with this stylus at all except in the learning curve involved in touching the screen with something other than a finger. We had no trouble in using it to navigate the web, open and manipulate applications and more. So far, so good.<br /><br />I decided to try the stylus on my laptop with a drawing application and I encountered the only real issue I have with it. As I dragged it across the surface, unless I bore down on it, it would skip often. I am still trying to figure out why this is the case - the tip should almost eliminate all of the skipping. Turning the stylus such that the tip's weave is parallel to the direction of movement helps with this but does not completely eliminate the behavior.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a good stylus that works well as a pointing device, especially for those with large fingers that could use a little help with pinpointing things in the screen. I am a little less enthusiastic about it as an art tool but it is workable in that regard.",1409881820000,15,False
4.0,Works Better for Holding Post-It Notes than Cell Phone,"We have a million pens and pencils all over the house and we have them in assorted cups, bins and drawers, so a pencil cup is a very useful item in my house. This particular pencil holder is designed to also be a cell phone holder. It does a poor job of this but is much better suited for sticky notes which makes more sense anyway.<br /><br />I like the weighting of this cup. It has a heavy base which makes it more stable when it is loaded up, which in turn makes it a lot less likely to tip over and spill its contents everywhere.<br /><br />I also like the size of this cup. There is enough room for a set of magic markers or dry erase markers, with a little room left over. In addition, there is a small space for the likes of paper clips or push pins which is a very nice thing – most pencil cups do not have such and if you put small items like paper clips in you have to dump the cup to get to them.<br /><br />The issue with this cup is actually the fact that it’s touted as a cell phone holder. Please, do not waste your time with this if you want it for holding your phone. While it will hold a cell phone and there is a place for the cord while the phone is on the cup, anything other than the smallest phone will block access to the pens and pencils unless you turn the cup. It seems silly. Instead, the place intended for a phone is much better suited for a square of sticky notes which fit nearly perfectly. Having a supply of sticky notes along with the pens and pencils makes good sense.<br /><br />This is not a bad pencil cup and it is very useful. There are some thoughtful features that have been implemented on this cup. However, it is ill-suited for holding a cell phone as advertised – instead consider using it for small note pads or sticky notes which usually are no far from a pen cup anyway.",1409055413000,0,False
3.0,Good Phone With a Few Negative Behaviors,"I have been a Verizon customer for several years and I had a first generation Droid for many of those years. I have used phones from Samsung, Motorola, LG and Nokia but up until this point I have never used a Kyocera phone. I was interested in trying the Hydro Elite, and so far my experience has been middle-of-the-road - there are some areas for improvement.<br /><br />First things first - I received the phone through the Vine program and it did NOT come with the SIM card. This is probably because it was not a purchased phone but is an evaluation handset. The phone does not come with service right out of the box, it has to be activated and a SIM card is needed for that. People buying a service plan should get a card. People (like me) who are already on Verizon and already have a smart phone will have a card in their old phones which can be used in this new phone. The SIM card itself does not make the card work, it needs the data written on it. Verizon customers (new and existing) will get what they need to activate this phone, so if you buy this phone and subscribe to a plan you'll have a card in it when it arrives.<br /><br />I took the SIM card out of my current phone, popped it into the Hydro Elite and powered it on. It immediately connected to the network, acquired my phone number and activated itself. Within just a couple of minutes, it was ready to go.<br /><br />The Hydro Elite is a petite Android phone, smaller than most other smart phones I have seen. Very curvy and smooth, it is similar in looks to an iPhone, but it's actually an Android-based offering. It's a tight and solid little device, built to handle a little moisture and some jostling.<br /><br />I particularly like the brightness and clarity of the screen. In spite of being slightly smaller than other smart phones I have used, the screen is very clear and crisp.<br /><br />One of the main complaints I have seen regarding this phone is about call quality. I think the call clarity is acceptable although I have used clearer and better-sounding hand sets in the past. It has the very slight sound of talking in a tunnel or in a can, though I have to look for this in order to really mind it much. The volume is fine too and can be adjusted. That all said, the sound quality when the speaker phone is used is mediocre at best.<br /><br />My first issue occurred when I tried to connect to my wireless network. It located it, allowed me to put in my security key, and then constantly insisted the network was out of range - even when I was three feet from the router. I deleted the connection, put it in again and the problem is gone. I suspect I entered the key in incorrectly, but I never received a message as such.<br /><br />The next issue I ran into involves the Verizon stuff installed on it. Once I connected to the wireless network I get a very persistent message that appears about Verizon's location service sending a large number of SMS messages. I have not yet figured out the silver bullet to make this stop and it interferes with everything I try to do on this phone. I am sure there is some way to make this quit happening but I have not found it yet. I don't care if the application sends SMS data or not - I just don't want to hear about it every 10-15 seconds (yes, it's that persistent). This is not Kyocera's fault - this is Verizon's issue, and for me this is absolutely unacceptable.<br /><br />I use my phone in my car every day and my car is set up to allow Bluetooth phones to connect to it for voice commands and hands-free operation. Connecting the Hydro Elite was very simple and I had no difficulty connecting the two. However, one thing that did not happen was that the phone book never downloaded and I could not call anyone by voice command. This is an inconvenience and is probably not entirely Kyocera's fault, but I have not figured out how to get the car's system to see the phone book which was automatic with other phones I have used. I can still use the dashboard buttons to dial, but that's not ideal.<br /><br />This is not that bad of a phone. It's actually a nice little phone and it works pretty well. I love the screen and it's an attractive little device. However, it has some issues with implementation that make it a little harder to recommend.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/30/13: Following the suggestion of a fellow reviewer, I allowed the phone to connect to the Play store and updated the VZ Security application and this solved the issue with the persistent message about SMS data. It is unfortunate that Verizon's application made it out the door in this state but I am glad it has been fixed. From the message that would appear, it was not at all clear that the security application was behind the issue. I am leaving the rating at 3 stars for now.",1382497666000,0,False
4.0,Elegant Device With A Few Quirks,"I moved to a Lumia 822 Windows Phone after having had a first generation Droid for several years. I was happy with my Droid and it worked well, but after it finally started to degrade it was time to move to a new phone. I decided to try the Windows phone platform for no reason other than wanting something different, and of the options available to me I was most impressed with the Lumia 822. I wish I had made this switch a while ago...<br /><br />The Lumia is a larger phone than my original Droid, and I was a little apprehensive when I bought it because of this. My concern was that it would be bulky and would be cumbersome to use, but this has not been the case. It fits almost perfectly in a pants pocket and it is just the right size when in operation for comfortable talk. It is large enough to allow for talking into the actual receiver instead of relying on the way someone holds the phone which means consistent sound clarity for the person on the other end.<br /><br />Call quality has been great. So far I have had no issues with the ability to speak and be heard in a call. In fact, when switching between speaker phone and regular calling mode the person on the other end has said that they cannot always tell the difference. This was an unexpected bonus - most phones I have used do not work as well as speaker phones.<br /><br />It is important to understand that this phone does not have a standard physical QWERTY keyboard but instead has a virtual keyboard that it displays on the screen. This is becoming the norm anymore, though I personally prefer having a phone that has a physical fly-out keyboard. In use, the keyboard works fairly well though I have occasional issues with tapping the right keys as I have larger fingers which means that sometimes the phone registers the wrong button pressed. This is more the exception than the rule but it happens often enough to merit attention - if you have larger hands, be aware that typing can get a little frustrating if you're in a hurry.<br /><br />The greatest difficulty I have had with this phone is when using it with the car. I have a Ford Focus with full Sync system, and my Droid worked flawlessly with it. The Lumia works almost as well, though I have had the same problem many have had - when making an outbound call the system can shift into privacy mode and no one on either end hears anything. I have found that by using the phone to dial instead of using voice or the dashboard keypad the problem can be completely avoided but this is inconvenient. Recently my phone downloaded a large update and since then it seems to be working more consistently - time will tell if this has truly fixed the issue, but for now I have an acceptable workaround.<br /><br />Now, about Windows 8 on the phone... I am not a huge fan of Windows on the normal (non-touchscreen) computer, but on a touchscreen phone it seems like this is the way a phone should work. The Windows phone OS is very intuitive, easy to use and it just works. I love the tile-based screens. With my Droid I occasionally had issues where I somehow scrolled to a different screen and got icons messed up because of it; I have not had any issues of that kind with the Windows OS and so far am absolutely pleased. The one drawback I have with the platform is that once in a great while the phone will simply reboot without warning - never during a call (so far) but always unexpected. To be fair, I had the same problem with Android at about the same frequency, but it still needs to be mentioned.<br /><br />As at least one other reviewer mentioned, the number of apps in the online store is small compared to the quantity of apps in the Android or iPhone store. So far I have had no problem finding applications to suit my needs. There are more applications being added all the time but the problem is that the market share does not favor the Windows phone. The biggest targets are Android and iOS and that is where the majority of the applications are found right now.<br /><br />There is one application that I have been unable to find that I think is sorely needed - a reputable security suite. As I write this I have found none at all. I have looked at Norton and Kaspersky in particular for applications of this type and they do not support Windows 8 on the phone. To me, this is a big deal. There are partial solutions in the store but so far I have not found an antivirus or anything else that would be termed good mobile security. I do sincerely hope this is corrected soon. This is not a shortcoming of the phone itself; rather, it is a reflection of the Windows 8 mobile market share.<br /><br />The Lumia 822 is not without its quirks and issues but overall it is a very nice phone. It has a good feature set, it is easy to use and it's the right size for me. When it eventually dies, I will likely get something similar.",1368789860000,1,False
4.0,Satisfied So Far With Only Minor Complaints,"I have been using Kaspersky Mobile Security on my Droid phone for the better part of the year. I decided on Kaspersky because I use Pure 2.0 on my home network computers and am very pleased with it. So far, Kaspersky's Mobile Security (just Mobile Security from here forward) has given me only minor issues.<br /><br />Installation was a minor event and did not take too terribly long from start to finish. After loading to my phone and installing itself, Mobile Security presented me the requisite welcome and options screens for setting up everything. I was able to set up my password first then manage all of my settings after which the package was ready to go to work for me.<br /><br />After I finished all of my configurations the application has quietly sat in the background. It is rare that it lets me know that anything is happening, though when it feels the need to request input it does so with a full-screen dialog box.<br /><br />Probably a function of my phone's hardware, scans of the system tend to be slow. This really does not bother me, but it's something to consider. More interesting through is that Mobile Security is always doing something in the background, evidenced by the occasional messages about applications passing scans.<br /><br />I have SMS and number blocking set up on my phone and this is one of the areas where I have found that Mobile Security is not right. When I receive an SMS message, it comes through, *after* which I get a dialog from Mobile Security asking if I want to block the number. This seems a little bit backward. I would rather be given the option to reject a message from an unknown number before I see the message at all. Also, the dialog can be dismissed without touching the screen, simply by touching the back button. This is true for calls and messages. Now, once a number is blacklisted or whitelisted, there's never another dialog about that particular number ever again.<br /><br />The most irritating thing that Mobile Security has done was to advertise an update but then would fail to download said update. I got messages repeatedly for weeks about an update and I was not able to successfully update Mobile Security until it finally worked. The update, when it finally downloaded successfully, installed itself quickly and so far has had no observable impact on my phone.<br /><br />Other reviewers have complained of international text message charges, but so far I have not had any of this happening to me. The charges have been unchanging and very consistent. I am not sure if the problem others have seen is a function of having something turned on/off or being on a particular network.<br /><br />Resource usage seems to be low with Mobile Security. I monitor available memory closely and I watch battery strength and have not observed any outrageous resource usage since installing Mobile Security. This may vary by architecture but I have no other units against which to test.<br /><br />Important to me is the ability to use my phone as a tethering device on occasion. I was worried that Mobile Security might interfere. Fortunately, it has not.<br /><br />I have no idea what will happen if Mobile Security finds an issue. It has found nothing amiss since I have loaded it.<br />So far, Kaspersky Mobile Security has worked to my satisfaction. It does have a couple of minor quirks with it that can be irritating but so far I haven't seen any real issues. In my experience it's competent security.",1350514374000,1,False

5.0,Fits My A71 5G Perfectly!,Love this wallet phone case. Have hand issues and feel more secure with this than any other type of case.  Never feel like I am going to drop my phone.  Has place for several cards plus a zippered change section which is where I put the cards I need to pull out often-just easier for me.  All buttons line up and are functional.  Very nice quality.  Has a strong strap to hold everything together when closed. Would buy again and definitely would recommend!!,1666027630880,0,True
5.0,Love This Phone!,First off I did my research and purchased during prime day and got very lucky as this phone A71 5G was discounted on the 2nd day. I love the speed of the 5G that I get with T-mobile. Blazing fast compared to 4LTE. 128GB memory which I forgot to purchase (my mistake not the seller's as it stated it wasn't included but this was my first time purchasing an unlocked smartphone).  Delivered ahead of schedule which was great. No scratches or blemishes on the phone at all. This is my 2nd renowned purchase and both were Samsung Galaxy products that were in like new condition.  I would definitely not hesitate to go this route again. Very satisfied.  I also went with the optional drop protection for the screen.  Company is great to work with and it is emailed to you. No issues with the phone so far. If I do I will update. This specific phone was locked to T-mobile which was not an issue for me as that is my carrier.  I would just make sure before purchasing you ck with your carrier to make sure it is compatible with them.,1661719670141,0,False
5.0,Great Value Excellent Shape!,Love my new A71 5g refurbished phone.  When I received it I couldn't believe it was reowned as it didn't look like it had been used before.  Just a few minor issues that I am working with T-mobile with.  My current sim card is too small to fit into the card holder so they are sending me a new one out and was unaware that I needed to purchase the memory card seperately. Other than that this is a great phone and considering I am upgrading from a Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime with only 16g of memory to 128g of memory this phone will last me 5+ years like my J7 did.  Definitely recommend this!!,1660595780064,0,False

So far absolutely no issues even for me with limited movement and strength in my hands.  Pink case that mine snapped into,  optional hand strap,  secure strap for keeping your phone locked in place.  One thing to remember,  check your phone or model number to make sure that this cover will fit.

5.0,Perfect.,"I use amFilm for all my modern screens. I use it on my phone, my wife uses it on hers, our daughter's iPad, our Switch--you name it. When I ordered my Pocket from the initial pre-order, I didn't order anything else, regrettably. Looking back, I wish I would've ordered the screen protector and GG adapter, but I was in such a rush to get my pre-order locked.<br />I digress.<br /><br />What I love about amFilm is I get two quality glass screens at an incredibly reasonable price. When amFilm first posted the protectors, they were 9.99 USD for a pack; just a few days later, when I placed my order, the price increased to 11.99 USD. But even at the 2 USD increase, the price is more than justified. The pack comes with the usual: two glass screens, screen-cleaning supplies, and an installation guide. The latter may seem trivial, but I've always referred to it to ensure I get proper installation. Since the time I received the Pocket, I kept the factory plastic protector on the screen. When I was ready to apply the amFilm protector, I simply removed the plastic screen and applied the amFilm protector within seconds. The protector comes with two removable, plastic tabs on either side to aid in application. So far, no noticeable dust or particles. Sweet.<br /><br />The screen protector is so smooth it feels like water. With other devices like the Switch and our mobile devices, this sheen doesn't last long due to constant interaction with skin. I hope, at least, that the Pocket's silky-smooth layer stays on longer. I notice no difference in color between the previous plastic protector and this amFilm one. The edges are rounded off, which looks very handsome on the Pocket. It's like a bubble flattened as much as possible without popping. Nice.",1646754536072,1,False
4.0,Charges and cleans great!,"- Charging<br />The charging feature of this device works great for our Note8 and iPhone Xr.

I really like that it's got a slim profile, so it doesn't take up a lot of airspace on my dresser. The materials used are robust and make the device feel solid. The cable is a bit short, but at least it's a fast-charging cable and base.<br /><br />- UV sanitizer<br />With the pandemic, being as clean as possible is highly important. Sanitizers obviously have become popular, and what gadget needs to be cleaned as frequently as the phone? The sanitizer hopefully works well. At least this device has an actual UV light; other sanitizers I've tried have just a blue- or purple-colored light.

I was always wary of getting these vent mounts as I wasn't sure how the heat or AC would affect the phone, but alas this seemed the best option for our current car. The dash isn't as flat to accommodate a dash mount, so this will have to do.<br /><br />So far it fits my Note8 and my wife's Xr (both with Otterboxes) just fine. I'm able to take it off and put it on with ease. What I really like is that the release button is in the back; with our previous one, the release button was on the side.

I retightened it and it seems very sturdy now, but I will wait and see.<br /><br />You have to assemble it when it arrives, but if you used multiple mounts in the past it's just like the others: just pop the socket onto the ball joint and tighten it.

5.0,First-time Otterbox owner. Very satisfied.,"It's not that I've never wanted to own an Otterbox; I have. I just have had other cases that fit the specific phones better. I haven't had an iPhone in a while, and the Otterboxes seemed to have perfected that line of phones while Androids are hit and miss. Finally, as I have my Note8, I am able to encase my device with an Otterbox case. I was wondering if the curved screen of my device would be obstructed or cause any interference with the case, but alas it does not!<br /><br />I have a &#34;skin&#34; type screen protector on mine, and it covers the entire screen area. The Otterbox Commuter case does not interfere with it, thankfully. It reaches where it needs to at the bottom and at the sides, and nothing more.<br /><br />The case itself feels nice. It's a nice, matted texture on the hard plastic with a softer, almost rubber-like texture on the inner case. They go on surprisingly easy and didn't interfere with my plastic screen protector. The case I had on before was a Spigen Tough Armor. Spigen is always my default case because they provide aesthetically pleasant cases at a reasonable price, and are usually some of the first to arrive on the scene of a new phone. That case, unfortunately, ate a bit of the screen protector at the bottom. I had a hard time trying to tuck it back in, but it never would.<br />With this case, the bottom lips covers that area perfectly, so no more trying to tuck it back in.<br /><br />It feels great in the hand. The textured main case, while textured, is a bit smooth so it does sometimes feel as though it will sleep out of the fingers if carried loosely. But it's very snug to the form of the phone and doesn't really add much bulk. I used to be a proponent of fatter phones. The phone I had previously was the S5 and I had the Anker battery case, which pretty much tripled the thickness of the phone and quadrupled the weight. I was fine with it because it felt comfortable in the hands, especially when playing games, but it got to be too heavy after long sessions so I opted to use a phone ring with it.<br />With this case, the edges are nice and rounded enough to fit comfortably in the hand, and the size of the phone makes it easier to hold comfortably in adult hands for long sessions, even while remaining relatively thin.<br /><br />I like the color; a nice, deep navy, but I wish it came with more color combinations. I prefer a pop to my phone, but what can you do?<br /><br />Very satisfied with my first Otterbox. I like that the volume keys are separated from the Bixby button, making it much easier to press the volume buttons and avoid pressing the Bixby inadvertently.",1516297964869,0,False

If I were to put anything else in the slots, the wristlet would not close. This will be great to use on a night out when you don't want to carry many items with you, but be prepared to only carry 1-3 cards inside.

4.0,Nice band for working out,"My family recently got a membership to our local YMCA in an effort to get more fit 😬 I thought this would be a good addition to my workout routines since I am incapable of working out without some sort of distraction (e.g., music). I've only used it while on the elliptical or treadmill so I don't have experience using this band during any other type of exercise. It is easy to put on and take it off. I've used it a few times so far and it's held up great.  I will continue to use it and if it deteriorates over time, I will modify my review to reflect that.",1489359776000,0,False
4.0,Slim and durable case.,"Great product. Definitely slim fitting, which is a feature I was looking for, but feels very secure and sturdy. When you rest the phone screen side down, cover leaves the phone a bit raised to protect your screen from damage. Open access to all ports and buttons are easy to push through the case. The camera cutout is a bit big, though, and the cutouts for the bottom are handy compared to ones that have the bottom sides covered.<br /><br />On some styles it might seem that the case is two separate pieces but it's actually one (from what I can tell on my red one).<br />Color is true to the picture.",1484753523000,0,False
5.0,Durable phone case,This is a great case for my new iPhone 7. I'm a big fan of the Otterbox brand and have had great success with previous Otterbox cases for my other phones. This case is not any different. It's durable and the colors are vibrant. It's easy to put on the phone. It's a bit of a challenge to get the phone out of the case but I see that as a positive. I've already dropped my phone three times and the case has protected the phone. Definitely recommend,1484598710000,0,False
4.0,"A bit light, but works wonderfully.","Always good to have a few styli to try. This one is very lightweight, but has good balance toward the bottom, which is important. Because of its length, it has about the same amount of weight as a normal pencil, with maybe just a teeny bit more. It won't let you write on the tablet or phone unless you turn it on, so charging is a must.<br />The felt tip attracts some small wandering fabrics, but they're easily removable. From the looks of it alone, the stylus might become worn over time, but they do sell replacements (at least I'm assuming they do considering they show you how to replacement in the included instructions).<br /><br />So far I like it a lot, especially the weight. That said, I can't help but feel it's a bit cheap in construction, but I guess only time will tell. Or maybe I'm just thinking that because of how light it is compared to my other styli.",1469766527000,0,False
5.0,Lovin' it so far.,"Of course, in order to use this properly you need to have the phone directly connected to the case it comes with. I've had several arm bands before and that's never been a problem. I have a battery case that comes off fairly quickly, so I'm glad that I'm able to use my phone for music and track my jogging when I'm doing my run every other day.<br /><br />The band fits securely on my arm, but like with all elastic we'll see how long this holds up. Usually they've lasted me no more than a few years of regular use, and they've all been Belkin! :)<br /><br />The iPhone 6 snaps on the band pretty snugly, yet it's easy to pull out and remove without much force, so I don't think I'll go accidentally breaking the clip like I did on a couple of others. Of course, it's a bit heavier than my others but that's because of the actual phone, which is the heaviest I own so far.",1441339256000,0,False
3.0,Works great with my Galaxy S5; not so great with my iPad 2.,"The only other stylus for touchscreens I've owned was a $10, so that's the only basis I can go off of. I've been wanting to own a ""premium"" stylus with more accuracy, so I was pretty giddy when this came in the mail.<br /><br />The first thing I tried it on was my Galaxy S5. I know this stylus is touted for the iOS devices, but I wanted to give it a shot anyway. The phone wouldn't recognize the pen, so I enabled Touch Sensitivity and sure enough the stylus worked like any other stylus.<br /><br />Next, I tried it on my iPad 2. I turned on Bluetooth, but the iPad won't detect the stylus. I followed the instructions to the dot, but I'm not sure what the issue is. It could be the stylus, it could be the iPad; I'm guessing it may be my iPad. I'm going to keep trying.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I downloaded two free apps to try it out. Photoshop was one of them as I like to have a doodle app to fiddle with. There was a slight split-second delay between my drawing and when the iPad registered it. That, and the line on the iPad was slightly lower. I'm guessing that once I connect the Bluetooth properly it may be better, but that's what I'm stuck with for now.<br /><br />Immediately after that, I tried it on my S5 again. It worked flawlessly, and I didn't have to turn on Touch Sensitivities. I should note that I have a glass screen protector on my S5 and a plastic one (Otterbox) on my iPad. Not sure whether they make a difference, but it seems important to point that out.<br /><br />Overall, I'm satisfied with the stylus, but considering the price range I can't recommend it. The tip doesn't stay firm. It slides in a little bit when you press against the screen, though that could be how more accurate styli are. That, and the features the stylus promotes (app connectivity, Evernote, Bluetooth) don't work for me as well as they should, if at all.",1437600000000,0,False
2.0,Two-foot drop renders it useless. Too expense for what it is.,"When I had an iPhone 5 I had a Belkin battery case that worked great. Sure, the battery life lost its longevity over time, but I never had an issue with it breaking or damaging my iPhone. When I upgraded to an iPhone 6 I knew I had to get a battery case because there was no way I was going to live without one!<br /><br />I was offered a chance to get this and didn't hesitate.<br /><br />When it arrived I immediately loved the way it felt. I'm not sure what the material is, but it has a soft feel to it that makes it easy to grip. There are patterns on the back that run diagonal that also aid to its usability.<br />I initially found the &#34;security&#34; features to be a bit cheesy, but then grew to like them over time. The physical security features are basically just a slider to cover the two cameras. At first I though it unnecessary, but then I realized I often slid the the cover over the compartments when my daughter had my phone. Then I didn't have to worry about her taking pictures with them on.<br /><br />To utilize the main feature of this case, however, you have to slide another lever at the bottom half which holds the battery. The logo of the company indicates the battery life, and by sliding the switch you charge your phone. There's a recessed button to the left of the logo which indicates how much battery life is left in the case itself.<br /><br />However, after a small incident the case was rendered useless.<br />I knew the materials used for the switches felt a bit cheap when I used them but I didn't think much of them because they worked. But yesterday I accidentally dropped the phone from my pocket as I grabbed it; I was in my bathroom so it fell on a soft floor. I'm not a very tall person, so I'd say the drop distance was about 2-3 feet max. When I picked up my phone I found a crack on my phone's screen. Initially I was panicked but then realized that it was of the glass screen protector, which easily can be replaced.<br />Later in the day, after putting my phone on silent, I heard the phone go off during a conversation. I thought it odd and switched it off again. That's when I realized that the switch to put the phone on silent had broken. I had to force it to turn the phone on and off silent.<br /><br />Then, when I was back home and wanted to charge the battery using the case, I realized that the battery slider had broken. Earlier I indicated that, in order to charge the phone by the case, you had to switch a slider at the bottom. Well, that slider slides no more. I tried forcing it to the charge side and it won't budge, not even a smidgen.<br /><br />I'm pretty bummed. Not only did the case not protect my phone from a small fall, but the case itself broke in several places. There was also a small crack in the case near the top. All of that from a short fall onto my bathroom floor.<br /><br />The only major gripe I had before this incident was that the case often came apart. It attaches onto the phone in two pieces, and because I wear somewhat fitted jeans the case usually came apart in my hand when taking out the phone from my pocket. It wasn't a deal-breaker more than it was an inconvenience, but now after yesterday I have many gripes about the phone.<br /><br />I miss my Belkin case from my old phone. Sure, it wasn't the best case I've ever used but at least it prevented my phone from damage from the three small drops I've caused it in two years, all the while keeping a charge over 70%. And it was $40 cheaper than this model, and that's considering I first received the Belkin case two years ago.<br /><br />I'll update this review as time goes on.<br /><br />***UPDATE 7/21/15***<br />I had contacted the company immediately after this review, and they responded the next day. They indicated that they had worked on an update to the case and will send me a replacement. That was over a week ago and I haven't heard back, let alone received the replacement. I contacted them again yesterday to follow up. I will keep this review updated.",1436662080000,4,False
5.0,"Finally, a stand of my own.","I've coveted camera stands since YouTubers started using them for product reviews. They're so steady and provide great shots for small little things, as well as pose worthy tools for still photo shots. Well, now I have one.<br /><br />Seeing as this clamps onto pretty much any phone, the universal stand accommodates both my iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 very snugly. I imagine the same would apply for Droids and other devices.<br />The set comes with a stand for cameras, though I don't own any right now so I can't vouch for that.<br /><br />The legs are extremely sturdy and haven't loosened on me so far. They are someone tense to manipulate, but I'd prefer that over having them flop on their own. They do open and close with little stress.<br /><br />The ball holding the clamp for the devices is pretty sturdy as well and locks well into place.<br />So far I'm very pleased with it.

It is thin and lightweight which I prefer compared to the chunky cases. I've noticed with this case, compared to my previous cases, that it amplifies the sound.  When I have phone calls on speaker, I can hear them more clearly and I don't have to repeat myself as often.

4.0,Car Mount,"I use this car mount everyday.  It is extremely helpful when wanting to use the GPS system on my iPhone.  It is easy to install and I love the fact that you can position your phone vertically or horizontally.  I was shocked that this mount used the CD slot in order to work, but it does indeed work!  It is slightly inconvenient though when you are trying to change the stations on the radio because the mount and phone block your view of the buttons.  This can become very irritating when driving.  Even with this inconvenience, however, I would recommend this car mount.  It is sturdy, easy to use, and fits my phone nicely.  I continue to use it everyday.  The convenience of having my phone accessible and in view for GPS navigation outweighs the inconvenience of not being able to see the radio stations.",1388431636000,0,False
5.0,Great basic case.,"I've been testing this case out for a week and I can say with brutal honesty that Amazon makes some strong competitors with their AmazonBasics line.<br />If you're looking for a ""basic"" case for your iPhone 4 that offers just general protection, this is it.  It's not exactly drop-proof as it is, after all, a thin, soft silicon layer, but it gets the job done.  I have a very similar case ([[ASIN:B003QP423M Amzer Luxe Argyle High Gloss TPU Soft Gel Skin Case for iPhone 4 (Smoke Grey) (Fits AT&T iPhone)]]) that was $3 more when I purchased it, and the AmazonBasics is just as good with the exception of covering the buttons and the Apple logo on back.  I was a bit worried that since it doesn't cover ANY of the buttons it would become a problem, but so far so good.  Only time will tell.<br /><br />The case does have some sharper edges than the Amzer's rounded ones, but it hasn't become a problem yet.  In fact, it actually adds some grip when I play Angry Birds!  I let my father use my phone once and he complained that the case hurt his ear, but I haven't experienced any problems yet myself.<br /><br />AmazonBasics is just that: basic accessories made and sent from Amazon.  If you want a generic case that will save your phone from a small drop, look no further.  If you expect to drop your iPhone from a three-story building without any issues however, then you need a different case.  Or a slap in the face.  Either or.",1307561302000,0,False

3.0,A No No for a Google Voice User,"I really wanted to love the phone. Being a purist, and my last two phones being a Nexus, the very heavy Zen UI skin was a little to get used to. Also, the physical capacititve buttons should have been omitted for onscreen buttons. The phone is powerful, and if getting the 64GB model with a 64GB card, you can have 128GB of storage which competes with Samsung and Apple phones for half the price. I am returning the phone the next business day after buying it. The reason of why is for some reason (likely the Asus Phone dialer at fault), the phone will ignore Google Voice. If you use Google Voice, you know that it will dial another number so your GV number can display. This will not work with the ZenFone 2. This is also not just the phone, nor any setting as this seems to be a regular problem with other ZenFone 2 users. Since only my GV number is provided, this phone would not work for me. And yes, there are people that will say use Hangouts dialer, but on cellular, this consumes data, and you don't want hangouts ringing at the same time your phone is ringing.<br /><br />If you rely on Google Voice to make phone calls, simply put, do NOT get this phone.

With my previous iPhone 3GS with an OtterBox Commuter case, I could just dock it on the radio.  Once docked, I could then charge my iPhone and also play songs/books from the iPhone through the radio speakers.  Also, the radio controls would operate my iPhone.  Apparently with my new iPhone 4S/case combination, caused it not to dock snuggly and not work with my iPhone docking radios.  I purchased the dock extender cable in anticipation that all would work as it did previously.  The cable appears to make a good connection and the iPhone make a sound when I plug it into the cable.  Unfortunately, the iPhone will no longer play through the radio nor will any of the radio controls work with the iPhone.  I guess I will have to look at getting a different type of docking radio.  Also, I tried a different dock extender cable from another Amazon vendor and it also did not work.

5.0,My family goes thru a lot of screen protectors..,My family has an array of phones like any other family and even though the phones claim the screens are durable themselves it's always better to add a little protection.

5.0,UPDATED on rock climbing!!!!!! PERFECT FIT for series 4 Apple Watch!!,Can I get a subscription or bigger pack of these? I love them. And yeah I’m gonna break them. But for the price of these and price of my Apple Watch it’s worth it. I use my watch to track climbs so taking off my watch isn’t an option. Have broken 6 in 5 months. All from climbing or hitting them on the metal doors at work(still keep on the screen till it’s shattered to hell because they have great glue.) my watch is scratch free.<br />Update: The screens really look nice. I can’t even tell there is a glass screen protector. I have had ZERO problems with the touch interface. THOUGH as a rock climber I still break these... usually on top rope or lead climbing. Have not broke one bouldering (knock on wood). I have broken three so far in about a months time. They are way more durable than any other screens I’ve used. And can take a beating of everyday activities. They do not hold up to impact on rock. I still need to be careful when climbing but that’s understandable.<br />Once broken they still really really stick to the screen. So I can keep going until I shatter the heck out of it.<br />Again I HIGHLY recommend!<br /><br />Original Post: Best screen so far. It fits tight on the screen and perfect fit around the bevel on the watch. The touch screen works just the same as without it. I’ve tried multiple screens and unfortunately not many companies make a good glass screen for the series 4 yet since it’s still new. This one is by far the best. Havnt went climbing in it yet. But there is no lip around the edge so I feel it’ll be more durable.<br /><br />Installing is difficult if you don’t have patience. You do need to repeditly lift one edge and push the bubbles out. But that’s because of the 3D Touch and bevel on the screen. But trust me you can eventually get them out and they will stay out.<br /><br />Highly recommend.,1549486779560,0,True

You can't beat it. And that pin removal adjustment tool is the best bonus/free/included item I might have every received. I have a very elaborate watch kit for case/battery/band adjustments. And the pin tool included in this kit was silver lining to setting up this watch band set. I would recommend all users of the tool to rub a candle on the threads to ease use of the tool.<br /><br />If you have the Pixel Watch, hate silicone bands and like the metal band style.

I have not seen any way to rotate screen while the watch charges on its side. Also should mention I use a men's stainless metal watch band and it does not affect the charger. The basic Pixel silicone bands are no issue either. This charger block stays put on all flat surfaces.<br />I may still 3D print something a bit fancier.

It's also a great way to see incoming notifications and calls while she watches TV. While she has many other colors. She uses and raves about this purple one and had me buy more to give to the nurses who help her with daily needs.<br /><br />Long story short.

I saw many reviews with these broken at either end. Mine is wrapped around my couch arm. I tried to make the bends a couple inches away from the ends to keep the clamp end and phone ends straight as to not stress them too much. This model is far superior to the other 3 I paid about the same price for. It is longer, and much stiffer.<br />Many other options and there might be better versions. And time will tell if mine breaks like others have had happen. For now, it's a decent purchase. Kind of wish for the price it included the car style clamp as well.  The hair clip looking clamp is a bit bulky for my setup.",1658461247109,5,True

I tried these and liked that the ring moves 360° because you have a lot more control that way. I have an iPhone 8+ and it worked well. I’m giving this 3 stars because after 2-3 weeks, the ring became really loose and somewhat defeated the purpose. Another issue was that the bat symbol is actually really sharp around the edges in some spots because it’s made of metal. It’s not a big deal, just a little annoying. Finally, with the ring, your phone will never lay flat by any means because the connector for the ring is tiny and slightly taller than the rest of the gadget. With a pop socket, your phone has 1.5 inches of flat surface area to rest on so you don’t have this issue, so if your phone is on a table or something it’s really annoying to text or even switch songs because the phone will just wobble so much. But it is cool that it comes with tiny command type hooks and you can hang your phone up!",1522980011244,0,True

Material seems like nice. While they are not the expensive real leather, they feel soft/smooth. Magnet holder works well, both ways. After i put my phone and 4 cards the case gets a little fat but it still closes well.

5.0,An Exceptional Eye Cream (w/a strong rose scent),"I get a bit when a product says it will brighten skin. Years ago, my sister used a skin brightening cream under her eyes that made her look like a raccoon. lololol.  Thankfully, that doesn't happen with Alteya's Organic Eye Cream. I like the consistency of the cream; at first I thought it appeared to be a bit on the thicker side but that's not the case. Its nice and lightweight, VERY easy to apply (a little truly does go a LONG way!) and absorption is fast.  No greasy/oily look or feel is left behind.  Adds much needed moisture to the skin under and around my eyes, replaces dark circles /puffiness with some brightening while reducing fine lines and wrinkles.  It feels nice while being applied, as it absorbs and after absorption is completed. I have dry, sensitive skin and have no issues with the cream.<br /><br />There is a rose scent that I find to be very strong.  I'm not a fan of most things rose scented and that includes this cream. But it doesn't take very long before the scent is undetectable to me.<br /><br />I never heard of the Alteya brand before but now, I'm a huge fan of this eye cream.  I love the results it delivers and does so quickly.  The jar contains  0.51oz. I know that doesn't sound like much but I stress that VERY little cream is needed to adequately cover the area around the eyes. I use this twice a day , this jar will still last me a LONG time.  I find the price reasonable. I'm not deducting stars from my overall rating with regards to the strong rose scent since its no longer detectable to me after a short amount of time.",1639173924150,1,False

4.0,Finally! A mount that works with F-150 air vents!,"Vehicle installed in: 2014 Ford F-150<br /><br />I have been on the hunt for a solid, wireless phone charger for my husband for years. While there are a ton of options on the market, I always run into one major problem... my husband drives a Ford F-150 with the round air vents and I've learned through out the years of hunting that hardly any of the available mounts will work with this type of vent. Frustrating doesn't even begin to describe it.<br /><br />Then I found this beauty from Andobil! I am *extremely* pleased to share that this mount does indeed mount securely to the round type air vents found in Ford F-150 trucks and remains attached and stable even when driving on dirt roads and two tracks! In fact, I was so happy with this purchase that I literally did the Walter Houston dance! Ha! Since I only installed it a few days ago, I cannot speak to the durability of it yet but it seems as if it is well built and should hold up for quite some time for us.

5.0,Best car charger ever,"Vehicle: 2012 Ram 1500 Laramie Crew Cab<br /><br />This is, by far, the hands down best car charger I have ever owned.

A lot of my driving includes ""turn off the paved road"" which results in quite a few bumpy stretches and this charger holds on so tight there is barely any noticeable movement. Due to the depth and shape of my dash, I can't use the included dash mount plate so I will not be including that install method in my review. I can say, however, that the air vent clip is magnificent! It latches on and doesn't move. The wireless charging works flawlessly. And the auto open and close feature is a dream! The only downside I've found with this setup is that the auto open and close feature will refuse to operate if the ambient temperature is below 40f. At those times, I just put my phone in the center console and after a few minutes of running the heater the charger has warmed up enough that the auto open and close feature will operate again.",1613381861918,0,True

5.0,Fabulous Case for Droid Turbo Ballistic Nylon,"The PureGear fits my Turbo BN perfectly. I am quite pleased with all aspects of this case. The precision cuts for the camera/flash/sensor/speakers on the rear of the case are perfect. As are the cutouts for the headphones jack and charging port. The aesthetics of my BN finish are not covered which is one of the main reasons I wanted to give this case a try. The PureGear puts my BN backing on display nicely. (Now if I could just figure out how to remove the Verizon logo from the BN back.. it appears to be similar to an iron-on patch or whatnot. I've noticed some Turbo BN phones do not even have the VZW logo. Would be wonderful if someone has removed this and take a few moments to explain the process to me!)<br /><br />From my experience with cases for past phones, this is extremely thin and lightweight. It doesn't appear to add much bulk, if any. With eyes closed, I wouldn't even realize a case was on my Turbo except for the grippy plastic feeling. A major bonus for me as the Turbo is pushing the limits of my female hands when it's naked, let alone in a case.<br /><br />As for slipperiness, which I know is an issue most have with the clear cases... check out the picture below. I tried to take a picture of the back of my hand to emphasize the angle the phone is at, but I about dropped my phone, lol. Suffice it to say, in this picture, the phone in the PureGear case is resting on my palm.. no fingers are gripping it nor is a corner resting on my palm.. absolutely no support is provided to the phone/case combo. My hand is at about a 85 degree angle and the case is not slipping. Needless to say, I am pleased with the no-slip-grip it seems to have. Granted, if you put this on a slick surface, like a book, binder or arm of the couch.. then yes, it will glide right off. To me however, it is the grip in hand that counts and so far it's got it where it counts. lol<br /><br />Only issues I have noticed..<br /><br />It is rather difficult to remove once it's on the phone. This may ease over time and use. However, on the other hand, it is also a comfort knowing that it is on my phone snug and won't slip off on a corner like some other cases for the Turbo BN are known to do.<br /><br />Also, the power button responds without much extra effort but the volume buttons/rocker is another story. I have to press harder than I believe I should to get any reaction from them. Hopefully, like with the difficulty of removing the case, the stiffness in the buttons will relax over time as well.<br /><br />Neither of these issues are deal breakers for me. I still love the case and the appearance of my phone in it. Overall, I would deduct only 1/2 a star, if I could, for these. As it is, I'll rate it as a 5 here as I don't see these issues as being bad enough to merit a full star reduction.<br /><br />Since I am a case fanatic, I will certainly be ordering a few others so I can swap them out depending on my mood (actually eyeballing the clear/black option from PureGear right now). But the PureGear clear/clear will remain in my arsenal and for now will serve as permanent case. Personally, I give it 4.5 stars (reduced due to the slight difficulty of removing it).",1423525352000,5,True
5.0,Finally a holder that works,"Installed in my 2012 Dodge Ram 1500<br /><br />Ever since I got my new Droid Razr Maxx, I have been searching for a holder for it to use in my truck on longer drives. This item fills the bill perfectly. The base can be twisted to expand and contract making it easy to fit just about any cup holder. My phone fits between the arms fine, even in its case which is nice not having to remove that. And the arms, and back panel, are padded so if you happen to not have a case on your phone, then it should not scratch it much, if at all. The upper part rotates allowing you to view your phone in profile or landscape mode. The gooseneck is tight and difficult to position - I admit that I thought I was going to break it at first. But once you give it a little more elbow grease, it will budge and allow you to aim it at the angle that works for you. I especially like the arm release button which makes removing my phone from the arms quick and easy. With my phone installed and the holder installed in one of my center console cup holders, this holder does not bounce, shimmy, shake or move whatsoever while my truck is in motion. A major plus! All in all, a great purchase that I recommend.",1391066242000,0,True
4.0,"The best tips, but very short","After receiving my first Kindle (and first tablet) for Christmas, I had to do research on what the best stylus' were. I learned there are different tips available and how they differed from one another. I quickly leaned toward the micro-fiber tip as I like the reports and claims of not requiring as much force to be recognized on the screen. I purchased this set as I couldn't decided which color to get and am pleased with my purchase. The colors are vibrant and the tips glide effortlessly and beautifully across my Kindle's screen.<br /><br />My only complaints about this set are:<br />#1 The clips are not very tight making it very easy for the pen to slip off of whatever you 'clip' it to.<br />#2 The length is a bit short and I have found small blisters forming on my hand as the pen is shorter than normal pens which causes me to hold it unusually.<br /><br />For now, these pens are fulfilling my needs, however I am on the hunt for a similar micro fiber tipped stylus that is a bit longer.<br /><br />***UPDATE 2/4/2014***<br />The seller sent me a complimentary set of these stylus' [[ASIN:B00D9JH7MI The Friendly Swede (TM) Bundle of 2 Micro-Knit Hybrid Fiber Tip Capacitive Stylus Pens 5.2"" + 4 x 15'' Rubberized Steel and Elastic Tether Lanyards + Cleaning Cloth (Zebra Hot Pink + Purple)]] after they read my review above.<br /><br />The customer service is beyond superb with this seller. So rest assured that if you make a purchase from them and you are not satisfied, they will work with you to fix the situation or issue. And very quickly, I might add!<br /><br />This new set has answered my aforementioned issues with the clip and length. The clips on the new set are much more superior in both design and weight and they actually stay clipped on whatever you clip them to. They are also longer and I have learned that my hands require the longer length when it comes to stylus'. The weight of the new set is also more substantial. It feels like I am nearly holding a regular ink pen and not grasping onto air.

I also cannot attest to this product's ability to protect a phone from a drop as I did not feel confident that it would stay on the phone upon any kind of impact. So I chose not to submit my $600 phone to what I deemed an imminent death. This case will be returned.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Next, the Trident Aegis:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Sturdy, two part design.<br />-Everything lined up beautifully on my Razr Maxx.<br />-Install was a breeze, with only a little encouraging to get the inner silicone liner to set inside the lip of the outer hard shell casing.<br />-The outer hard shell has two built-in mesh-like dust covers that go over the rear speaker and the noise-cancelling speaker when installed on the phone.<br />-The design on the back of the inside silicone liner pokes through the back of the outer hard shell and slightly raises the phone off any surface it is laying on, thus making the speaker sound un-muffled. This is a difficult feature to find in cases these days (why manufacturers don't just place the speaker on the front of the phone for this very reason, is beyond me).<br />-All ports are covered by silicone flaps.<br />-Accessibility to the MicroSD and Sim cards without case removal.<br />-Power and volume buttons are covered and operate as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-When laying face down, the outer rim of the case provides protection to the touch screen by slightly raising it off of any surface it is placed on.<br />-Adds bulk, but not as much as the Otterbox Commuter case.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-There are two locations (along the edge of the MicroSD and Sim card protection flap and along the front, top, center of the phone - directly above 'Motorola') on the silicone liner where the silicone is in extremely thin strips. I do not see these holding up very long as I can see these ripping or tearing after sufficient use.<br />-The protective flaps are flimsy and do not set into place very well (with the exception of the headphone jack cover, which seats almost too well).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />Even though I have listed more pros than cons, I will not be keeping this case. To me, a cell phone case should be something that you can easily install (and remove if necessary) and not be something that you have to continuously battle to stay in place on your phone. Although it is not a deal breaker for me if a phone has protective flaps over access ports or not - it does matter to me that if a case does have these that they set in place properly and not flap around freely. I also am fearful of the longevity of this case given the thinness of the inner silicone liner. For these reasons, I believe I will be returning this Trident Aegis case.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Next, the Seidio Surface (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Lined up well with the camera, flash, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and all buttons.<br />-Does not add any noticeable bulk.<br />-Exterior surface is has a soft-to-the-touch feeling while remaining hard.<br />-Includes a holster.<br />-MicroSD/Sim card access door area of the case is solid. (This may be a con to others, but I prefer this be solid as I rarely ever need to access my SD or Sim cards.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-No silicone components making it very slick.<br />-Easy to put on the phone, but be prepared for an all out battle to remove it. I spent close to fifteen minutes fighting this thing, trying to coerce it off of my phone. Due to its lack of any silicone, I could not get a good grip on the case and had to turn my phone off as I kept pressing the power and volume buttons in my all out brawl.<br />-All ports are exposed (except the MicroSD and Sim card access door, see Pros list above).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />This case is laughable. It is the only case in my many years of cell phone ownership to cause me so much frustration upon trying to remove it from my phone. The scenario I found myself in while trying to remove the case was very similar to trying to get out of a Chinese finger trap - pretty much every movement makes things worse. I prefer a case to fit snugly, as those offer the best protection because they will not slip or slide on the phone. But this Seidio Surface case, wow.. needless to say, despite the pros I listed for it, this case will be returned.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />And, finally, the Seidio Active (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Does not add much bulk (as compared to the Otterbox Commuter)<br />-Well thought out and functional two part design<br />-Feels good in the hand<br />-Easy to operate while holding in one hand (not too heavy)<br />-Silicone along the edges makes is very easy to grip and keep your grip. This case will rarely slip from your grasp.<br />-All ports and the camera, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and buttons line up perfectly.<br />-Power and volume buttons respond with the same (if not better!) sensitivity as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-The MicroSD and Sim card access door is completely blocked (again, I know some others may prefer to have access to this door, but this is a preference of mine as I hardly ever need to remove/replace these cards).<br />-The kickstand is a fun addition - is functional and seems as though it would last quite awhile as long as you were gentle when pulling it from its seated magnetic position.<br />-Includes a belt holster which fits the phone w/case perfectly.<br />-The phone w/case can be seated in the included holster either facing in or out.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The addition of the kickstand on the back causes the phone to tilt toward the top - this muffles the rear speaker.<br />-With so much silicone exposed on the sides of the phone, I can see the potential for these areas being dust magnets.<br />-The top ports (HDMI, Power and headphone jack) are left openly exposed. Although this is not a deal breaker for me, it may be for others. (NOTE: Because the phone can be inserted into the holster either faced in or out, the holster's clip partially covers the top ports, offering some protection. Not much, but thought I would mention it.)<br />-The retention clip on the holster appears to have a disadvantage because of its design - due to the curve and the distance the clip extends from the phone, I can see this potentially catching on things (seat belts, couches, chairs, etc.) and either breaking the clip entirely, rendering the holster useless and requiring a replacement be purchased OR dislodging the phone from the holster allowing it to fall to the ground.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I believe I finally found the case I have been searching for - the Seidio Active. My husband also chose this case of the four we received and I have reviewed here. So, he got to keep the black version (we returned the other three reviewed above) and I purchased and received this purple version for my phone (I prefer a color that stands out more than the over-popular black).<br /><br />The purple color of my case is extremely close to what is depicted here on Amazon. It does appear slightly lighter though and seems to have a more metallic appearance than pictured here. But this could easily be attributed to resolution differences which varies from computer to computer. If this is a color that you are interested in purchasing, just know that there is very little difference between the online picture and the actual case in hand. It took me holding my phone next to the picture here to notice any difference.<br /><br />Thank you for reading.

The cases purchased and compared were:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00829HLZS Asmyna MOTXT912MHPCSO006NP Premium Durable Protective Case for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX XT912 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0077IQA2K Trident Case AG-XT912-BK AEGIS Case for Motorola Droid Razr MAXX (XT912) - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007KZQNP4 Seidio BD2-HR3MTRM-BK SURFACE Case and Holster Combo for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007PPYXME Seidio BD2-HK3MTRMK-BK ACTIVE Combo with Metal Kickstand for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />First, the Asmyna:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-It is easy to 'install'.<br />-The front and back pieces audibly snap together and seems to hold firm.<br />-It feels good in the hand, being somewhat slick and glossy.<br />-Does not add bulk to an already sizable phone.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-It does not line up properly with the camera, flash, speaker or noise-cancelling speaker on the back of the phone.<br />-It is too slick, causing it to slide off of just about any surface.<br />-It is extremely prone to fingerprints.<br />-All ports are openly exposed to the elements (dust and particle collection, moisture, etc.)<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I would not recommend this case as, for me, its cons outweigh its pros. I also cannot attest to this product's ability to protect a phone from a drop as I did not feel confident that it would stay on the phone upon any kind of impact. So I chose not to submit my $600 phone to what I deemed an imminent death. This case will be returned.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Next, the Trident Aegis:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Sturdy, two part design.<br />-Everything lined up beautifully on my Razr Maxx.<br />-Install was a breeze, with only a little encouraging to get the inner silicone liner to set inside the lip of the outer hard shell casing.<br />-The outer hard shell has two built-in mesh-like dust covers that go over the rear speaker and the noise-cancelling speaker when installed on the phone.<br />-The design on the back of the inside silicone liner pokes through the back of the outer hard shell and slightly raises the phone off any surface it is laying on, thus making the speaker sound un-muffled. This is a difficult feature to find in cases these days (why manufacturers don't just place the speaker on the front of the phone for this very reason, is beyond me).<br />-All ports are covered by silicone flaps.<br />-Accessibility to the MicroSD and Sim cards without case removal.<br />-Power and volume buttons are covered and operate as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-When laying face down, the outer rim of the case provides protection to the touch screen by slightly raising it off of any surface it is placed on.<br />-Adds bulk, but not as much as the Otterbox Commuter case.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-There are two locations (along the edge of the MicroSD and Sim card protection flap and along the front, top, center of the phone - directly above 'Motorola') on the silicone liner where the silicone is in extremely thin strips. I do not see these holding up very long as I can see these ripping or tearing after sufficient use.<br />-The protective flaps are flimsy and do not set into place very well (with the exception of the headphone jack cover, which seats almost too well).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />Even though I have listed more pros than cons, I will not be keeping this case. To me, a cell phone case should be something that you can easily install (and remove if necessary) and not be something that you have to continuously battle to stay in place on your phone. Although it is not a deal breaker for me if a phone has protective flaps over access ports or not - it does matter to me that if a case does have these that they set in place properly and not flap around freely. I also am fearful of the longevity of this case given the thinness of the inner silicone liner. For these reasons, I believe I will be returning this Trident Aegis case.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Next, the Seidio Surface (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Lined up well with the camera, flash, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and all buttons.<br />-Does not add any noticeable bulk.<br />-Exterior surface is has a soft-to-the-touch feeling while remaining hard.<br />-Includes a holster.<br />-MicroSD/Sim card access door area of the case is solid. (This may be a con to others, but I prefer this be solid as I rarely ever need to access my SD or Sim cards.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-No silicone components making it very slick.<br />-Easy to put on the phone, but be prepared for an all out battle to remove it. I spent close to fifteen minutes fighting this thing, trying to coerce it off of my phone. Due to its lack of any silicone, I could not get a good grip on the case and had to turn my phone off as I kept pressing the power and volume buttons in my all out brawl.<br />-All ports are exposed (except the MicroSD and Sim card access door, see Pros list above).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />This case is laughable. It is the only case in my many years of cell phone ownership to cause me so much frustration upon trying to remove it from my phone. The scenario I found myself in while trying to remove the case was very similar to trying to get out of a Chinese finger trap - pretty much every movement makes things worse. I prefer a case to fit snugly, as those offer the best protection because they will not slip or slide on the phone. But this Seidio Surface case, wow.. needless to say, despite the pros I listed for it, this case will be returned.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />And, finally, the Seidio Active (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Does not add much bulk (as compared to the Otterbox Commuter)<br />-Well thought out and functional two part design<br />-Feels good in the hand<br />-Easy to operate while holding in one hand (not too heavy)<br />-Silicone along the edges makes is very easy to grip and keep your grip. This case will rarely slip from your grasp.<br />-All ports and the camera, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and buttons line up perfectly.<br />-Power and volume buttons respond with the same (if not better!) sensitivity as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-The MicroSD and Sim card access door is completely blocked (again, I know some others may prefer to have access to this door, but this is a preference of mine as I hardly ever need to remove/replace these cards).<br />-The kickstand is a fun addition - is functional and seems as though it would last quite awhile as long as you were gentle when pulling it from its seated magnetic position.<br />-Includes a belt holster which fits the phone w/case perfectly.<br />-The phone w/case can be seated in the included holster either facing in or out.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The addition of the kickstand on the back causes the phone to tilt toward the top - this muffles the rear speaker.<br />-With so much silicone exposed on the sides of the phone, I can see the potential for these areas being dust magnets.<br />-The top ports (HDMI, Power and headphone jack) are left openly exposed. Although this is not a deal breaker for me, it may be for others. (NOTE: Because the phone can be inserted into the holster either faced in or out, the holster's clip partially covers the top ports, offering some protection. Not much, but thought I would mention it.)<br />-The retention clip on the holster appears to have a disadvantage because of its design - due to the curve and the distance the clip extends from the phone, I can see this potentially catching on things (seat belts, couches, chairs, etc.) and either breaking the clip entirely, rendering the holster useless and requiring a replacement be purchased OR dislodging the phone from the holster allowing it to fall to the ground.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I believe I finally found the case I have been searching for - the Seidio Active. My husband also chose this case of the four we received and I have reviewed here. So, I guess that means I need to purchase another one for myself. The black is exactly what my husband wanted, but I prefer a color that stands out more.. so I suppose I will be buying the red or blue. Once I receive that case, I will update my review to report on the clarity of the color as opposed to the color depicted here online.<br /><br />Thank you for reading. I hope my search helps someone else find the perfect case for them too (as well as saving them the time of conducting the research!).",1373676711000,1,False

This is a difficult feature to find in cases these days (why manufacturers don't just place the speaker on the front of the phone for this very reason, is beyond me).<br />-All ports are covered by silicone flaps.<br />-Accessibility to the MicroSD and Sim cards without case removal.<br />-Power and volume buttons are covered and operate as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-When laying face down, the outer rim of the case provides protection to the touch screen by slightly raising it off of any surface it is placed on.<br />-Adds bulk, but not as much as the Otterbox Commuter case.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-There are two locations (along the edge of the MicroSD and Sim card protection flap and along the front, top, center of the phone - directly above 'Motorola') on the silicone liner where the silicone is in extremely thin strips. I do not see these holding up very long as I can see these ripping or tearing after sufficient use.<br />-The protective flaps are flimsy and do not set into place very well (with the exception of the headphone jack cover, which seats almost too well).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />Even though I have listed more pros than cons, I will not be keeping this case. To me, a cell phone case should be something that you can easily install (and remove if necessary) and not be something that you have to continuously battle to stay in place on your phone. Although it is not a deal breaker for me if a phone has protective flaps over access ports or not - it does matter to me that if a case does have these that they set in place properly and not flap around freely. I also am fearful of the longevity of this case given the thinness of the inner silicone liner. For these reasons, I believe I will be returning this Trident Aegis case.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Next, the Seidio Surface (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Lined up well with the camera, flash, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and all buttons.<br />-Does not add any noticeable bulk.<br />-Exterior surface is has a soft-to-the-touch feeling while remaining hard.<br />-Includes a holster.<br />-MicroSD/Sim card access door area of the case is solid. (This may be a con to others, but I prefer this be solid as I rarely ever need to access my SD or Sim cards.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-No silicone components making it very slick.<br />-Easy to put on the phone, but be prepared for an all out battle to remove it. I spent close to fifteen minutes fighting this thing, trying to coerce it off of my phone. Due to its lack of any silicone, I could not get a good grip on the case and had to turn my phone off as I kept pressing the power and volume buttons in my all out brawl.<br />-All ports are exposed (except the MicroSD and Sim card access door, see Pros list above).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />This case is laughable. It is the only case in my many years of cell phone ownership to cause me so much frustration upon trying to remove it from my phone. The scenario I found myself in while trying to remove the case was very similar to trying to get out of a Chinese finger trap - pretty much every movement makes things worse. I prefer a case to fit snugly, as those offer the best protection because they will not slip or slide on the phone. But this Seidio Surface case, wow.. needless to say, despite the pros I listed for it, this case will be returned.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />And, finally, the Seidio Active (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Does not add much bulk (as compared to the Otterbox Commuter)<br />-Well thought out and functional two part design<br />-Feels good in the hand<br />-Easy to operate while holding in one hand (not too heavy)<br />-Silicone along the edges makes is very easy to grip and keep your grip. This case will rarely slip from your grasp.<br />-All ports and the camera, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and buttons line up perfectly.<br />-Power and volume buttons respond with the same (if not better!) sensitivity as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-The MicroSD and Sim card access door is completely blocked (again, I know some others may prefer to have access to this door, but this is a preference of mine as I hardly ever need to remove/replace these cards).<br />-The kickstand is a fun addition - is functional and seems as though it would last quite awhile as long as you were gentle when pulling it from its seated magnetic position.<br />-Includes a belt holster which fits the phone w/case perfectly.<br />-The phone w/case can be seated in the included holster either facing in or out.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The addition of the kickstand on the back causes the phone to tilt toward the top - this muffles the rear speaker.<br />-With so much silicone exposed on the sides of the phone, I can see the potential for these areas being dust magnets.<br />-The top ports (HDMI, Power and headphone jack) are left openly exposed. Although this is not a deal breaker for me, it may be for others. (NOTE: Because the phone can be inserted into the holster either faced in or out, the holster's clip partially covers the top ports, offering some protection. Not much, but thought I would mention it.)<br />-The retention clip on the holster appears to have a disadvantage because of its design - due to the curve and the distance the clip extends from the phone, I can see this potentially catching on things (seat belts, couches, chairs, etc.) and either breaking the clip entirely, rendering the holster useless and requiring a replacement be purchased OR dislodging the phone from the holster allowing it to fall to the ground.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I believe I finally found the case I have been searching for - the Seidio Active. My husband also chose this case of the four we received and I have reviewed here. So, I guess that means I need to purchase another one for myself. The black is exactly what my husband wanted, but I prefer a color that stands out more.. so I suppose I will be buying the red or blue. Once I receive that case, I will update my review to report on the clarity of the color as opposed to the color depicted here online.<br /><br />Thank you for reading. I hope my search helps someone else find the perfect case for them too (as well as saving them the time of conducting the research!).",1373676257000,1,False

The silicone flaps covering the access ports on the Otterbox Razr Maxx cases were nothing short of a disappointment. They never seated correctly and were always coming loose and flapping around allowing dust and particles into the ports. One of the reasons for purchasing the Otterbox cases was because it had these port covers. Since those failed to perform correctly these cases were removed from our phones and they have been naked and without protection for about a week now.<br /><br />After extensive research of countless cases and reviews here on Amazon, I purchased this case along with three others in a desperate attempt to find the right case for our Droid Razr Maxx phones, once and for all.

I spent close to fifteen minutes fighting this thing, trying to coerce it off of my phone. Due to its lack of any silicone, I could not get a good grip on the case and had to turn my phone off as I kept pressing the power and volume buttons in my all out brawl.<br />-All ports are exposed (except the MicroSD and Sim card access door, see Pros list above).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />This case is laughable. It is the only case in my many years of cell phone ownership to cause me so much frustration upon trying to remove it from my phone. The scenario I found myself in while trying to remove the case was very similar to trying to get out of a Chinese finger trap - pretty much every movement makes things worse. I prefer a case to fit snugly, as those offer the best protection because they will not slip or slide on the phone.

This case will rarely slip from your grasp.<br />-All ports and the camera, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and buttons line up perfectly.<br />-Power and volume buttons respond with the same (if not better!) sensitivity as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-The MicroSD and Sim card access door is completely blocked (again, I know some others may prefer to have access to this door, but this is a preference of mine as I hardly ever need to remove/replace these cards).<br />-The kickstand is a fun addition - is functional and seems as though it would last quite awhile as long as you were gentle when pulling it from its seated magnetic position.<br />-Includes a belt holster which fits the phone w/case perfectly.<br />-The phone w/case can be seated in the included holster either facing in or out.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The addition of the kickstand on the back causes the phone to tilt toward the top - this muffles the rear speaker.<br />-With so much silicone exposed on the sides of the phone, I can see the potential for these areas being dust magnets.<br />-The top ports (HDMI, Power and headphone jack) are left openly exposed. Although this is not a deal breaker for me, it may be for others. (NOTE: Because the phone can be inserted into the holster either faced in or out, the holster's clip partially covers the top ports, offering some protection. Not much, but thought I would mention it.)<br />-The retention clip on the holster appears to have a disadvantage because of its design - due to the curve and the distance the clip extends from the phone, I can see this potentially catching on things (seat belts, couches, chairs, etc.) and either breaking the clip entirely, rendering the holster useless and requiring a replacement be purchased OR dislodging the phone from the holster allowing it to fall to the ground.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I believe I finally found the case I have been searching for - the Seidio Active. My husband also chose this case of the four we received and I have reviewed here. So, I guess that means I need to purchase another one for myself.

5.0,Finally found my case!,"My husband and I both have a Droid Razr Maxx. His was purchased October 2, 2012 and mine was purchased March 21, 2013.<br /><br />We originally purchased two [[ASIN:B006WC0U4G Otterbox Commuter Case for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]] as I had an Otterbox on my previous phone (a Droid Incredible 2) and loved it. The silicone flaps covering the access ports on the Otterbox Razr Maxx cases were nothing short of a disappointment. They never seated correctly and were always coming loose and flapping around allowing dust and particles into the ports. One of the reasons for purchasing the Otterbox cases was because it had these port covers. Since those failed to perform correctly these cases were removed from our phones and they have been naked and without protection for about a week now.<br /><br />After extensive research of countless cases and reviews here on Amazon, I purchased this case along with three others in a desperate attempt to find the right case for our Droid Razr Maxx phones, once and for all. The cases purchased and compared were:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00829HLZS Asmyna MOTXT912MHPCSO006NP Premium Durable Protective Case for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX XT912 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0077IQA2K Trident Case AG-XT912-BK AEGIS Case for Motorola Droid Razr MAXX (XT912) - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007KZQNP4 Seidio BD2-HR3MTRM-BK SURFACE Case and Holster Combo for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007PPYXME Seidio BD2-HK3MTRMK-BK ACTIVE Combo with Metal Kickstand for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />First, the Asmyna:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-It is easy to 'install'.<br />-The front and back pieces audibly snap together and seems to hold firm.<br />-It feels good in the hand, being somewhat slick and glossy.<br />-Does not add bulk to an already sizable phone.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-It does not line up properly with the camera, flash, speaker or noise-cancelling speaker on the back of the phone.<br />-It is too slick, causing it to slide off of just about any surface.<br />-It is extremely prone to fingerprints.<br />-All ports are openly exposed to the elements (dust and particle collection, moisture, etc.)<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I would not recommend this case as, for me, its cons outweigh its pros. I also cannot attest to this product's ability to protect a phone from a drop as I did not feel confident that it would stay on the phone upon any kind of impact.

This case will be returned.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Next, the Trident Aegis:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Sturdy, two part design.<br />-Everything lined up beautifully on my Razr Maxx.<br />-Install was a breeze, with only a little encouraging to get the inner silicone liner to set inside the lip of the outer hard shell casing.<br />-The outer hard shell has two built-in mesh-like dust covers that go over the rear speaker and the noise-cancelling speaker when installed on the phone.<br />-The design on the back of the inside silicone liner pokes through the back of the outer hard shell and slightly raises the phone off any surface it is laying on, thus making the speaker sound un-muffled. This is a difficult feature to find in cases these days (why manufacturers don't just place the speaker on the front of the phone for this very reason, is beyond me).<br />-All ports are covered by silicone flaps.<br />-Accessibility to the MicroSD and Sim cards without case removal.<br />-Power and volume buttons are covered and operate as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-When laying face down, the outer rim of the case provides protection to the touch screen by slightly raising it off of any surface it is placed on.<br />-Adds bulk, but not as much as the Otterbox Commuter case.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-There are two locations (along the edge of the MicroSD and Sim card protection flap and along the front, top, center of the phone - directly above 'Motorola') on the silicone liner where the silicone is in extremely thin strips. I do not see these holding up very long as I can see these ripping or tearing after sufficient use.<br />-The protective flaps are flimsy and do not set into place very well (with the exception of the headphone jack cover, which seats almost too well).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />Even though I have listed more pros than cons, I will not be keeping this case. To me, a cell phone case should be something that you can easily install (and remove if necessary) and not be something that you have to continuously battle to stay in place on your phone. Although it is not a deal breaker for me if a phone has protective flaps over access ports or not - it does matter to me that if a case does have these that they set in place properly and not flap around freely.

3.0,"Nice, but not enough","My husband and I both have a Droid Razr Maxx. His was purchased October 2, 2012 and mine was purchased March 21, 2013.<br /><br />We originally purchased two [[ASIN:B006WC0U4G Otterbox Commuter Case for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]] as I had an Otterbox on my previous phone (a Droid Incredible 2) and loved it. The silicone flaps covering the access ports on the Otterbox Razr Maxx cases were nothing short of a disappointment. They never seated correctly and were always coming loose and flapping around allowing dust and particles into the ports. One of the reasons for purchasing the Otterbox cases was because it had these port covers. Since those failed to perform correctly these cases were removed from our phones and they have been naked and without protection for about a week now.<br /><br />After extensive research of countless cases and reviews here on Amazon, I purchased this case along with three others in a desperate attempt to find the right case for our Droid Razr Maxx phones, once and for all. The cases purchased and compared were:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00829HLZS Asmyna MOTXT912MHPCSO006NP Premium Durable Protective Case for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX XT912 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0077IQA2K Trident Case AG-XT912-BK AEGIS Case for Motorola Droid Razr MAXX (XT912) - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007KZQNP4 Seidio BD2-HR3MTRM-BK SURFACE Case and Holster Combo for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007PPYXME Seidio BD2-HK3MTRMK-BK ACTIVE Combo with Metal Kickstand for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />First, the Asmyna:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-It is easy to 'install'.<br />-The front and back pieces audibly snap together and seems to hold firm.<br />-It feels good in the hand, being somewhat slick and glossy.<br />-Does not add bulk to an already sizable phone.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-It does not line up properly with the camera, flash, speaker or noise-cancelling speaker on the back of the phone.<br />-It is too slick, causing it to slide off of just about any surface.<br />-It is extremely prone to fingerprints.<br />-All ports are openly exposed to the elements (dust and particle collection, moisture, etc.)<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I would not recommend this case as, for me, its cons outweigh its pros. I also cannot attest to this product's ability to protect a phone from a drop as I did not feel confident that it would stay on the phone upon any kind of impact. So I chose not to submit my $600 phone to what I deemed an imminent death. This case will be returned.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Next, the Trident Aegis:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Sturdy, two part design.<br />-Everything lined up beautifully on my Razr Maxx.<br />-Install was a breeze, with only a little encouraging to get the inner silicone liner to set inside the lip of the outer hard shell casing.<br />-The outer hard shell has two built-in mesh-like dust covers that go over the rear speaker and the noise-cancelling speaker when installed on the phone.<br />-The design on the back of the inside silicone liner pokes through the back of the outer hard shell and slightly raises the phone off any surface it is laying on, thus making the speaker sound un-muffled. This is a difficult feature to find in cases these days (why manufacturers don't just place the speaker on the front of the phone for this very reason, is beyond me).<br />-All ports are covered by silicone flaps.<br />-Accessibility to the MicroSD and Sim cards without case removal.<br />-Power and volume buttons are covered and operate as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-When laying face down, the outer rim of the case provides protection to the touch screen by slightly raising it off of any surface it is placed on.<br />-Adds bulk, but not as much as the Otterbox Commuter case.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-There are two locations (along the edge of the MicroSD and Sim card protection flap and along the front, top, center of the phone - directly above 'Motorola') on the silicone liner where the silicone is in extremely thin strips. I do not see these holding up very long as I can see these ripping or tearing after sufficient use.<br />-The protective flaps are flimsy and do not set into place very well (with the exception of the headphone jack cover, which seats almost too well).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />Even though I have listed more pros than cons, I will not be keeping this case. To me, a cell phone case should be something that you can easily install (and remove if necessary) and not be something that you have to continuously battle to stay in place on your phone. Although it is not a deal breaker for me if a phone has protective flaps over access ports or not - it does matter to me that if a case does have these that they set in place properly and not flap around freely. I also am fearful of the longevity of this case given the thinness of the inner silicone liner. For these reasons, I believe I will be returning this Trident Aegis case.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Next, the Seidio Surface (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Lined up well with the camera, flash, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and all buttons.<br />-Does not add any noticeable bulk.<br />-Exterior surface is has a soft-to-the-touch feeling while remaining hard.<br />-Includes a holster.<br />-MicroSD/Sim card access door area of the case is solid. (This may be a con to others, but I prefer this be solid as I rarely ever need to access my SD or Sim cards.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-No silicone components making it very slick.<br />-Easy to put on the phone, but be prepared for an all out battle to remove it. I spent close to fifteen minutes fighting this thing, trying to coerce it off of my phone. Due to its lack of any silicone, I could not get a good grip on the case and had to turn my phone off as I kept pressing the power and volume buttons in my all out brawl.<br />-All ports are exposed (except the MicroSD and Sim card access door, see Pros list above).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />This case is laughable. It is the only case in my many years of cell phone ownership to cause me so much frustration upon trying to remove it from my phone. The scenario I found myself in while trying to remove the case was very similar to trying to get out of a Chinese finger trap - pretty much every movement makes things worse. I prefer a case to fit snugly, as those offer the best protection because they will not slip or slide on the phone. But this Seidio Surface case, wow.. needless to say, despite the pros I listed for it, this case will be returned.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />And, finally, the Seidio Active (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Does not add much bulk (as compared to the Otterbox Commuter)<br />-Well thought out and functional two part design<br />-Feels good in the hand<br />-Easy to operate while holding in one hand (not too heavy)<br />-Silicone along the edges makes is very easy to grip and keep your grip. This case will rarely slip from your grasp.<br />-All ports and the camera, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and buttons line up perfectly.<br />-Power and volume buttons respond with the same (if not better!) sensitivity as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-The MicroSD and Sim card access door is completely blocked (again, I know some others may prefer to have access to this door, but this is a preference of mine as I hardly ever need to remove/replace these cards).<br />-The kickstand is a fun addition - is functional and seems as though it would last quite awhile as long as you were gentle when pulling it from its seated magnetic position.<br />-Includes a belt holster which fits the phone w/case perfectly.<br />-The phone w/case can be seated in the included holster either facing in or out.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The addition of the kickstand on the back causes the phone to tilt toward the top - this muffles the rear speaker.<br />-With so much silicone exposed on the sides of the phone, I can see the potential for these areas being dust magnets.<br />-The top ports (HDMI, Power and headphone jack) are left openly exposed. Although this is not a deal breaker for me, it may be for others. (NOTE: Because the phone can be inserted into the holster either faced in or out, the holster's clip partially covers the top ports, offering some protection. Not much, but thought I would mention it.)<br />-The retention clip on the holster appears to have a disadvantage because of its design - due to the curve and the distance the clip extends from the phone, I can see this potentially catching on things (seat belts, couches, chairs, etc.) and either breaking the clip entirely, rendering the holster useless and requiring a replacement be purchased OR dislodging the phone from the holster allowing it to fall to the ground.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I believe I finally found the case I have been searching for - the Seidio Active.

3.0,It's Okay,"Purchased for my husband to use with his Droid Razr Maxx. He is very tough on cases and this one seemed capable of standing up to his active work days. The phone fits well when naked (no case). I purchased a TPU cover for him which was put on the phone and then put the phone in this holster. Technically, it fits.. but it is a royal pain to remove from the holster now. He knows he must have a protective cover of some kind on his phone and he really prefers the holster style case.. so our search continues for the best combination for him. I gave it 3 stars because it does work, but docked 2 stars as it will not accomodate the Maxx with any cover on it (which the majority of the population do prefer).<br /><br />Bottom line: this case does indeed fit the Droid Razr Maxx very well. It simply does not leave any room for a protective cover to be simultaneously installed on the phone.",1373322129000,0,True
3.0,Port covers wear out after a few months,"Purchased 2 Otterbox Commuter Cases for both my husband's Razr Maxx and mine. Just received them.. and I got mine on without too much hassle. The inner rubber layer required a little wiggling to get the port protection flaps to lay just right and getting the phone (with the inner layer on) into the hard outer shell took a bit of coercing, but that proved to me that this case is fit perfectly for my phone, as described.<br /><br />The number one feature of this case that I absolutely love and appreciate is that the charging location is fully accessible *without* having to remove the case. I have had too many cases for other phones in the past which required the case be removed in order to charge the phone. I also like the company's warranty. I hope I never have to use it. but glad it's there for that unplanned catastrophic event. Thank you, Otterbox!<br /><br />I see this case serving as a wonderful protector for my expensive Razr Maxx for as long as I have it.. but I will update this review if any problems come up. From what I have experienced with my Otterbox Commuter Case so far.. I would highly recommend it mainly for the superb fit, charging access and the company's lifetime warranty.<br /><br />Update:<br />My husband and I have come to terms with our Otterbox cases. They are simply too thick and add too much bulk to an already sizable phone. Also, the silicone port covers/flaps have stopped seating properly and have began to tear off from the rest of the inner silicone liner (and this is without ever removing the case after first receiving it - so I know it is not caused by repeated installs and removals).. they pop out of place all the time when removing the phone from a purse or a holster which has lead to a noticeable amount of dust build up in the ports they were meant to protect.<br /><br />We have removed them from our phones and, after lengthy research and ordering multiple other cases, we have settled on the following cases as our replacements:<br /><br />Husband's Razr Maxx - [[ASIN:B007PPYXME Seidio BD2-HK3MTRMK-BK ACTIVE Combo with Metal Kickstand for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br />My Razr Maxx - [[ASIN:B007UNHTSG Seidio BD2-HK3MTRMK-PR ACTIVE Case and Holster Combo with Metal Kickstand for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Combo Pack - Retail Packaging - Amethyst]]<br /><br />I love that we were able to find suitable, and comparable, cases that are offered in a choice of colors. Something that I have been waiting for Otterbox to do, but it seems that they will have no plans of ever doing for any phone other than a very select few. This makes is possible to, at a glance, differentiate between our two otherwise identical phones.",1364348341000,0,True

There were many to choose from, but I chose this set because there were two sets, so I could also use the charger in another place. That won't be happening now since I only have one plug and the original.<br />A day later... The other plug failed.

5.0,"Snaps Right on, Perfect!","Snaps right on and is a perfect fit for my Samsung A03s phone. To realize why I am so excited is that this replaced a piece of garbage I purchased before this one.

The previous one did not cover the screen completely and thus the screen allowed dust and lint onto the edges of the screen. This screen cover snaps on and completely encases the screen safely, then the protective back fits right over the phone. To me, this is the PERFECT CASE AND SCREEN COVER.

Unfortunately, they do not fit on the Charge 3 and the plastic band that came with it, caused skin irritation, so I went looking for a mesh band.<br />This mesh band is absolute junk! Do you want to risk a $200 Fitbit on this band? Well, foolishly I did and now I am out of a Fitbit that I cannot afford to replace.<br />Zero stars would be a better rating and don't you dare Seller to respond to this and say I did not attach it properly because there is only one way to attach it.

The cover is quite thick and I knew if it didn't take the charge through it, I would need to return the charging pad. But it does and that makes for an easy charge. If you choose to, you can plug the charger into a 'fast charge adapter', such as the one that came with my phone originally and get the charge faster if you need to.

My phone was at 45% battery and it stated it would take more than 5 hours to completely charge. Seriously? My charger that came with the Samsung S7 fully charges in that amount in less than an hour. No more chances! I bought an INIU Power Bank at the same time as the Uni-Yeap and that one works fine.

Also needed to purchase separately at Radio Shack a charger adapter as the one included with the w800i ( i for international ) is for European use only! Amazon does not involve itself with third party vendors (understood) but our two phone conversations with Ace Digital in Brooklyn were unpleasant to say the least. Very rude and uncooperative.

It's a great design though and the phone sits snug as a bug in it.  It will definitely keep the phone protected too.  I bought it for my gal and she's really tough on phones - landscaper that keeps it in her hip cargo pocket.  Her complaint is that her cards fall out if she's not careful and that really shouldn't be.... but, if you're looking for a cheap product to carry your phone around protected, this product looks great too.

5.0,"Absolutely saves phones, warranty could be clearer.","Great product.  It absolutely does what it's supposed to do.  It completely absorbs the energy of any incident.

If you buy it, it will break the first time you drop your phone on it's face or hit it on its edge.  That's what it's supposed to do!  It absorbs the energy so your phone's actual touchscreen doesn't.<br /><br />The warranty replacement is somewhat confusing so let me make it simple.  The warranty is for 2 replacements per purchase.  When something happens to your screen protector don't throw away the old screen protector before you take a picture of it!!!!

Buy a phone from a more commonly known carrier instead, and have someone help you set up the phone to be easier to use. It will likely be easier to use than this one. Someone thought this was a good idea. Just looking at it, I don't think it lives up to that good idea.

I used a ball to ball adapter because this was extraordinary inexpensive when I ordered it. Using the phone holder from an Arkon phone mount with my Galaxy S9, it allows me to have the phone father from the dash, and easier to reach. It works fine with both, but it really isn't any more solid. The suction cup is larger, so it doesn't fit in the same space. All of the Arkon sticky mounts work well on slightly textured plastic.

My ear fits these too well.<br /><br />Be aware that this headset appears to no longer be fully supported online. Plantronics is now Poly. I just downloaded the latest version of Plantronics Hub from Poly's support site, which appears to be the remnants of Plantronics support site. When I run the Plantronics Hub and try to update the headset I get, ""Plantronics Hub is unable to connect to the server."" I suspect that the update server no longer exists, though I can't be sure. The most recent firmware version is v.109, and may be the last one. That doesn't take away from the quality and usefulness of the headset at all. It's still the best noise-cancelling headset I can comfortably wear. Driving a truck I wear one all the time.<br /><br />Having said all that, I have had issues with some of the ones I've purchased more recently, and my wife has too. Some of them don't cancel noise as well as others, though they all come up as the same product, and the same firmware version. Early on, they were all flawless. Lately, they're not. We've had a couple that failed before we managed to destroy them ourselves. And it's possible that more modern devices don't connect as well to the older version of bluetooth these support.

1.0,Magnants are not strong enough to hold phone in.,My husband ordered for my Galaxy J7 Prime 2017 the gold glitter case and it is very pretty. BUT it is very fat with the two cards department card sleeves. And that's ok if you don't mind it bring fat. I had the Dreem brand wallet case for a iPhone 7+ and the magnant was VERY strong BUT this phone the magnant was VERY week. I put my phone in it and could tell immediately it was too weak of a magnant to hold the phone safe during a drop. I gave the wallet a couple (not too hard) shakes and the phone fell out and on the ground. And the case that the phone sits in is a good snug fit and the back of it is the same cute gold glitter. But the cut out for the power button is hard to push being that it's a little bit too small. It's not a safe wallet case for a phone no matter how cute it is.,1511910643270,0,False

I really never expected this high a level of customer service. I highly recommend purchasing from them--whatever the issue they seem dedicated to making it right! They also left a response as follows: ""When installing Skinomi Tech-skins you do not need to wait the full 12-24 hours for the screen to set by the way. Most of our customers simply wait overnight or 2-3 hours is more than sufficient. Please note you do not need a lot of solution for the screen to install well. A fine but even layer is keep to a good install. The solution itself is completely harmless Next, rather than laying the screen down all at once. Try laying it down from one side to another slowly. This will help prevent any large bubbles or imperfections from occurring. Finally, any excess bubbles or micro bubbles should disappear within 2-3 days!""<br /><br />My previous review: I found the instructions clear and packaging very good, however, the cleaning cloth was not included. I also only received 1 skin--I was under the impression that I would receive several. This seems to be a good product but I was overall disappointed since I did not get everything I paid for. Also, be aware that the manufacturer recommends waiting 12-24 hours after application of the skin before turning your phone back on so it's best to install in the evening before bed so you have use of your phone during the day!",1330434948000,1,True

There are a lot of fantastic Parks and great Rivers just a bit further East and still in Maryland but NatGeo didn't want to give up the extra quads to include these areas since they also include Delaware. Shame on you NatGeo! Cheap and greedy of you. I would have gladly paid a few extra bucks to have the MD's Eastern Shore and the Delaware Shore included with the DC/Balto region.

It looks good, great for the price and offers great protection from dropping; however, Siri doesn’t hear me as well. The speaker isn’t covered, but the rubber layer is so thick that it creates kind of a tunnel for the speaker, making it difficult to hear my voice. If I speak right into the speaker, I have no problems. This is the only flaw I’ve had, and it doesn’t stop me from using the cover.

1.0,After 10 months this phone has crapped out.,"The phone works properly and was easy to set up through our Net10 account.  Adding a memory card was simple as was installing SIM cards.  I'm not too sure about having a non replaceable battery, we'll just have to see how long it lasts.  One star off for the picture and video quality.  It is noticeably lesser quality than my previous Samsung phone.  It is adequate, not excellent in that department.<br /><br />UPDATE 6-10-2016:  After 10 months this phone has crapped out.  The menu and home buttons now only vibrate and do nothing else.  This was after I was forced to do a factory reset because the phone all of a sudden refused to open past an Alcatel splash screen...<br />This phone was used very little, never saw anything close to abuse, and had no additional software installed except for the endless automatic updates for the pre-installed apps the phone would initiate every time it was hooked to WiFi.  This quickly ate up the phone's internal memory, regardless of having a 16Gb memory card installed (phone only comes with 2Gb internal memory).  This kept me in a continuous cycle of shutting down apps that CAME WITH THE PHONE.  Their warranty stinks and is very unyielding.  When we called support they immediately sent us to the return page.  Yeah, read THAT.  This phone carries my HOME phone number, but they have no reservations of having you go without a phone for 10 days while they determine whether it is your fault or theirs.

It just means I have to take it out of the case when I use that particular charger, which is a little tough to do. The magnet is quite weak and that would be my only real complaint. it doesn't pop open, but it feels like it will come unlatched easily. It holds my debit card, driver's license, and cash. Can't store too many bills in cash though or the gets pretty thick, and that's where I'm worried that the magnet will fail.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I bought it.",1471357677000,2,True

5.0,Excellent choice!,I chose the Anker multi-angle portable stand for tablets when I began following a new nutrition plan for 2014.  I needed my tablet in an upright position to read recipes and cooking instructions from various websites. This stand is perfect for just that!  It is sturdy and prevents my tablet from tipping over or falling off the counter. If I were to use the charging stand for the tablet the cord gets in the way and it requires me to use one of the kitchen outlets.

My screen has never cracked using the provided fitted screen protector. However, I have two problems.  the new case I just received is faulty. The front right side seems to have excess material at the top and bottom that isn’t letting it wrap securely and tightly on my phone. I’ve had this issue before but due to my own user error, as I placed the screen too far over causing the case to not fit. This time it is the case itself. Really bummed about this especially because as I was putting it on I noticed that this case is causing damage to the sides on my phone I wish I could get a picture of. Tiny chips of paint being taken off I imagine due to the case snapping on and off because of falls, or even when I sit down with it in my pocket. They are tiny chips but clearly adding up since I am a repeated user of this phone case 😔 with these two issues I imagine I’ll be in the market for a different phone case in the future.",1565755938768,0,True

Overall, it's a budget friendly option if you need flexible spine protection.",1645653538211,0,True
5.0,Buy This Case!,"This is the case you want.  I bought the slimmer version made by Spigen and it was truly flimsy and not designed well.  This case is rugged, feels dense and sturdy, protects the essential drop points, and isn't too pricey.  The hinge cover is designed well, but it prevents you from laying the phone down on a flat surface (makes a see-saw).  The two pieces of the case adhere to the phone by small adhesive pads.  In my case, at least three of the little stickers ended up getting pulled off when I tried to remove the plastic strip covers.  The case is still very well adhered to the phone due to the tight fit of the design.  This case feels like it should be shipped with the phone, it checks every block I have.  In the other Spigen case, the only charger I could use was the cord supplied with the phone, whereas this case has more room for third party charging cables.  The finish is matte satin and surprisingly does not attract dirt and oil when used in a normal environment or placed in a linty pocket.  The only minor flaw is how close the case gets to the screen area.  On the front screen, the case almost makes swiping down for notifications a real pain.  The solution to this is to swipe down from where the case has a section cut out for the camera, as it gives the screen more room to recognize your finger.  Some minor dust and dirt may accumulate in the areas where the case meets the screen, but this is still not a huge hassel to wipe away with a t-shirt or microfiber cloth.  The inside screen area has the same deep ledge which sometimes limits swipes from the bottom, but it happens mostly when I'm not paying attention to the phone.  While the case is obviously a bit chunky, I believe it is still the best case on the market for this phone right now.",1611951502534,0,True

2.0,Not Recommended.,"I saw another review for this ultra hybrid case which showed the front of the case having a very slim piece of plastic on the left edge.  I am buying a new case right now because that one left side piece of plastic is so flimsy.  I hate that this case also seems to collect lint and small hair underneath.  This case also does not allow the phone to sit flat on a table when open, the left half of the case is thinner than the right half.  This creates a small ""rocking"" when typing on the left side of the screen.  Lastly, the opening for the charger is small, meaning it is not likely to accept a charger other than the one that shipped with the phone.  I don't recommend this case unless the design issues are addressed and the price goes down.",1610736414464,0,True
4.0,"Sturdy, some minor cons","This case is one of the few I have found for the Fold 2 that doesn't feel awkward and fragile.  There are a few negative sides to this case, though. I do not like how thick the phone becomes when using the case with cards and my IDs.  It also worries me that the magnets in the case closure are kinda close to my cards, which could mess up the magnetic strip. Also, the case doesn't really have a self-stand-up feature, which feels like a missed opportunity.  Still, despite these cons, the case is a good choice for someone who wants to combine their wallet and phone without concern for how bulky it becomes.",1610731540128,0,True
4.0,"Matte finish, faded over time","I purchased this anti-glare screen protector to give my screen a more ‘matte’ finish.  I thought it would look nicer and more unique than the standard glossy fingerprint-riddled surface.  It does feel like a strong protector, and it was very easy to install with the instructions and included sticker tools.  Do not expect a perfect installation, but if you take your time and use the stickers provided, you’ll get most of the dust off of the screen so that there are no bubbles.  I subtracted a star because the matte finish of the protector seems to have faded with use.  It might be the natural oils of my hands and face, but it is significant enough that I feel the product could be improved.  I’ve seen other matte screen protectors with a more porous surface which leads to a longer lasting finish.  Overall, does a great job to protect against scratches.  This does not protect against cracks, so buy a case as well.",1520886965397,0,True

The lip on the front of the case is only about a millimeter or so, but it serves to help protect the screen if dropped on a flat surface.

This is a fantastic case for the money and definitely protects from scratches and dents to the back and sides of the phone, but does not protect against far drops.  I haven't dropped my phone yet, so I'm not speaking from experience.  Also, this case does not block any ports or speakers, so you still have full access to all the features of your phone.  I plan on buying at least one more of these cases in black.  The clear version starts to look a little 'tan' after prolonged exposure to dirt/dust/dirty hands.

I had to go back and add letters that I missed because it didnt pick up my touche.<br /><br />Second, I had to remove my glass screen protector because it absolutely wasnt picking up any kind of touche with that on and then the otterbox plastic screen over that.  I removed the $40 glass protector that I had on, then realized that the plastic otterbox screen was crap.  Great.<br /><br />I finally, out of frustration, removed the plastic otterbox screen by peeling it off of the case.  It was easy to do and MUCH better now.

I went to Verizon and they wanted to charge me $65 to put one on and I decided to give it another shot and glad I did.

I am definitely feeling better in my hand by doing this.  My other phone case held my money and cards too and may have been too large for my hand and causing more problems as I constantly carried it.

1.0,A hard case and not protective enough,"This is a hard case that will definitely not last.  It doesn't come around to protect the screen enough and the case (as seen in other reviews), doesn't snap together on one corner.  These cases need to be rubberized and even the rubberized one they have for casio seems too hard.  We haven't been able to find a case for casio gzone commando 4g lte that is nice or protective.  I know the phone is supposed to be good on it's own, but it's nice to help keep the dust out of cracks and to give a little further protection, after all the deductible for our insurance is $100.  And the cases help personalize.  Stickers are just not an option for us.  We want a quality case for this phone and can't believe, Casio doesn't have any, plus the attachment for a wrist strap should also be available since their is a location for it but no accessory and we haven't found any wrist strap that would attach because the eyelets are too small.

5.0,Protective and quality product,We don't mind some bulk when our phone is protected.  My last droid x had a seidio case and the case & phone were still in great shape at the end of 4 years.  This one feels very similar to the seidio & a rare quality case since the lg g2 from Verizon is so difficult to find a case for.  We tried many cases and returned all but 2 since we had 2 phones.  This one was made with quality and protective for the entire phone.  It comes around the front far enough to protect the lense and has a rubber plastic combination for protection.  I like the rubber buttons in the back making it easier to push the on off screen or volume and it grips well and looks nice.  I don't know why they have so many stupid childish designs on this case but they have enough of the better colors.<br /><br />It also comes with a screen saver made for this case which we realized needed to be applied with the case installed so that you know where the screen saver needs to be and the case then doesn't put pressure on the screen saver causing it to bubble.  My husband got the screen saver on right and it all works together great!  The screen saver fits just inside the case perfectly.

I've had mine on my droid x for 2 years and have dropped it many times and never damaged my phone although a couple of corners have broken on the case, it is still very usable and doesn't fall apart or give any problems.  Several layers keep the phone cradled and safer and the case does not interfere with any of the phones capabilities.  I love the way it keeps my camera lens safe and covered.

4.0,Wish side arms and foot were longer,"When I first purchased this holder my phone fit fine and the holder did just that, it held.  I also decided to add a finger ring on my phone.  This was a great concept because the phone doesn't slip out of my hand, (I highly recommend the ring)  Unfortunately, the ring hits the back of the holder which prematurely closes the arms and I have to use both hands to adjust the phone to fit in the holder.  If the side arms and foot were even 1/4"" longer it wouldn't be a problem.<br />I installed it on my windshield and it really stuck.  Unfortunately (again) I had to move it.  Now the suction cup cannot be re-stuck.  Wish there was a replacement sticky pad for the cup.  I'm pretty handy and can improvise a fix for the arm length as well as sticking problem...just wish I didn't have to.<br />I like the fact that the holder does not block accessory ports on my phone.

5.0,High Quality & Great Purchase,"LThis case is a high quality and durable protection for your iPhone! I don’t like Otter Boxes because they are so big and bulky. This case is very slender and not very bulky. I like that it has the holster clip and you can slide your phone it with the speaker facing towards the ceiling or the floor. This is perfect for me as a restaurant manager - when I’m on the line cooking I face my speaker down to the floor so I don’t get any drips or crumbs in it and when I’m in the office or on the floor I face the speaker up towards the ceiling so I can hear it better. You cannot face the screen out, but that is for your phones protection.<br />  Even the stand works great (standing up and on side) and is durable. I don’t use it much because I don’t like that you cannot adjust the angle. It stands the phone almost straight up and down. My personal preference is just a slight angle for playing my games. Not a bad thing by any means, just a preference issue.",1541613795218,3,True
5.0,Sparkly Band!!,The band is absolutely gorgeous! It is very sparkly when it catches the light and has a pretty mix of colors. The only drawback is that it does tend to catch on your sleeve. My Husband also complains that it scratches him when we hug and snuggle.,1541613218267,0,True

5.0,Nice option for my Galaxy Watch 4,"I just got a new Galaxy Watch 4 and the band that came with it was a new design for me.  The end of the band tucked into the inside of the band rather than outside like a traditional watch band.<br />While that was nice, it was more difficult for me to get the watch off quickly so I started looking for other types of bands<br />This one caught my eye and it was also ""no gap"" which means the top of the strap which connects to the body of the watch was curved so that there was no gap between the band and the watch.  Now, I didn't know that was either a feature or a problem, all my other watches and bands had always had that gap, but this was an interesteing feature and this band had it, so I gave it a try.<br />I had also purchased some additional bands that were not No Gap  and I didn't like the color of the band that came with the watch. That means I had the original band and a few more to compare to this band.<br />The packaging is a bit odd with some questionable grammar choices, but overall I really liked the band.  It is made of a flexible material that fits well and I can adjust it to be more snug or loose as needed.<br />The only thing I had a slight problem with was the fact that the end of the band was outside the watch and could get caught.<br />That's right, the very reason I got this one was the one feature I had problems with.  I fixed the problem easily by sliding the little holding straps closer to the end of the band.  In this kind of flexible band the end does stick out and can get caught on things, but the benefits outweigh this little problem.<br />Overall, I'm very happy with the band, it makes it much easier to do the EKG, Stress anf O2 levels since it has a more snug fit.  If you are looking for a nice band, this one is well worth considering.",1677030578909,0,False
5.0,Works Great - Finally Wireless Android Auto,"I've used Android Auto for at least the last 5-6 years and it's always been annoying that you can't use it wirelessly.  The newer cars have the wireless option, but for those of us with cars that don't have that option, this device is great.<br />When connecting with a wire, sometimes it gets tangled, or if you need to use the phone to pay for something in a drive thru and often this disconnects the AA.  With this device, you just plug it in, connect it via Bluetooth and away you go.  No need to rearrange it, and it also reconnects the next time you get in the car, so it takes the hassle out of AA.<br />It comes with two USB connections, the device has a USB C connection and so it has a USB - C to USB - A and also a USB -C to USB - C cable so you can hook it up either way.<br />It's a bit pricey at $99 and I think there is another one that may be cheaper, but this one works which is worth a few extra bucks.<br />I can definitely recommend it if you want to get rid of the cables.  Another benefit is that the Android Auto connection, at least in the two cars I use doesn't charge the phone very well, so with the wireless you can plug the phone into a fast charger and use Bluetooth for AA and you are good to go.",1675031156500,0,False
5.0,Someone finally got it right,"I've tried multiple devices to hold my phone in the car.  I've tried the ones that fit in the cup holder, the ones that have a goose neck that positions the phone at an odd angle, the ones that stick to your dashboard, and then I settled on an air vent holder that I got free at a trade show.  It didn't work very well, but I liked the concept so I started looking for others.<br />I found one that was ok, but it blocked the air vent and would occasionally fall off.  I looked at the reviews and features and liked the fact that it has a little hook to attach it to the vent and also it said that it didn't block the vent.  Well, I've heard that before so I didn't have much hope that I could use the air vent, but the hook seemed like a great addition so I ordered it.<br />I've been very happy, it stays on, it is not a hassle to take off if I want to and yes, it really does not block the flow of air from the vent.  It sticks out a bit, but that's why it doesn't block the vent  I also like the little button on the back that releases the phone.  You just put the phone in the device, and then push the sides in to hold it.  When you want to take it out, there is a button on the back which is easy to get to and it releases the side holders.<br />So, if you are looking for this kind of device, then I can highly recommend this one.  It's been great and I've used it almost daily for several weeks.",1629403982410,2,True

I sent feedback and was told that it was designed that way because the S7 (not the S7 Edge) had a curved screen.  While that is true, the screen protector doesn't cover enough of the screen to really protect it.<br />I responded again and again they tried to explain to me that was the way it was designed.  Finally, after multiple back and forth, they gave me a full refund of the product price and also shipping.<br />I'm giving the product 5 start, not because it is a good product, but because the company stood behind a bad product and I appreciate that.  Once they figure out how to create a screen protector with curved edges I will consider repurchasing it.",1459292207000,1,True

5.0,Unbelievable protection.,"For a long time now, this has been required phone protection for every single one of my family members.<br /><br /> I have three kids. They can’t afford to repair their own phones. After more than enough costly screen replacements, I did the research and found the OtterBox defender.<br /><br /> Because I like different colors, I have probably bought about 10 of these over the years. They all held up and they all protected my phone and my family members’ phones from unbelievable levels of clumsiness and abuse. Once I even accidentally dropped my phone out of a second-story window onto my asphalt driveway. The phone suffered no damage whatsoever.<br /><br />Any phone I am financially responsible for gets dressed in one of these, period.<br /><br />Some people worry that they are bulky. I worried about that myself initially. Interestingly, I now very much like the rubbery edge.  I have used the iPhone 6 since it came out, and the ridge on the outer edge of the OtterBox defender actually makes my phone a lot easier to hold in one hand and to thumb-type on. Does it take up more room in a pocket? Yes. Is it worth it to me? Absolutely.<br /><br /> Sometimes I use the holster/stand accessory, and sometimes I don’t. It’s great to just clamp onto your belt for long walks with the dogs in the woods, etc. Maybe not such a good look for a dinner party.  It’s easy to take off the holster/stand feature with one hand and toss it into a drawer or your purse. Both the clamp and the stand pop-out feature work well and hold up to punishment.<br /><br /> This is one of my very favorite products in the world. And, no, nobody gives me free products or cares whether I review anything or not. I’m just trying to save a few more phone screens out there.",1540397542611,1,False

5.0,Cute but too big,"It was a very pretty watch band but it seemed too big on me. It fit but there was just so much excess band that I didn’t care for how it worked out. I did end up returning it, but the product itself is very nice and I saw nothing wrong with it.",1649090406690,0,True
5.0,Don’t bother with their wipes,"The wet and dry wipes are trash. They left so much lint behind and didn’t really clean the screen well either.

If this one cracks easily as well, I will return to the one I used before this. It came with two for the cost of shipping the free replacement. So replacing that one with a purchase every other swap isn’t that bad. Plus the other brand I used on my previous phone didn’t crack nearly as soon. At a minimum, my phone isn’t cracked and so I guess it is doing its job.<br /><br />For now I’ll be giving it four stars.

1.0,Worst touch screen phone,"Phone has a lot of features for a non-smartphone, but they are rendered useless by an awful phone.<br /><br />Huge Negatives<br /><br />The touch screen is inconsistent. It either is not responsive, or overly responsive. It also misinterprets what I am trying to access when touching the screen.<br />So every time I use this phone I am always jumping in and out of areas I never intended to be in.  And when then phone becomes unresponsive, I cannot leave the areas I never wanted to be in the first place.<br /><br />Another issue with the screen is that it scratches way too easy. Even after getting protectors, it's impossible to see the screen in any sunlight at all.<br /><br />Internet is so slow it's beyond useless and I have cancelled my data plan after just a week of use<br /><br />The phone also will occasionally just freeze up.  Like on a call and you want to hang up .. but the phone will not hang up (had to pull the battery)<br /><br />TMobile will be glad to replace the phone with a new one, but the same problems persist. I can't wait to get out of this piece of junk.<br /><br />===============<br />UPDATE 1yr later<br />===============<br />Still the worst phone I have ever owned .. I hate it<br />I have called TMOBILE every month for 12 months trying to get upgraded .. or anything to get a new phone and got nothing except buy a new phone at above retail prices. I gave up dealing with the phone and TMOBILE. So much for being with TMOBILE for 10+ years.<br />I am counting the days to get out of my contract and will switch to Verizon and iPhone or DROID as soon as I can.<br />Without a real smartphone .. your really missing out on some of the best technology and apps around.",1314018555000,0,False
5.0,Good value,"I can’t speak to the durability question since I only just received the item, but for the price, I have no complaints. The band is probably bonded leather, but looks good. It installed without issue and fits my 44mm 🍎 Watch perfectly. The buckle and hardware are of dark metal, the same color as the ‘space gray’ of my watch and complement the color of the band. The band is pretty stiff when new but undoubtedly will be progressively easier to fasten as it gets broken in. Given the reasonable price, I plan to buy some other colors/styles to add to my collection. 👍",1581370997265,0,True
5.0,Excellent product for the price,"Looks great and fits the iPhone XR perfectly. Precise cutouts for volume up/down, ringer off, power button, speakers and charging port. Folds to allow a 45 degree angle “stand” for viewing in horizontal mode. Three slots for easy access to license, credit cards, etc. and a full height pocket for cash, receipts or whatever else you might want to stuff in there. Excellent value for the price.<br /><br />**edit** The vendor states that the case allows wireless (Qi) charging - I didn’t find that to be true. I was unable to charge my iPhone XR with this case installed using an Insignia 10w Qi pad. The iPhone charges fine using the same pad with the phone out of the case.

5.0,Perfect,"This case perfectly fits my IPhone 5SE. Hard plastic with a hinged lid which easily snaps open and closed. The inside is soft padded rubber and cradles the phone nicely. The screen protector allows access to the touch screen and there's a small button which presses the iPhone's home button. There's also a little porthole window on the bottom/back to allow use of the camera while it's in the case. The handlebar clamp easily swivels to allow portrait or landscape use. About the only thing I can see that someone might want is a way to plugin a set of ear buds but there is no access to allow that. (I suppose you could pretty easily attack it with a small drill bit and make one if you wanted to...) All in all, EXACTLY what I was looking for and at a fraction of the cost of the ones offered at my local bike store.",1496709299000,0,True
5.0,Nice!,"I have to say, for the price I'm pleasantly surprised. This is a good quality case - looks good, feels good and fits my SE like a glove. The main part of the case is a good quality material - I was expecting something more like plastic. The part holding the phone is a soft, rubbery material, and stretches a bit to allow the iPhone to be inserted. Once in place, it holds it very securely. The cover lays perfectly flat against the iPhone and only rises a bit even with credit cards inserted into the two available slots. Included is also a wrist strap which can easily be added to a small eyelet on the spine of the case.",1470245610000,1,True

3.0,Decent case,"The case fits my 4S well and doesn't add too much bulk to the phone. Installation is simple - just pop the phone into the bottom of the case. It fits well and holds the phone securely. All the connectors and buttons are easily accessed with it installed. The case easily allows the phone to sit propped at an angle on its' side but there's nothing but the stiffness of the new leather to keep it in position. I suspect it will not stand up as well when the case gets a little use and loosens up. All in all though, a reasonable product. My only real disappointment is in the quality of the leather which seems pretty cheap. For the money, I was hoping for something of a little nicer quality.",1349910992000,1,True

2.0,Does Not Work Well,"Sadly, this does not work as shown. Don't get me wrong the quality of the product is excellent. I was looking for an alternative to the Otterbox and wallet (men wallet) and thought this is it. It has four slots. One for the DL and three cards. You could probably slide some bills in the slot under the cards on the left side but it will be a pain each time you do it. The problem is that with a DL and three bank cards the wallet has a bulge when you close it and the magnetic closure will not grip and keep it secure. The other problem is that with four cards in this case and you close it it will turn on your cell. I had to change mine to a 15 second screen lock so it would not do that. But, in the end it will have to go back. Sadly, a simple design change of increasing the back binder spacing by twice the width would allow this case to close easily with the cards and cell.",1407600348000,0,True

There is a ballpoint pen inside the barrel so be cautious about that. If you notice tip fraying then, don’t keep using it.

5.0,"The header makes it sound as if this is a 1 item, but they are actually selling 2 different types. Be aware of this before order","I went by the title which said it was contained survival items and could be used as a pill container. I chose this dark green one only because I liked the color the best. When I got it I thought there isn't any room for pills unless you remove the survival items so I guessed (wrongly) that is why it was advertised as a pill container. But when I just went back to the webpage, I noticed that some of the items looked different. That was when I realized there were 2 different items! You can get the one with the survival kit OR you can get one to use as a pill container. I don't know how the size differs. The survival one and the pill one comes in orange or black. Also, this darker forest green has the survival kit and the light neon green is for pills. I'm thinking about putting the survival kit in my knife which has a handle I can unscrew and put things in. Then I'm going to see how many of my pills will fit in this one. I know it won't be as many since there is the side which is kind of cut back (as you can see in this photo). But since it has good feedback for being water resistant (it has an extra O-ring), I will see if I can put some pills my version after taking the survival kit out.<br /><br />Since the survival cut version and the pill version, I would go with the survival version since they are the same price and this version has a rough pad inside you can strike a match on which is handy and you do get the extra items. The pill version is more straight (no curves like this one) and is empty though it also comes with the ring to put a lanyard on and an extra O-ring).<br /><br />Since it is coming overseas, don't expect it right away (so no 2-day delivery Prime members)!

The Dream Pilot kneeboard solves that problem nicely. More specifically, by mounting the ipad-mini on my leg, the ipad-mini doesn't  block any of the flight instruments or the EFIS. In addition, the kneeboard allows me to place the ipad-mini in either landscape or portrait orientation or a large number of angles in-between. Overall, the kneeboard is an outstanding device.

5.0,Protected my phone once -- Buying this again,"I'm sold. I put this protector on shortly after buying the iPhone 6 Plus. Not only was it easy to install, it has protected the face of the phone from the grip of my niece, who will take an item in perfect condition and return it broken but never knows how it got that way. Anyway, imagine my disappointment when she hands me my phone with a big crack across its face. However, what appeared to be a crack was a crack or a scratch in the ballistics glass. I'm pretty sure it saved my phone from being cracked. In need of a new screen protector, I cheaped out and bought the Tech Armor HD Clear screen protector 3-pack from Amazon. I see why they come in a 3-pack: you will ruin 2 screen protectors before placing one on well enough to be satisfied with. It also doesn't seem to offer a lot of protection. I'm going back to the HD Clear Ballistic Glass.",1425768639000,0,True

I've had one similar to this in the past and liked it pretty good (until the paint came off the red case simply putting it in and out of my back pocket.

I figured they'd be the clear acrylic that scratches so easily. The 9H is a good hardness, especially if you're not a dropper and especially especially if it's in a sturdy drop-protection case.<br /><br />Most people use the ring on the back for their finger; I use mine to attach my keys (I have a very small carbines on my keychain or else I'd still be digging in the bottom of my bag from going out yesterday.",1675964435005,0,True

And he ***has to have*** a phone - not just for us to be able to reach him or locate him when he decides to walk the property or get on his tractor or head into town, but because he likes taking pictures & videos and YouTube ain't gonna watch itself/solitaire ain't gonna play itself (😜). Dad catches his phone about once a year, sometimes twice if he's got weather that permits a lot of time on his 'farm toys'. In the past I've had to pay about half for a holster what I'd pay for the original phone case (and those were a lot of money years back, before comparable quality cases for wayyyyy less were saturating the market). We were honestly pretty excited to find two for what I last paid for just one of these holsters. Quality is equivalent to the higher dollar ones.",1618656754101,0,True
5.0,Christmas gift (from my Mom) for my Dad,"The Amazon Premium Renewed gets 5 stars all on its own. If you can find a device with that, pay the extra (from 'just' Amazon Renewed) and get it! Also, absolutely cannot tell the phone was ever pre-owned or pre-used!!<br /><br />The iPhone XR was an upgrade gift for my Dad from my Mom. His old device was an iPhone 6. He takes ALOT of photos. Every truck show, every tractor show, every time the grands are around, and all the weird bugs... he has pics - lol. And his iPhone 6 (8GB! Lol) ran into a conundrum: It was full of photos, so it didn't have space for his updates. And because it couldn't update, he couldn't upload his photos to the cloud. Also, he wanted a bigger screen. (I'm the same, why put on glasses when you can just have a bigger screen 🤷🏼‍♀️).<br /><br />I honestly thought that the 'swipe the screen away' feature - replacing the home button - would drive him up the wall. He hasn't said a word! (BEEEEELIEVE me... he's at that wonderful, fully liberated age where he says whatever he thinks and does 👊🏻 not 👊🏻 care). He truly loves this phone! Score 1 for technology when an OG Baby Boomer embraces the ease of use, transitioning up (what?) 4 years in advancements and upgrades AND LIKES IT!!",1613134049075,0,True
5.0,Works with Otterbox cases with belt holster...,"My Dad is a ""boomer"" - as a reminder, that's the ones born between 1946-1964 (he was *almost* The Greatest Generation... which explains why he is so awesome... but I digress) - and he likes his phone in a case, in a holster that it clios firmly onto his belt. (Probably didn't have to mention the was a Baby Boomer with all the indications in that last sentence - lol) He saw a PopSocket) on my sister's and niece's iPhones and I guess banked it in his memory. When Mom gave Daddy a new iPhone XR with the bigger screen we knew he needed the OtterBox case - he's out there practically 4x4'ing in his big D53 dozer and his phone stays put in the holster, clipped to his belt. Anyway, because his new phone is much bigger than his old 6, he was having trouble - even with his big manliest man hands - holding the phone with one hand. He asked me to get him ""what your sister and Emily"" have and I did and it is perfect. He can still holster his phone soundly, and it helps him hold it like a champion while he's walking around and talking on speakerphone. So easy to apply the popsocket I wasn't even asked to do it for him!",1612108190746,0,True
5.0,Doesn't muffle volume like other brands,"Got for my Dad's new (to him) iPhone XR. He likes the durability of the Otterbox and he likes that they come with the optional clip-on belt holster. He uses his phone on speaker all the time - he's hard of hearing - and some cases can muffle or damper the volume coming from the speakerphone. This case does not; it blew me away today when he was using the phone in my kitchen today. (I have an older iPhone and the faux life proof case and even after taking a drill bit to the bottom, I still cannot hardly hear when my phone is on speaker. Literally take a Bluetooth with me just about everywhere bc the speaker is worthless with my case.)",1611530270957,2,True
5.0,One stupid tiny bubble from Hades would NOT come out!,"However, it is only seen when the phone is black screen (turned off). My Dad hasn't noticed it yet and he's been toting his phone for over two weeks. Got for my Dad's new iPhone XR because the Otterbox Defender for his model doesn't come with the clear, thin, acrylic screen protector built in anymore. (He cracked the screen on his old phone twice so not sure they were actually doing much anyway). I was the one that applied this micro thin glass screen protector and was honestly surprised-bordering-on-shocked at how simple this application was with this kit. All but one of the bubbles simply swiped away with a credit card and light-medium pressure and it's practically invisible.",1610630259731,0,True
5.0,He LOVES it!!,"Obviously cannot rate durability - it literally just arrived today - but he wanted something a little less tight and a little less sport casual than the last ones I ordered for him (I will review those as well, so check my reviews for the multi pack of silicone sporty bands for Apple Watch 3 Series if you're interested). He said he had to remove a link and it was super easy; he wondered, even, why all watches don't come with little kits to adjust the band/bracelet like this one did. He said he liked the little cover that dressed up his Apple Watch and he really REALLY likes how chic (my word) this band made the watch look - dressy enough for the office yet he still wore it, comfortably, while he ran some this evening.<br /><br />If anything changes, I will most assuredly update the review.",1609376228867,1,True

5.0,Very Highly Recommend!,"With the Samsung Galaxy 8 Plus it was hard to find Screen Protectors that fit and stayed on. They were not going to help if they were just popping off for no reason. I tried and returned several before buying iAnder.<br /><br />iAnder does everything it promises and exceeds my expectations! Proper fit, stays on, very durable, great price, love the 2 pack, screen is not affected by touch or halo/shadow like others, and comes with cleaning kit and installation tray.<br /><br />Im very hard on phones!<br />Ive dropped my phone face down on gravel. I couldnt tell if the phone screen was cracked underneath the shattered protector that was still attached firmly. I had to remove the protector that still had great adhesion, but was still held together even though completely shattered.  I didnt have to worry about being cut, the protector comes off in 1 piece .My phone was still perfectly fine!!<br /><br />I had one protector that after each fall would have a small crack by the edge,  but I didnt replace it until after the 6th fall when the crack was across the screen and I could no longer see the screen.  But even with small cracks, it never affected the touch or view.<br /><br />First thing is, Protectors vary, so follow the installation instructions.  Comes with cleaning kit, installation tray, and has easy and thorough instructions. I place a new protector at night. I place phone  on flat sturdy surface, turn off my phone so that the glass is not being jostled by vibration, getting dirt and lint from hands and pockets etc. The next morning, put on the case and go. This always helps the adhesion process.<br />If you need to have your phone on, turn off vibrate, try to let the phone sit for a while without being moved around.<br /><br />EDIT- 11/8/2019  I just purchased these again. I have one from last time, but ots hiding from me so I ordered more.  Again, my phone was dropped often, on tile, gravel,  concrete etc. This time not only was the screen area cracked here and there, but there were 3 yes 3 big cracks on the negative edge (round part where glass ends on outer edge) that splintered out, up and down. I was sure it was my phone that was cracked and not just the protector. I could still use the phone with zero problems even with the cracks. I dreaded removing the protector and seeing a damaged phone. I had to use muscle to get protector off , and had to clean the phone well to remove some adhesive left behind,  but my phone is fine! I could not believe it!<br /><br />This protector saved my phone even when I dropped it and it hit cement and gravel face down, on the side and edge of phone 3 times. Thats not including the countless other falls/drops, But those 3 were hard crashes! I honestly thought the entire phone would shatter on those.<br /><br />Im on my 4th package of protectors. The average person would likely be on their first package. Like I said before,  I am very very rough on phones.<br /><br />This protector is great! Its Saved my phone from literally, hundreds of falls.<br />Highly recommend",1564152719852,14,True

4.0,Keeps Electronics Organized,"There never seems to be enough charging cords in my house. They get moved, placed in drawers, and otherwise misplaced right when we need them. It’s good to have the right cord for the specific electronic and a cord that cannot get lost, while also keeping things organized when you have a large number of devices to charge and this is where a charging station like this one can help.<br /><br />The best feature of this charging station is that it includes cords to accommodate different electronics, and that includes apple and Samsung. It takes a little assembly effort to get it ready, but once you’re finished, the slots are ready to handle your different electronics. The apple and usb cords make it efficient in this manner.<br /><br />This charging station does seem to charge a little faster than using our usual cords, so that is a plus. If you happen to live where power surges are commonplace, I recommend plugging it into a surge strip. It’s best not to take chances, especially if you have a large number of items plugged in.<br /><br />I like what I have experienced with this charging station. The only issue I have with the slots is that some electronics are too tall to fit. My ipad is one such item. Other than this annoyance, this charging station from Catlyn is good for households with varied electronics, since it helps charge many different devices at once and keeps things organized.",1676057675202,0,False
5.0,Fast Charging Ability,"It can never hurt to have more charging cords available. With so many electronics in my home, we are always looking for charging cords and we often misplace them. To keep the iPad going strong, I decided to get this Galvanox PPS GaN Charger.<br /><br />This charge is like most others. The cord itself is detachable from the head of the plug, which means you can leave the head inserted into a socket, unplug the cord itself, and use it elsewhere. We often do this when we charge electronics in the car.<br /><br />You do get reasonably fast charging with this cord. With our ipad, it charges it at the rate of about 2 to 3 percent per minute, which is more than fast enough to meet our charging needs. I tend to leave charging cords plugged in, but if you need to unplug and store, just roll it up and place it in a drawer until your next use.<br /><br />With the proliferation of electronics, it is important to have the means to change readily available. This Galvanox Charger is quite good at its intended task and it earns an easy recommendation from me.",1675007529574,0,False
5.0,Compact and Gets the Job Done,"Smartphones and iPhones are found in the pockets and purses of most every person in the USA. We need to stay connected and we need our phones powered and ready to go. When juice is needed and there is no electrical outlet nearby, you need a backup plan and that is what you get with this SAFUEL Portable Charger.<br /><br />Straight from the package, this power bank already had about 80 percent charge available, so there was no need to plug it in, but I did so anyway, just to see how quickly it would get to the 100 percent mark. It took only about 30 minutes to add those other 20 percentage points of charge, which is a pretty good rate of charge overall. And for charging your phone, it uses about 35 percent of its power to charge my phone all the way, from zero to 100 percent, which again is good.<br /><br />I love having a digital readout on a phone charger because I know precisely how much juice remains. This power bank is cool for another reason: It has a pull- out stand, on which you can place your phone while it charges, for easy viewing.<br /><br />This charger is smaller than most others but don’t let the size fool you. SAFUEL has put great effort into this phone charger, showing that it is a market leader in this type of technology. It’s a handy, practical charging device and one you don’t want to leave home without.",1649961082904,0,False
5.0,Keep Your Electronics Powered and Ready,"Electronics are all around us and at the very least, most of us at least own a smartphone or iphone. No one wants to get caught with a phone that has lost its charge and, luckily, there are power banks ready to step in when needed. Manufacturers keep getting better and better with power banks and an excellent choice is this SAFUEL Power Bank.<br /><br />Straight from the package, this power bank already has a good deal of available charge, so you can use it immediately. It has a digital display which is far superior to the power banks of old, most of which indicated the available power by displaying either one, two, three, or four bars of light which forced you to guess. There is no doubt how much power remains with this power bank. The percentage is right there, before your eyes.<br /><br />This is a fast- charging power bank. From my own tests, I found that it takes about 17 minutes to add 10 percentage points of charge. So, at that rate, the power bank can be charged completely in about 2.5 to 3 hours. It charges phones quickly also. Plug your phone into this power bank and you will find that, for a smartphone like I have, it takes about 3 percent of the power bank to add 10 percent to the phone. That’s a ratio of about three to one, which means this power bank, when fully charged, can completely charge three smartphones like mine.<br /><br />We need our electronics for work and to stay connected. We cannot afford to have our electronics lose their power and this power bank from SAFUEL is ready to make sure you have the power when you need it most. It charges quickly and keeps your phone or other device going for the duration.",1649705947377,0,False
5.0,SAFUEL is Ready When You Need It,"In the electronic age, cell phones, tablets, and other electronics are a part of everyday life. We rely on them to keep us connected with others and often need them for our jobs. You can’t take a chance on your electronics losing power and a device that is ready to keep you safe is this SAFUEL Portable Charger.<br /><br />I have used many portable chargers in my day but SAFUEL ranks among the very best for several reasons. I like the flat, slim design. It is shaped like a smartphone and that means it is easily portable in the same way that a smartphone is easily portable. You can fit this in your pants pocket, in the outside of a backpack, even in your shirt pocket without any problem. Next, I like the digital readout. With some portable chargers, all you get is a set of four bars to tell you how much power remains. With this, you know precisely what percentage of power is available. It also comes with its own USB cable and travel pouch.<br /><br />The above qualities are certainly good, but what matters most is the charging ability. I have a Samsung smartphone and, putting this charger to the test, I found that the charge ratio is about 3 to 1. What I mean is that my smartphone could be charged up to 30 percent using only 10 percent of the available charge on this SAFUEL Portable Charger. That means if the SAFUEL is 100 percent charged, I could charge my smartphone completely, three times, and still have power to spare.<br /><br />And this charger gets the job done in a relatively short time. With each passing minute, my smartphone gained two percentage points of charge. So, at that rate, my smartphone would be charged completely in about 50 minutes. Excellent numbers, especially compared to other portable chargers I have used.<br /><br />We need electronics and we need to make sure they remained powered throughout the day, wherever we go.  With this SAFUEL Portable Charger, I have the extra juice available when I need it and I can continue about my day without worry. It’s one of the best I have ever used and one I recommend.",1649357321433,1,False
5.0,Holds Your Phone Firmly in Place,"Cell phones are great for many reasons and while we know we shouldn’t use them while we drive, sometimes, we must do this, like when opening up a map and trying to follow it. To be safe, a phone mount is essential, and a good choice is this cell phone mount, made by Tronwin.<br /><br />My greatest problem with cell phone mounts is that they tend to not hold themselves in place. This is my number one demand when I purchase a cell phone mount for a car: It must be the type that clips on or otherwise grips in a way that it won’t fall off. Mounts that use suction cups are the worst. Clip on are best and this mount scores highly in this area. It clips to the air vent, and it holds firmly in place.<br /><br />This cell phone mount can hold just about any cell phone, regardless of its size. You just push the button to move the sides out, place your phone between, and the squeeze together. To release your phone, just push the button in the back once again. You can pull the base down, too, if necessary to make your phone fit.<br /><br />Another cool thing about this cell phone mount is that it can be moved around most any way you like. Other mounts will come loose if you try to move them too much. But with this mount, it can be moved to just the right angle. You can even turn it sideways, if you prefer to view your cell phone that way.<br /><br />Cell phones are a regular part of life. This cell phone mount from Tronwin is an excellent choice for all the reasons stated above. It stays secure and offers extra movement not possible with other mounts.",1641141564694,1,False
4.0,Pair of Cords for Peace of Mind,"We all know the importance of keeping our electronics charged and ready for use. It’s a good idea to have spare charge cords for this purpose, since you never know when the need for additional power will be needed. A good option is this iPhone Charger Fast Charging Data Sync Transfer Cord with USB Wall Charger Travel Plug, made by Belcompany.<br /><br />With this charger, you get a pair of cords/plugs. This is nice, because you instantly have a spare that you can take with you to work, leave in your car, etc. Charging cords are easy to lose so it’s nice to have a pair of them.<br /><br />This charging cord will juice up an iPhone from near zero to one hundred percent in about 40 minutes. That means, with each 2- 3 minute period of charge, your phone will gain one percent. This is good speed and I like that the cord is over three feet in length. It is long enough that you can plug it into a nearby outlet and still be able to hold and use your phone.<br /><br />Keeping cell phones charged and ready to go is important. This package pair of charging cords from Belcompany is a good one overall. It gets phones charged in reasonable time and its practical design makes it useful for everyday needs.",1626977484256,0,False
4.0,Storage for Your Phone and More,"When you exercise, you need a place to store things. Preferably, the storage is in a place where it won’t interfere with your workout and be too noticeable as you move around. I’m normally fine with putting things in my pocket while I walk, but if I’m jogging, cycling, etc it can get uncomfortable. A good alternative to shorts pockets is this Cell Phone Armband with Airpods Bag Running Armband from Haissky<br /><br />To use this, you just wrap it around your arm and hold in place with the Velcro. If your arm is smaller than average, you can adjust it to fit. The emphasis seems to be on using this for iphones, but it can be used with other smartphones also.<br /><br />The best thing about this armband is that it is slick to the touch and moisture repellant, so it keeps you feeling cool. And with it on your arm, it doesn’t restrict movement. It’s also nice that it has a separate pocket to hold your keys, spare change, and so on, plus a slot for cards. Bear in mind, however, that the pocket isn’t that big- it’s too small to hold a full wallet, for example. But you can easily fit your credit card and a little bit of cash or coin in the pocket, so that should be sufficient.<br /><br />With the preponderance of electronics, we need to have a place to store them. This armband is a good item for this purpose. It keeps your cellphone up and out of the way when you exercise and it’s comfortable to wear. I still try to use my regular pockets when I can, but this armband does provide a useful alternative.",1606931202126,0,False
4.0,Charge Up to Four Items as Once,"We all know the importance of keeping our electronics charged and ready for use. Electronics are a fact of life and it is important that we keep enough charge to make sure they don’t run out of juice when we need them most. An easy way to keep electronics charged is through a wireless charging station, like this OCOMMO 4 in 1 Wireless Charging Pad.<br /><br />I have another wireless charging station, but mine is only good for one phone at a time and nothing more. With this charging station, you have space for two cell phones plus UBS ports where you can plug in and charge up to two more devices. This means the station can charge up to four items at once, which is great for those who have a lot of different electronics. Also, not every electronic is capable of wireless charging, but with the two USB, this isn’t a problem, since you can plug the other items in, as needed.<br /><br />My kids have more than just cell phones, so I know that they can use a device like this. My older daughter loves this- she can charge her phone wirelessly, next to her bed, and easily reach for it and remove it from the stand as needed, without having to mess with a cord. The wireless action charges just as quickly as using a cord- she told me there is no difference. Again, the advantage with this charging station is that you can charge four items at the same time. And since it is flat in design, it is easy to take anywhere with you.<br /><br />Electronics need constant charging and this OCOMMO 4 in 1 Charging Pad is an efficient way to keep your electronics juiced up and ready to go. It’s an item that makes a great gift for the teen or adult who owns multiple electronics.",1606845425096,0,False
5.0,Keeps the Family Electronics Charged and Ready for Use,"Electronics lose their charge quickly on long road trips. My kids need to keep themselves occupied and a charger is therefore important. Our solution is the Cluvox USB C Car Charger.<br /><br />This charger is small, lightweight, and plugs into your car’s charging port with ease. It has two ports: QC3.0 port to deliver fast charging and a regular USB-A port that works for most electronics. It’s very useful if you have any Apple electronics. One of my kids as an Apple iPhone, so she likes having a quick means to charge her phone.<br /><br />This charger is small- less than 2 inches in length. That makes it good for carrying it with you, as it fits easily in your pocket. I like that it glows in blue when operational. This is a simple way to know that the charger is ready to go.<br /><br />We use electronics every time we are in our car or truck. Smartphones, iPhones, and tablets are a regular way of life and we need to keep them charged. Cluvox USB C Car Charger is an efficient means to a happy, well- charged family and a charger that works well for most all uses.",1596390466318,0,False
4.0,Keeps Your Phone Safely in Place,"Navigating from place to place is now easier than ever before thanks to the internet and the many mapping functions that exist. It’s so easy to enter a destination and have the route laid out before you, complete with directions, but it’s not always easy to see your phone, since it usually involves looking down. A positive solution to this problem is the DM Cell Phone Holder for Car.<br /><br />This cell phone holder mounts to your vehicle vents and is secured with a clip. The ball- like twist lock makes it easily movable so that you can adjust it in different directions for the best viewing angle.<br /><br />DM Cell Phone holder is the third such cell phone holder I have owned and it ranks as a good one overall. For me, the definitive qualities of a good cell phone holder are its ability to stay secure and its ability to easily release your phone when you’re finished using it. With the security, this one is pretty good. I was fortunate because  the clip barely fit around the flaps of the vents in my truck. If the thickness had been any greater, it wouldn’t have worked.<br /><br />With the release, this one is good, but it took time to get used to. With my other cell phone holders, the release was achieved by pushing a button on the back. With this holder, you have to grip the bottom prong and pull it downward to release. Not knowing this at first, I got frustrated and pulled it off the air vent completely before being able to remove. Now that I understand better how it works, everything is fine.<br /><br />This holder is designed for thin phones and its triangular orientation is made to hold your phone vertically. I like what I have experienced with this holder so far and I recommend it for those who, like me, prefer to see directions on their cell phone screen while they drive and prefer the safety of keeping their phone closer to windshield level for viewing.",1581295764557,1,False
5.0,Practical Charging Device for Vehicles,"Charging one’s electronics is an ongoing need. This sounds simple enough, but when you’re driving and several family members all start clamoring about the need for more percentage points on their cell phone charge gauge, you could have a real problem. The solution?- a multiple port charging system like the Wishinkle 5 Ports Multi Passenger Car Charger.<br /><br />This car charger is designed to charge several devices from a single cord. You plug it into your car’s socket, and then plug your electronics cords into any one of the 5 ports. The ports are identical, with the exception of the electrical capabilities: 2.4 amps for the two front ports, 2 amps for the three back ports. Just plug in the cord and let the charging begin.<br /><br />The cord for this charger is about 5 feet in length and easily its best quality is the fact that it has ports on both ends. Most multi- port chargers have the ports in one place, right next to where you plug the cord into your car socket. This can make it a challenge sometimes to stretch cords from the back seat to the front, and it can make it difficult for the backseat passengers to continue to use their devices while the charging is taking place because the backseat passengers may not be able to reach. These problems are solved with the Wishinkle charger. The backseat passengers have three ports right there, nearby. They can charge and still use their device with no problem.<br /><br />We use this cord in our SUV and it has made our lives much better. The back part of the cord has a clip and we just attach it to the pocket on the backside of either of our front seats. With this type of arrangement, we just leave the cord permanently plugged in and clipped to the back of the seat. Now, anytime someone needs a charge, they can easily take care of things. They don’t have to say a word.<br /><br />Electronics are here to stay and the need to keep our electronics charged and ready to go is a constant need. The Wishinkle 5 Ports Multi Passenger Car Charger is the solution to our family charging needs and it’s a practical device we are thrilled to have.",1570048742129,1,False
4.0,"Provides the Power You Need, When You Need It","With electronics in most everyone’s pocket or purse at any given time, it is important that we keep them charged and ready for use. I spend a good deal of time in my car and occasionally, I need an added boost for my cell phone, just to be safe. Therefore, a car charger is an important accessory and a good option for this everyday need is AmazonBasics Car charger 15 watt USB- C Port, 12 watt USB- A Port.<br /><br />This car charger has two different ports and that means you can charge two different electronics at the same time. The ports are USB-C and USB-A, so they are different in size and thus can accommodate different electronics. It is important to make sure this fits your needs before you make a purchase. If your electronics require the same size port, then you won’t be able to charge more than one item at a time.<br /><br />With this charger, you just plug it into your car’s cigarette lighter. You will see a small blue light to indicate that the charger is delivering the juice and is ready for use. It charges at a fast rate. From my experience, with my Samsung cell phone, I have found that this device charges at a rate of about 2 percent each minute. So, doing the math, that means it will charge a completely dead phone all the way to the 100 percent level in about 50 minutes. This is fast enough to easily suit my car charging needs.<br /><br />AmazonBasics makes many reliable products and I have had good experiences with all of them thus far. The AmazonBasics Car charger 15 watt USB- C Port, 12 watt USB- A Port gets the job done and can charge two different electronics at once. It is convenient and delivers the extra power you need, when you need it.",1561477398506,1,False
4.0,Keeps Your Phone Securely in Place,"With as much time as I spend driving and as much as I use my cell phone’s navigation system, it is imperative that I have some way to keep my cell phone safely visible. A cell phone holder is the obvious solution to the concern and a very good choice is the Baseus Car Vent Cell Phone Holder.<br /><br />My first experience with a cell phone holder was one of the types that attaches itself to the dash. These phone holders rely on suction cups and/or adhesive to stay in place and my experience with them has been negative overall mainly because they tend to loosen up and fall over, often with minimal touching or pressure. I knew that a car vent style holder was better and that is what convinced me to get this device from Baseus.<br /><br />This cell phone holder clips to your car vent and it comes with two different clipping attachments. One of them has legs, the other does not. I found that the one with legs takes more effort to attach and it appears that this is due to the fact that the round ball is a little larger with the one with legs, making it more difficult to screw the nut into place. The other attachment, without the legs, attaches more securely.<br /><br />With its flat backing, this cell phone holder helps protect against excessive hot or cold air coming from your car vent and affecting your cell phone. This was a concern of mine, because I know that when my cell phone overheats, it loses power quickly. The backing on this holder provides a barrier and keeps your phone from getting hit directly by the air coming from the vent.<br /><br />This holder remains secure while I drive and it hasn’t popped loose even once. I like that there is sufficient room to plug in my cord without any interference and I like that I can reach for my phone, touch the screen, and press buttons without worry. To remove your phone from the holder, all you have to do is press the release button. Functionally, it works well and you can even turn your phone sideways if you like without any problem, thanks to the design.<br /><br />Car vent mounted cell phone holders are the way to go and this model from Baseus is a very good one for those of us who use our phone frequently for navigation. I did have the one issue with the attachment with legs not fitting very well, but the other attachment works just fine and it keeps my phone securely in place while I drive. It’s a good cell phone holder for the money and I continue to use it each day.",1554695848848,0,False
5.0,Power Bank Packs the Power!,"Most every person in the modern world has a cell phone and if your cell phone gets a workout due to the demands of your job or some other reason, then regular charging is a must. But what if you are not close to a power source and your phone is almost completely drained? It is these times that a portable charger is needed and an excellent choice for the task is the Power Bank Portable Charger.<br /><br />Flat and slim in design like a cell phone itself, this charger is ready to accommodate. It has two input ports: A micro USB and a Type C port, which are used for charging the charger itself with the short, included cord. It has two output ports so it is possible that you can charge two items at the same time. I use an android phone and to charge my phone, I plug into one of these two, larger output ports and then plug my regular charger cord into the bottom of my android phone, using my own charging cord.<br /><br />Power Bank Portable Charger is far superior to other, similar charging devices I have used and the reason is the amount of power this baby holds! I love that this charger shows you the percentage of power remaining, taking away the guesswork, and I love how long it lasts and how much can be charged. Showing the percentage of power remaining is a great thing to know and it makes me wonder why other manufacturers of similar devices have not yet done something like this. It’s about time that manufacturers have added this crucial piece of information to their technology.<br /><br /> Anyway, let’s go back to the charging ability because this is the device’s strongest point. I tested it using my own android phone and I found that the charging ratio is about 3.5 to one. What this means is that, for each 1 percent of charge that goes away from the charger, my phone’s charging percentage increases by 3.5 percent. Or, to put it in simpler terms, if my phone was completely dead and this charger was at 100 percent, I could plug it in and once my phone was completely charged, this charger would still have about 70 percent of its charge remaining! That means you could charge three phones completely, using this charger, and still have charge left to use for another phone. This is vastly superior to other portable chargers I have used over the years. I also found that, using this charger, my phone will increase its percentage of charge at the rate of just over one percentage each minute. So, I can go from zero to, say, 20 percent charged in about 17 minutes, which is a faster pace than other chargers I have used.<br /><br />This charger packs a lot of juice and it’s long lasting, but to reach 100 percent charge on the charger itself, I have found that it does take many hours. Remember- this charger has a larger amount of storage than others, so it should be expected that it would take a long time.  I haven’t tried plugging it into my computer to charge it- I have only plugged it into the wall, inserting the large end of the included, short cord into the head of my existing cell phone charge cord. Thus, I cannot speak for how fast it would charge if I did it using a computer, but I assume it would be about the same. So, if you know you’re going to need this charger and you plan to use it all day, possibly even allowing others to share it and charge their phone, too, you need to start charging the charging many hours before you need it. On the other hand, if you are the only person who plans to use it, then you don’t need to worry. Like I said, based on my tests with my own phone, I would need the charger to be only about 30 percent charged in order to charge my phone completely, from zero to 100 percent. Oh, and whatever you do, make sure to test everything first to make sure the cords fit properly. I found that the included, short cord is fine for charging this charger, but I cannot use it to charge my own phone because the small end of the included cord will not fit into the base of my phone. Thus, I need to take my own, longer charging cord along wherever I go, plugging one end into my phone and the larger USB end into the charger.<br /><br />When you use your cell phone for work, you could use up power quickly and a portable charger is a must. The Power Bank Portable Charger is the best one I have used so far. It has the ability pack the juice, giving you peace of mind and completely assurance that it will be able to charge your cell phone when you need it. Add to that the digital readout that shows how much power remains and you have everything you need for a successful day of cell phone usage.",1554047264273,8,False

The guy I bought it from had a magnet mount holder for his phone that was mounded to the dash and he used the something old school for the music from his phone. So I bought something else and his phone was smaller and the magnet wouldn’t hold my 7+ so I bought a Humixx ring holder for my case and this mount. Well I so wanted this mount to work as I don’t care for the vent ones and my car vents are elongated and we live in FL, air is not something you want to block. So I used wipes they sent and followed the directions and the first one lasted 3 days. So started over and the second in didn’t last a day.<br /><br />However, I wrote to the company and told them my dilemma and even though I didn’t want the vent clip, I agreed to try it. They sent it to me free and were great about responding and making things right. I will say their magnets I found to be the strongest.

Dirt gets between the phone and the case all the time, and I mean all the time. This makes it look bad but more importantly has the potential to scratch the phone if not cleaned regularly.<br />The case also gets scratched very easily but I guess that's somewhat expected from a clear plastic case.<br />My biggest problem is with the buttons on the side of the phone. The case I received is not like the ones in the product picture. The area where the mute and volume buttons are is not open like the top and the bottom of the phone. Instead, case has tiny openings just for the buttons. This makes it almost impossible to use the buttons unless you use your nails. Using the mute switch is even harder. If you use these buttons on a regular basis then don't buy this case otherwise it will drive you crazy.<br /><br />**update**<br />After my review, the seller send me what they called an ""updated"" version for free.

I would buy again and do recommend.",1650022593036,0,True
4.0,Good durability,It fits perfectly on the back of my phone and holds 3 cards securely.  The elastic hand band was good for my size hands but probably would not be as comfortable for large hands.  I have had it for a couple of months now and use it almost daily.  It has held up quite well.  I would buy another if I needed.,1551580636002,1,True
5.0,Great alt for metal sensitivity people.,I have metal sensitivities. Everything I’ve used previously have given me a rash. My sister bought me one of these for Christmas. I love it. Within a week my rash went away. I haven’t had any issues with these. It’s not going to last for ever. I’ve replaced once since my early Xmas gift because it was starting to stretch out and get a little “peely.” Pic attached for reference. I’m guessing it will need to be replaced every 5-6 months. Worth it to me. Might be more/less depending on the person. But I’ve gotten my money’s worth IMO. Would recommend/buy again.,1619981360316,1,True

I have tried other vent mounts, cup mounts, dash mounts, you name it and all were just junk in the end. This one is so fabulous AND it fits my fat Otterbox Defender case + a phone ring with no issues! NO other phone holder has done that! Not one. This one has an excellent extra clip into the vent, makes a huge difference. The height keeps your head up, not looking down like cup mounts, and this clip comes up to the middle of the phone keeping the vent free.

What fool thought we needed round phone edges in a square world is beyond me, but no matter which screen protector I try, no matter how carefully I follow installation instructions, the second you add the back protection case, the screen protector bubbles or pushes up at edges. This one is no exception. It is NOT cover friendly. That is a trick to suck you in.  Sorry but I think I have now bought every single one sold on Amazon. I do blame Samsung!

This device simply helps you find them later. I'm sure it's great for some things, but none of the tracking devices really does what I want. I want to know the minute I have left something behind.

I could not get tempered glass to sit down evenly on this phone. I tired to install this product and even after using a blow dry to shape and install, it remained bubbled. No thanks. The IQ Shield was finicky, but I have manged to install it. Interestingly enough, my phone immediately left me a message that it sensed moisture. Great. I assume nothing is wrong with the phone, it is supposed to accept a certain amount of water exposure.

2.0,"Sorry, not a choice for Galaxy S8","I don't like to leave poor feedback but I just bought the Samsung S8 and this screen protector.

Then when I tried to add the back protective case for the phone, it made it even worse. It sat up higher rendering it useless. This is a very good idea, but needs some work.

I honestly have a crappy case that’s pretty but not functional lol I saw the “cracks” and I though well there goes my new phone. NOPE I took off the screen protector to see the true damage and there was NOTHING. So many cracks on the protector and nothing on my screen. I am so thankful I have these!!!!",1667766463684,1,True

3.0,I did come with a great screen protector sheet that I was not expecting and ...,I no longer use this case because it broke about two months into use. That being said for the price I paid it makes sense. I did come with a great screen protector sheet that I was not expecting and the color was just bright and beautiful. I just tend to be a bit rough with phone cases and this one did not survive me.,1468245444000,1,True
4.0,I enjoy this case a lot,I enjoy this case a lot. I thought it was going to be a bit harder but its more flexible actually. My main concern has always been 'If I drop my phone will I destroy it?' because I am not graceful in any way. The answer is yes the phone will survive! It also has a nice slightly raised edge for the screen side so you don't have to wonder if when you do drop it and it lands on the screen if you are screwed. Over all I'm very happy. I gave it four stars though because I wish it was a bit harder but for this price it is a very good purchase. The color reminds me of more of a plum too.,1468243613000,0,True

4.0,Good enough for DIY repairs or a backup kit,"While the kit is useful, I wish I hadn't bought it.  I ended up buying other iPhone parts and it was difficult buying spare parts that didn't come with the exact same kit as this.  So no I have 3+ kits, all identical.<br /><br />If you do need to buy a kit though, this one seems as good as any (for the cheap-range that is).<br /><br />I do wish there were instructions included however..some of the pieces I have no idea what to use them for.",1436917127000,0,True

1.0,"DOA - Didn't know, now my phone worse than before","Was DOA (but I had no way of knowing)...and because of this, I ended up doing a ton more damage to my phone.<br /><br />Instead of a simple White Line issue w/my screen...now I have a dead phone (just a single light up top).  My phone has been out of commission for 3 weeks now while I wait for the repair shop to find a way to fix it (I gave up on fixing myself after all this).  I wish I could get TechOrbits to pay my final repair bill...since I had to assume this replacement screen worked...but I doubt I could be so lucky.",1436911805000,0,True
2.0,Good while it lasts,"After dropping my phone from a mere 2 feet for the second time, I now have 2 missing lower corners.  The harder shell becomes brittle over time, which makes it easily chip off chunks of material.  The design is a two-piece system with two types of material, a grippy plastic shell, and a rubbery liner that fits into the shell.  The rubber part is great, but isn't the concern, it's the hard liner that has lost 1&#34; of material on both edges that has me concerned.<br /><br />Right now I'm shopping for another case, and I don't think I'll get another Incipio if I can expect this in the future.<br /><br />I don't drop my phone very often, so in case you're wondering this case survived for about 9 months before it started losing the corners.  Not bad for the $15 I paid Nov '12...but I'd still rather have something that lasts the life of the phone to keep it protected...especially after shelling out this much money for a phone!<br /><br />If you rarely drop your phone, this is still very good for the money.  I haven't tried others yet so I cannot advise on one vs. another.  But if you drop your phone regularly (not me), then I cannot recommend this case.  One of the good merits to this case though is that it does adequately protect the front/screen...some cases are so slim (e.g. Ringke Slim), that if you drop it flat on the screen you're rolling the dice.  This one has gotten me through 2 minor drops (that I can remember)...but now the case is useless.  Good luck.",1381772106000,0,True

The pocket has a snap, meaning my cards, cash whatever are secured inside (a different ring/pocket case I had got soo loose that when one card was removed, everything would fall out - disastrous).<br />4. The pocket adheres very nicely to the phone - no peeling as of yet.<br />5. The material is very durable - so it feels like it will last.<br /><br />Considerations (not really Cons, but definitely FYI)<br />1. This adds some bulk to the phone in terms of weight and size.<br />2. The pockets don't really expand or shrink. The snap means items won't fall out, but you can not fit an infinite amount in here. I have 3 cards and 2 bills (money) folded inside and I have probably room for 2 more cards (I checked - but it's tight). 5 cards (no money) is the max comfort fit.

I will probably only keep it for a month or two before I get sick of it. I just hate the sticky plastic feel and the smudgy fingeprints on the back. And good luck trying to get this on and off the phone. I feel like I'm going to break the corners of my phone every time I try to take it off.

It does't sit flush against the phone some parts press up against the phone more than others making the back look dirty when its not<br />-Gets dirty easily: fingerprints, scratches, etc.<br /><br />In my opinion, not worth the price tag.

3.0,Great with few problems,"The installation was not that hard just follow directions EXACTLY! If I were to do it all over again, I would spray more than my finger tips OR I would spray the screen protector holding it in the air and not resting it in the palm of my hand. I may also not go so crazy with the water, think it was a little too wet and made the installation messy and caused me to have a lot of bubbles.<br /><br />GIVE IT TIME AND BE PATIENT! The bubbles, scratches, imperfections will go away after 12 hours! It is crystal clear and makes the screen look great. However there are slight ridges on the screen when held up against the light (with the screen off), which I think is normal, but I wish it looked a little smoother.<br /><br />DOWNSIDE: When I took it out of the box, it had 2 particles stuck to it by the speaker cut-out. They are still there can I cant get them off, hopefully hasn't scratched my screen. I contacted them for a replacement and they were very helpful.<br /><br />I used to have the Zagg invisible shield on a previous phone and they actually look/feel identical, in my opinion.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/2011 - I tried to get a replacement and it costs $4.95 for ""shipping and handling.

5.0,Still cold hours later,"I was not sure if I would like this tumbler because I have always used the acrylic decorative tumblers.  But I recently started drinking protein smoothies or shakes in the morning, and I needed something that would keep the frozen texture for at least a couple of hours.  After only one day of using this product, I can already say I am very happy I made the switch.  I blended my frozen smoothie and poured it into this tumbler at 7 a.m.  When I finally got around to finishing the smoothie at 11 a.m., it was still frozen (I kept finding bits of ice!).  I rinsed it out and put water in at noon, and there was no lingering flavor issue.  The outside of the cup feels cool whenever I have a drink in it, but that does not bother me.  The only negative I've noticed so far is that I cannot use the straw for the smoothie, but the sip style lid works great for that use.  Overall, I would definitely buy this product again.<br /><br />Update (7/15/16): I tried using crushed ice in my water yesterday, but I noticed it melted within a couple of hours.  And I was inside an air conditioned building at the time.  Ice cubes have lasted a few hours longer, but they still melt pretty quickly.  The good news is even if the ice melts I've noticed my water will stay cold enough for me to keep using the cup.  If you are expecting ice to stay in solid form for a full 24 hours, this cup may not be the best option.  On average, I would say the ice does not stay in solid form for more than six hours or so.",1468350914000,4,True

I can see Edge type signal interminttenly but this device couldn't boost that as well. I think if I attached the antanea near a window that overlooks the outside and ran a very long cable (200+ feet), then this might have worked.<br /><br />Problem was actually solved by my provider T-Mobile. They sent me a wireless signal booster called Personal Cellspot for free and that worked perfectly. I first became aware of this when I called my provider to register the product. Two things that were of concern was that 1. this device is made in China. And after the governments warning about Huawei and anything internet related made in China, I was very concerned. 2. Also, FCC requires all devices such as these to be registered because it intercepts and boosts available signals.<br /><br />So I was happy that T-Mobile has it's own solution and the device they sent me is already pre-registered (and hopefully tested for protection).",1562610740659,1,True

We'll take off the fee for it also. Just make sure you return it if you ever want to cancel with T-Mobile"". And then they sent it over next day via FedEx. I hooked it up and now I have signal.<br /><br />Bit about my situaiton. My new office is on the first floor of a bank. This used to be where they processed mortgage checks so the walls are very thick and reinforced. SO there is literally NO SIGNAL in the entire space. There are some spotty Edge signals. I was having a heck of a time trying to connect to anything. So once I got the units, I put the Window Unit (WU) next to a window facing outside. Got about three bars. Then I put the Coverage Unit (CU) right on my desk in the office. My office is about 100 ft away from the window. And I got SIGNAL! it was really painless.

5.0,Samsung Galaxy Note 2 Screen Protectors - NEW 2013 Ultra Premium HD Version {1 pack of 3 from iSmooth},"I was in need of a cell phone replacement and once I made up my mind which one it would be I began my search for accessories which is a prerequisite for the phone purchase. Gotta check out the accessories available before I get the phone. Well this was one of the 2 screen protector brands I tried and I absolutely will be buying these again. I have never had such a bubble free application of a screen protector before in my considerable experience with cell phones over the years. The iSmooth company is putting out not just a superior product but great customer service. I read the inserts and everything inside the package and a good thing I did! I was directed to their website and it had a great video demonstration of how to apply the screen protector! I was so shocked and amazed that a little direction can go a very long way.<br /><br />Thanks iSmooth! You have a new and very happy customer with your product, the packaging, everything that is included with the screen protectors and some truly awesome customer service. You don't just get a tiny dust cloth with these screen protectors you get a full size cloth. Okay, I didn't measure it, but it was the same size if not larger than my new cell phone which has a 5.5&#34; screen. It has a thank you card! Can you believe it. It also has some little stickies that you can use to get dust from between the screen and screen protector if you find any there after the installation.<br /><br />I think many people feel that the directions should be enough to apply something as simple as screen protectors and for many that may be the case, but I am just telling you that it made a huge difference in my experience to have the video and not just the directions, which are also included on a card insert with the product.<br /><br />So last but not least, they offer assistance while you are on the website if you desire it. Now this is something truly great in my opinion. Live help online while you shop or watch a product video. I am very happy I made this choice and I don't feel like I need to look for anything better.

At the time I bought the tablet there were very few covers available. I bought another model from this same company. It was horrible and I returned it. This became available and I jumped at the chance. The biggest issue is the weight, this is over 8 ounces, half the weight of the tablet. It really bulks  up your lightweight table badly and that's disappointing. But it does a decent job of protecting the tablet. The case has magnets which turn the tablet on and off as you open it. Problem there is the way the case configures it covers the rear camera port so they put in a creased corner you can flop down and use the camera with the cover back. This corner also has magnets in it. They should have been left out of this section because it's so floppy it won't stay closed so it's constantly turning the table on and off as the case gets moved around. This is truly annoying though far less annoying than the cover I returned. I'm not 100% happy with this but it was necessary because the tablet was too slippery without a case.

I put the package aside intending to return it (I didn't bother checking the 2nd unit, I didn't pay for 50% of my purchase to be useless). Fully my fault but at that time I had health issues as did my mother whom I take care of. Arranging the return of nine dollars worth of junk glass just didn't make my priority list and I ran out of time and the return window closed. I may have exchanged them, probably not though. Currently I'm going with an Otterbox Symmetry case and no screen protector after watching several tech related YouTube channels. I don't recommend this product. I can't speak on the adhesive quality but half of what I bought was visibly defective. The market for these things is a quagmire of scams and reviews culled from entirely different products.

2.0,Seriously Disappointing Case,"I've had several cases for my Galaxy S9 and this one disappointed me the most. I was using (and have gone back to) an Otterbox Symmetry case. I found my ports were getting some pocket lint in them, saw the Commuter case on a Gold Box special and jumped at the opportunity. Ten minutes on my phone was enough to decide, this is going back.<br />The inner lining is very soft and flimsy feeling. It didn't feel durable or protective. The outer hard-shell cover is thin, cheap plastic that feels brittle and easy to break. The Symmetry case had an overall texture that gave a positive feel in the hand. The hard parts of the Commuter are slick and slippery. It popped out of my hand just picking it up off the table. The covers for the charging and headphone ports are part of the inner material. Once wiggled free of the hard case they worked reasonably well. The one way in which this case was superior to the Symmetry is the ease of pressing the power button. The case material on the Symmetry is much stiffer which makes for a harder button press or double press to pull up the camera.<br />I honestly feel the Commuter case doesn't come close to the durability of the Symmetry and that it would not provide adequate protection for my phone.",1568224151875,5,True
4.0,Really Good Charger,This Yootech Wireless Charger works flawlessly with my Samsung Galaxy S9 while it has an Otterbox Symmetry case on it. I really like how it lights up briefly to let you know the phone has connected and is charging at high speed then goes dark so if it's in your bedroom it doesn't keep you awake. You can place the phone in either landscape or portrait orientation so it can charge while you use it for whatever you'd like.

The case doesn't even have a lip like most to raise the screen above a surface when placing the phone face down. This is a floppy, easily crumpled piece of TPU. The opening for the camera and fingerprint sensor doesn't afford easy, comfortable access to the sensor. This Kit Me Out cover is also very slippery offering no increase in grip. It actually feels worse than the phone without the cover.<br />Avoid this product.",1566508627208,0,False
5.0,Now This is a Case,"This Otterbox Symmetry case fits my Samsung Galaxy S9 perfectly. All ports are easily accessible. The sides are beefy and have a cut running around the edge that greatly increases grip on the phone. It will eventually collect pocket lint but seems easy to clean.<br />Buttons work perfectly. The opening for the camera, fingerprint reader and sensors is the best of the several cases I've tried. There's a nicely sloped bevel that allows your finger to easily and comfortably access the fingerprint sensor. This opening is one hole unlike many cases that have a piece of case unnecessarily dividing the opening (possibly interfering with the flash function).<br />The case is screen protector friendly coming right up to the edge of most protectors adding a good protective edge around the screen. The top and bottom of the case are raised several millimeters above the screen area keeping above any surface the phone is placed upon.<br />The Otterbox Symmetry is thick enough to inspire confidence in its protection but doesn't add a lot of weight or bulk.<br />The Symmetry case supports fast wireless charging.

This case is screen protector friendly. The dual colors are attractive especially on my blue Galaxy S9.

I tested the PaperWhite with and without this skin in place and there really wasn't that much of a difference with the amount of grip necessary to keep the Kindle from slipping from my hand.<br /><br />So... You have a skin that doesn't protect the part of the Kindle Paperwhite that's most in need of protection, the screen. Doesn't add a lot of protection to the back and sides of the device and isn't that much better for holding the Kindle.<br /><br />About the only good part of this skin is the power button cover of the Skin makes turning the Kindle PaperWhite on and off much easier.

5.0,WOW!!!,"I killed my Huawei Honor 10 phone when I laid it on my scooter seat. The phone slid off and crashed onto the pavement below destroying the screen. Uuuugghhh. I loved that phone. A trusted companion for 2 years.<br />Well, I needed a replacement. My biggest wish was the largest screen for the buck. I wanted something big, fast and compatible for my eyes when mounted on my scooter for GPS and Waze. The size of this phone's screen was perfect. In no way was I going to spend $1000 for a phone. Only morons are stupid enough to do that.<br />The TCL was less than half the cost of my Huawei. I'm glad I took a chance on it. I couldn't believe the enhancements that had occurred over 2 years. The TCL is quick, responsive and has an excellent screen. The fingerprint and facial recognition systems work great and it does everything I want it to do perfectly. Even when I just have 1 or 2 bars showing, voice calls are crisp and clear.<br />I don't do games or social media (more moron territory) so I can't comment on that. But media playback from the Micro sd I installed is fast and immaculate on the screen and built in speakers. What's not to love?

It was a good review but it turns out that this phone is even better than I first thought.<br /><br />I replaced my Huawei Mate SE with this product. The Mate SE is a great phone but I needed a bit more RAM. When I saw the Honor View 10 with 6 GB and 128 GB of storage, I ordered it. I assumed it would be a Mate SE with a bit more kick. Turns out that this phone is way, WAY more :<br /><br />It charges fast. The battery life is incredible. The screen display, colors and resolution are phenomenal. Performance is FAST. The sound quality is a delight to hear. The Music and Video apps bundled with the phone aren't the greatest, but I use VLC and am very happy. How the heck did they get such wondrous and full sound to come out of those itty bitty speakers??? Watching a movie is great!!! I'm not a photographer, but I'm very happy with the photos it takes. This phone is a b@llbuster!<br /><br />By the way, I tried both the Galaxy S9+ and the Huawei Mate 10 Pro. Wound up returning them both. They were okay, but they weren't that great, especially not in their respective price tags great. Unlike the Mate SE where the fingerprint sensor was away from the camera lenses, the S9+ and Mate 10 Pro had it right underneath the lenses. Fumble to touch the sensor and you smear the lenses. Not just dumb but moronic. The Honor View 10's fingerprint sensor is under the screen. Perfect! Now I can use my thumbs.<br /><br />This phone is just plain wonderful. Remember when you were a kid (I'm 60) and got that one toy at Christmas which you played with for more than a day, went back to that same toy over and over again and never got bored with it? This phone is that toy. Enjoy!!!<br /><br />A couple other things. I use this with Tracfone. Absolutely no problems. When I removed the Tracfone SIM from the Mate SE and installed it into this unit, I was instantly up and running.

In my panicked reflex I instantly flung the phone away from me like a frisbee for some crazy stupid reason (something I've never done, even with other bugs flying into my screen in the past), sending it spinning from my hand into the concrete six or so feet away from me.  My heart sank.  What have I done?  And yet, not a scratch on it, not a single blemish. Even the case still looks perfect.<br /><br />That alone, to me, is worth the price.

It will stick, but the slightest jiggle will cause it to fall off. I have to think that if this is being used in a car, there’s going to be more than a slight jiggle from time to time. It works on the phone if it doesn’t have a case on it but who doesn’t have a case for their phone? It works fine for my iPhone 13 Pro with a case on it.

2.0,Very misleading,The video suggests that the guide will help you put it on straight. The guide they give you is a useless piece of plastic that won’t guide anything. You basically have to put these on yourself without any help from a guide. I bought a three pack and didn’t get it right until the third try and even then it’s still a little bit wonky.

1.0,Warning! Slides out of slot!,When you slide this into your watch it slides right back out. I’ve seen a few other reviews that have the same problem.

They provide three extra links to lengthen it but that would only add maybe a half of an inch.

3.0,Really sticky,I don’t want it to sound like I am knocking this product even though it’s not the product I thought it was. I was looking for something that had a little bit of grip so my laptop wouldn’t slide around on a lab table that I have. This thing is straight up sticky. None of the stickiness transferred onto my laptop or my hands but it’s like someone poured honey all over the table and sat my laptop in it. Not exactly what I was looking for but if you’re looking for something that is really really sticky than this is a product for you.,1640644286295,0,True
2.0,The description lies,I have an 8 1/2 inch wrist so seeing that this band was compatible with up to 9 inches was a selling point. After receiving the band it is super tight on the absolute last notch. This band is not for people with big wrists. There’s no way that this could fit on someone who needed a 9 inch band. I would say 7 1/2 max. The only reason I’m not returning it is because it was so cheap to begin with and I like the watch housing that came with it.,1638661760227,0,True
1.0,Way too small and not actually adjustable,"As the title says, this watch really isn’t adjustable. It comes with a bend in it and anything other than that size is cumbersome. Technically it will bend but it sticks out and catches on everything. Plus the tags and flaps stick out a lot more than they do in the picture. The reviews said that this band wasn’t durable but honestly it was so uncomfortable that I never got to that point. The pre-bend in the strap makes it good for maybe a child but anything bigger than that and it’s useless.",1638225468305,0,True
1.0,Absolutely awful. Do not buy under any circumstances.,This is the most confusing Apple Watch screen protector on the market. The video is very convoluted and doesn’t really show you what you need to do. I tried to install all of them and failed each time. I honestly thought that the hard plastic was the protector the first couple of times as I could not believe that somethings so flimsy could be what I was supposed to be installing on the watch. No wonder they give you a bunch in the box because they’re all garbage and not worth a penny.,1620936396635,2,True
2.0,Waaaaaaay too slippery for an iPhone case.,The description says anti-slip technology but this is the slipperiest iPhone case I have ever held. It almost feels greasy. I can’t really speak to its protection qualities because I wouldn’t dare walk around with this case on my phone seeing that I would most likely drop it every time I took it out of my pocket. It would almost be safer to cover my phone in Vaseline as that would be less slippery than this garbage case.,1620849481421,3,True
1.0,Picture is deceiving,This case does not have nearly the amount of grip that the picture would lead you to believe. The honeycomb design is not as raised up as it is in the picture. It’s really more just a design that it is a function. The picture makes it look like it’s a snow tire when in reality it’s basically a smooth piece of plastic with a nano meter honeycomb etched into it. If you’re looking for a case that has a grip this is not the case for you. The back of the case and the sides are very very smooth and slippery.,1610297382486,2,True
5.0,Great for people with big wrists.,I have about a 8.5” wrist so even the larger size of most brands is too small or I end up using the very last hole with makes the end stick out and catch on shirts or jackets. This one is great. Almost too big but you can thread the excess back through the hoops so it’s fine and gives it a cool look.  I bought the olive green but will be purchasing other colors/designs for sure.,1607635411249,0,True
1.0,Does not work with iPhone 11 Pro or iPhone 8,As it says in the title I have the iphone 11 Pro. Not the super sized one but the smaller one with the 3 camera lenses.  I use a very thin and light silicone case and the magnets on this will not hold it.  It slides right off. If you have the iPhone Max I fear it wouldn't slide off it would just fall so be careful if that's the phone you have.  I have an iphone 8 for work that has a similar case and the same thing happens. What good is a phone holder that doesn't hold a phone?  Cheap crap.  DO NOT BUY!,1595016065644,0,True
2.0,Just OK.,"It’s super cheap for a case so I wasn’t expecting much. The green looks good on my green iPhone 11 Pro. It seems very protective and the buttons, although covered by the case, are easy to push. The downside is it’s very slippery. It feels like it makes it more slippery than the glass phone itself. If you are looking for something cheap it’s a good buy but if you’re prone to having your phone slip out of your hand maybe look for something else.",1578605095544,0,True

1.0,Garbage,"Save your money. I ordered these because they were $8 for a 6 pack. They wouldn’t be worth it if they were a penny. They are flimsy plastic, not ridged like the one I had on my last watch. You have to peel it off and there is no way to hold it on the sides because it isn’t hard plastic (It’s basically like Saran Wrap). Because of this there is no way to not get a finger print on the sticky side when you peel it off so even if you do get it on straight there is a smudge in the corner. I should have realized that something made to protect a screen should not come in a six pack. If they give you that many what are they really going to protect if I have to replace it 6 times?",1563830739493,1,True
3.0,Looks great but one flaw.,"Looks great, seems to provide a lot of protection. The only problem is while this was on my phone it made the buttons to release the watch band impossible to push.

5.0,Fits well and sturdy too,Got this for my ultra and it fits just the way I’d like for the most part. My only gripe is sometimes the ultra doesn’t recognize it’s being worn. I think it doesn’t rest perfectly flush on my wrist while wearing this band so it goes into lock mode which requires I key in my password. I like my bracelet watches to move on my wrist just a bit so it’s more comfortable for me. With a smart watch that interferes with its function slightly.

5.0,Slick design sturdy build,Picked this up since I almost never use a case on my phone. I wasn’t disappointed with this one. It isn’t bulky at least not as much as I was expecting. And the sliver buttons give it a really subtle but slick style. The casing itself has a very subtle design on it but it’s not over the top or “tactical”. All in all very good pick up.

4.0,Sleek power bank for your EDC needs,"The Momax powerbank comes in a decent package. It claimes to have a textured woven design. Initially I thought it would be like those pixel cases but it's not like that. It doesn't feel like cloth but rather a bit plastic-y but with a textured finish. Just a minor observation.<br /><br />The powerbank itself is sleek and lightweight. It has 1 USB 2.0 output for your cables with QC 3.0. For input it has 1 usb C and 1 lightning port. Which is great for both android and ios users. It has 10000mah battery which means you can keep it in your backpack and not worry about it for a while. Although it claims to charge 50% in 30mins but it was more like 30% in 30mins (using OnePlus Nord with 30w warp charging capabilities)<br /><br />It has wireless charging capabilities (10w) and it can charge smaller devices with it's low charging option (double click the button). The LED indicators aren't the great. Sometimes it's not clear as light bleeds from one LED to the next.<br /><br />In conclusion this is an excellent powerbank. It is sleek, lightweight and holds enough charge for most of your portable device charging needs<br /><br />Pros -<br />10000mah is more than enough<br />20w fast charging<br />10w wireless charging<br />Low charging mode for earbuds and smaller devices<br />Lightweight and modern<br /><br />Cons -<br />Charging time is average.<br />The battery indicators can be better",1651808766364,0,False

That part off the case tore apart (see photo) which of dropped could compromise the phone in that area. The second flaw is OtterBox's warranty. While the case is under warranty there is a $10 fee for using it to get a replacement case. That seems cheesy and cheap to me by OtterBox.<br /><br />I will not buy another case from OtterBox.,1673154338245,0,False
2.0,This case is superior for protection but horrible for connectivity...,"I had a clear OtterBox case for a few months when the lower left corner tore apart. Even with the warranty OtterBox requires a $10 replacement and $2.99 shipping fee for a replacement case! I decided not to get the replacement that didn't last... That's a bad investment and I should have known better from a previous poor experience with an OtterBox case.<br /><br />I've had Supcase cases in the past and have never had problems with them. They are well made, fit my previous phones great and are military drop graded. This one was priced less than the OtterBox and had better features. It is built better than the OtterBox also- you can use either the front frames with a built-in screen protector or the one without it.<br /><br />The one with the screen protector has a cutout so that the fingerprint reader functions better (the guide asks that you register your fingerprint again after installing the phone in the case). I did and it works great... The screen protector also works fine for swyping.<br /><br />There is a kick stand on the back of the case for hands-free watching the screen in horizontal or vertical mode.<br /><br />Also included a rotating belt clip holster. When everything is attached it's heavy but I am fine with it. It feels secure and I have peace of mind the phone is well protected.<br /><br />I'll update this review in a few months.<br /><br />UPDATE - 01/06/23: Ever since I began using this case I noticed my phone having connectivity issues no matter if I was using WiFi or the T-Mobile network. After all these months thinking the SIM card might need replacing I went to the T-Mobile website for troubleshooting advice.<br /><br />One suggestion worked 100%- remove the case. As soon as I did that the connections were robust. The phone was so much faster now that it could receive a great signal- WiFi or only T-Mobile.<br /><br />As much as I love the case I'll have have to return it.",1665620723862,10,True

4.0,"Silicon case? Break out the Gorilla glue- don't use the screws, it won't work!","I love the MOBI HANDLE however the modifications one must go through if you have a silicon case isn't reasonable- especially if that silicon case is a military grade anti-impact case. The adhesive on the handle won't adhere to silicon cases so if you have one you are instructed to use the screws included in the kit to screw on the handle without using the adhesive pad. This not a good solution because the screws are very tiny, it is nearly impossible to create holes in a silicon case (especially if it is thick) and the included screwdriver is so small you cannot place enough torque on it to drive the screws through the case into the handle. Solution? I used Gorilla Glue to adhere the handle to the case (the case only cost me $12 so I am not overly worried about harming it). Gorilla Glue will stick to anything and it did- success! Great handle however another solution needs to be included with this kit if you have a silicon military grade case.",1610553763936,0,True

The screen cover hasn't reduced the accuracy or sensitivity while swyping and it fits the phone 100%. I love the clear back which shows off the phone's Nebula Blue color quite well. The cover for the USB port is a bit stiff so it can be a bit difficult to keep it open while trying to plug in the USB cable or headphone dongle without 2 hands but that also seems to keep that area very secure when not in use.

It is also a fingerprint/dirt magnet. I've had other BodyGlove products with a built in screen protector and none have performed as poorly as this one has.<br /><br />I am goin to take the advice of another reviewer and push the existing plastic until it pops out of the screen protector holder.

1.0,It WIL NOT protect your phone from drops!,"I bought this case on March 14, 2014 for my Galaxy S4.  I previously had the phone in a Toughsuit yet the rotating clip on the holster was prone to constantly breaking.  The case itself seems great.<br /><br />I have owned a few items from Otterbox and after reading the reviews for the Defender case I figured this was a tough enough case to keep my phone safe.  It looked great, fit the phone perfect and felt great in my hand.  From assemblying the phone into the case I thought I was going to be ok because it felt solid and very protected inside the Defender case.<br /><br />I was 100% wrong.<br /><br />On April 16th I was walking at work when the phone slipped off the holster that was on my hip and stuck the cement floor face first.  I didn’t think much about it because the Otterbox Defender case is advertised as being able to protect from drops.<br /><br />When I picked up my phone and turned it over to look at the face I was aghast.  The Corning Gorilla Glass 3 was shattered into so many pieces I could not see anything on it except distorted rays of light.  I am 6’-1” tall and figured the phone fell from a distance of about 3 feet.<br /><br />The Defender case couldn’t protect the phone from such a short distance?  The phone wasn’t kicked, stepped on nor anything else- it fell to the cement floor face first.  Neither the phone nor the case had any modifications nor defects to either of them (perhaps the holster does- the phone was clipped in securely when I placed it there).<br /><br />I had insurance on the phone so for about 30% of the original price I got my replacement in one shipping day yet I am not sure Otterbox can make such great claims about a case that the phone didn’t survive a 3 foot drop to a cement floor.  I wrote to Otterbox and their response was, of course, they cannot do anything for me.<br /><br />My replacement phone is back in the Toughsuit case which is advertised as “engineered to meet MIL-STD-810G military standards”- I will simply buy another Toughsuit case for the holster and get Bodyglove to send me a replacement holster also.<br /><br />I will never buy anything from Otterbox again.",1397802957000,4,True

Two of those cases have been replaced under warranty when bits of rubber have separated from the shell. This is a good case, but I find it absurdly overpriced. This item is simply not worth $45 to $50. competing cases are not as grippy, but cost $10. You shouldn't pay five times as much for the same amount of protection with a slightly better pattern.

5.0,"The perfect case for Moto Z3: excellent protection, goes on and off easily, superior design and grip","I do not know why case manufacturers don't seem to understand this model of phone (Moto Z3) uses Moto Mods. If you use Mods (which I do, all the time), you have to remove the case to attach them. Getting some cases off and on can be really frustrating--I tried several. If you use Moto Mods (I use multiple Qi charging + extended battery mods), you need a case that goes on and off easily, yet still provides plenty of drop and slip protection.<br /><br />The search is over--this is that case. I tried other, less expensive cases, and some were far too rigid to go on and off easily, and others too hard or slippery (lacking grip). Getting the more rigid ones on was a lot of work, and taking some of them off was almost impossible. The Speck case pops off and on easily, and their unique interior material provides plenty of shock absorption inside the hard outer shell. Yes, this is essentially a two-layer case in a single piece. This is BRILLIANT. The protection of a dual-layer case (hard outer shell with soft inner layer) without the hassle and time-consuming process of removing and reinstalling a two-piece case daily. Yes, it costs more, but it's worth it. My previous phone (Moto Z Force Droid) had a Speck case, and I am looking forward to years of use from this one.<br /><br />One of my favorite features of this case are the raised rubber lines on exterior. These wrap around the sides of the case, and provide lots of grip and extra cushioning. These lines/ridges act like treads on a tire or an athletic shoe, providing traction on whatever surface you place the phone. The phone is far less likely to slip off the arm of the couch, (example) than it would be in most other cases. Another thing I really appreciate is the way the opening for the fingerprint sensor on the side is perfectly located and designed. Unlike other cases I tried, this case has a beveled opening, with very easy access to the sensor. With other cases, you have to stick your fingertip into a hole to access the sensor--not the case here. It is very well-designed. Look at the pictures of the opening on this case and others--this is the best design I've seen yet.<br /><br />So, $10 for a cheap case which is a hassle to put on and take off, and may not provide adequate protection (the last one I tried was terrible), or $30 for a high quality case which gets the job done properly and feels great in your hand, with plenty of protection and grip?

1.0,Who designed this? I returned it.,"The listing name for this case includes the term, ""Shock-Absorption Armor"". Sorry, but nope. This case is made from rigid plastic which is too hard to provide much in the way of drop protection. Have you ever dropped your phone getting out of the car? I have, and the thought of dropping it in this case is terrifying. I returned it and purchased (yet another) Speck Presidio Grip case (3x the price), and my new phone is now protected properly in a one-piece case with a soft interior and a hard outer shell with rubber grip and corner bumpers. Most of the cases which meet this description are two separate pieces, and the Speck seems to be the only quality case which isn't (I have also tried Trident in the past, but the rubber in their case fell apart). A one-piece case is MUCH easier is you are taking it on and off all the time (see below).<br /><br />Also, it should be noted that due to the hard material this case is constructed from, it is not flexible, and getting it off the phone is a nightmare. I do not know why case manufacturers don't seem to understand this model of phone (Z3) uses Moto Mods. If you use Mods (which I do, all the time), you have to remove the case to attach them. Getting this case off is hard and it even feels a bit like the phone is in danger of bending in the process (scary!). This is just not a well-designed product, and it is not appropriate for either drop protection or daily use with this phone if you use Moto Mods (I use multiple Qi charging + extended battery mods).<br /><br />Also, this case provides no grip assistance and is actually quite slippery, as it is made from hard plastic. I simply cannot recommend this case. I returned it.",1544730355423,4,True
5.0,This is the best Qi charger I have found yet,"I have tried several, and this is the first one that doesn't heat up like mad. My phone will heat up--this is unavoidable, but this charger's design dissipates heat very well, and uses tech to dial it back when it gets too hot. Also, true to the promises made in the product description, it seems to charge my phone (or extra MotoMod battery) faster than any of the several other Qi chargers I have used. Not like 3x faster or anything, but about 1.5x the speed of other Qi chargers--with the same power rating! Amazing. Bonus: it is also a night light, lighting up the room quite a bit with the blue light, which is more powerful/brighter than on any other Qi charger I have used. Note however, it flashes/pulses at times when charging, so this might drive you nuts if it were in your bedroom in the dark at night. I liked it so much I bought another.",1536077656335,0,True
1.0,"Not a good watch. Band broke & watch will not connect to phone after 5 months, 30 day warranty?!","Updated review:<br /><br />After 5 months of use, the watch has completely lost the ability to connect via Bluetooth. I have tried everything to solve this, including a reset (I even got a new phone), and nothing helps. This is just a useless, unconnected digital watch now. Let's do the math: the watch strap broke the day I got it, and had to be replaced ($10). 5 months later, the watch is useless. The seller will not accept a return or exchange. Definitely NOT recommended. I suggest you keep shopping for something better (from a seller with a better return policy/warranty).<br /><br />From the seller: ""Unfortunately we only offer a 30 day warranty period for these units.""<br /><br />--Very disappointed.<br /><br />----<br />Previous review:<br />Not as fast as newer models, but decent, and certainly a decent value at this price ($83). Missing the NFC though--would be nice to use Android pay with my watch, instead of my phone. Also, no heart rate sensor, but it is water-resistant. I like the slim form factor--this is a good looking watch. The leather strap broke almost immediately and I replaced it with a metal one for $10.",1529960487809,0,True
1.0,Does not stay connected to the phone *UPDATED - discontinued by Incipio due to this problem,"This battery pack fits my needs--when it works. It has a LOT of trouble staying connected to the phone. Unlike the Tumi unit it replaced (which stopped holding a charge effectively after 18 months), this one is very finicky about positioning. It must be aligned exactly right, or the battery will not connect with the phone. Once you do manage to get it aligned correctly (takes me &gt; a dozen attempts at times), you cannot touch it. Even just picking it up or slipping it into your pocket will cause the connection to break and it will stop charging. This was never a problem with the first one I had (Tumi--the same unit with a different skin, far more &quot;slippery&quot;). This moto mod arrived ever-so-slightly warped (curved/arced in the middle a tiny bit), and initially did not want to connect at all. Motorola offered to replace it, but as the unit had stopped displaying the behavior by the time I received their email reply, I decided to wait and not return it if I didn't need to--I was going to give it a chance to work. My mistake. The return window has now closed, and the device works properly less than half the time. I filed a warranty claim with Incipio, who has informed me they are no longer carrying this product (due to this issue--apparently this is a common problem). I'm sunk. I cannot recommend this product. Caveat emptor.",1525288618411,1,False
2.0,A $100 battery should give you more than a year and a half of use.,"This battery worked fine for about a year, at which point performance began to decrease. After 18 months it lost the ability to hold a charge. A $100 battery should give you more than a year and a half. Also, be aware this mod is slick on the back and makes your phone VERY slippery while nearly doubling its weight--and it's bulk means you cannot use any sort of protective case while it is installed. I like the utility of having what is essentially a slim spare battery in my briefcase. I would never leave the house with it installed--it makes the phone far too slippery and heavy. For me, this item is basically a portable charger that magnetically attaches to the phone to charge it. Once the phone reached 100% charge, I would remove it and stow it away again in my briefcase. Again, I don't think of it as something to keep on the phone throughout the day, just a way to charge it.",1522873019280,1,False

1.0,Does not stay in place in vent (slips around),"I am very disappointed with this purchase. I had one like this without the ball joint, that did not move/articulate--just stayed in one place. It worked very well until after a couple of years the springs failed. I replaced it with this, thinking the ball joint would make it more useful, as it would move the phone about an inch closer to my fingertips and I could angle it as needed. In theory, this should have been a great car mount. In practice, it unfortunately fails, and here is why:<br /><br />The phone moves all over the place. If I tap the screen, my phone will tilt or turn. The ball joint is as tight as I can make it, and it still moves around a bit. However, the ball joint is not really the problem--the fingers that hold the entire thing into the vent are the problem. They do not grip the vanes in the vent strongly enough--it wiggles around all over the place. The ball joint will move a bit here and there, but really, it is movement at the connection to the vent point that is a problem. This was not a problem with the old one--the fingers of the vent holder were made of a grippier, rubber material than these. Simply put: these fingers slip, and the fingers on the one I replaced did not.<br /><br />I have ordered a replacement (another of the one I had before--$1.52 with free shipping--find it on here if you like), and it will take a month to get here from China, but it will be worth it. I plan on throwing this one away when the other arrives. I cannot recommend this item. Poorly executed. Needs grippier fingers to hold it in place.",1482953966000,0,True
2.0,"Holds up very well (durable), but has discolored over time","*Updated review*<br /><br />Well, it has been 10 months, and I find myself wondering about the warranty, because it's shot. It has completely discolored and is yellowed. This, despite being hand washed, as directed, approximately once a month(ish). I tossed the packaging long ago, so have no warranty information. It is still protecting the phone as well as ever, and actually has not cracked or torn at all--seema very durable. Unfortunately, my phone looks terrible now in its vaguely urine-colored case. Needs replacing. Disappointed. :(<br /><br />---<br />Initial review in October 2016:<br /><br />This is exactly what I wanted for my Moto Droid Z Force. Well, almost--I wish there were a similar case that fit with the Tumi wireless charging battery Moto Mod installed, but apparently such a thing does not exist. Barring the invention of such an item (*arches eyebrow at Tumi*), this case is perfect. The screen is already shatterproof and does not require additional protection, so for the first time in years I do not need to have my phone in a huge (very effective) Otterbox Defender. What a nice change! I purchased this case because it was transparent and provided protection against scratches if I drop it. It fits perfectly, looks great, seems well made, provides much improved grip on the phone, and does exactly what I wanted it to do. The microdots inside keep the back from sticking to the phone, so it really does look good installed--very slick. Well, except for the fingerprints, but that's just the way it is--any clear case is going to show fingerprints. Nothing you can do about that other than clean it regularly, as you do with your phone's screen. Very happy thus far with this purchase. I do take it on and off daily though (so I can attach the Tumi mod--I don't leave it on because the mod doubles the phone's weight), and time will tell if it stands up to that sort of frequent on-off use (I sort of expect it to tear or crack at some point--when/if it does, I will update this review). $8 very well spent.",1478461164000,3,True
5.0,Hands-down the best protection you can get for your phone.,"This replaced my a Trident Cyclops case for my Nokia Lumia Icon (929). The trident case looked better, but was not made well. Without any abuse--it only fell once--I take good care of my gadgets, it died within a year. This is as solid as a rock. I literally do not worry about anything happening to my pone in this case. The only thing I need to worry about is water. This is not a waterproof case. It fees 10x more solidly made than the Trident Cyclops, and if the rumors are true (and I suspect they are), it is. Finally put one of my phones in the ultimate case, and I'm never looking back. Worth it for the peace of mind.",1439053943000,0,True

Seriously. 2 stars for the cool minimalist design, but -3 stars because it does not open wide enough for my phone, which renders it useless. This means it would also not open wide enough to hold several other phones in protective (think Otterbox or Trident) cases. Returned.<br /><br />PS. Although I ordered it new, the box it came in has been kicked around a while and looks to have had stickers torn off it. Shipped direct from Kenu, not Amazon, as I expected (odd..).",1406837676000,0,True
1.0,"After initial warranty replacement (defective), the replacement died exactly one year later. Verdict: this case is NOT durable.","FINAL UPDATE:  The ridiculously good-looking white Trident Cyclops case for my Nokia Lumia Icon finally died--the silicone tore at both access ports (headphones, USB) simultaneously, and something had broken inside about a month ago, preventing it from fitting snugly so the screen protector was slightly elevated off the screen on the right side (annoying!). It lasted exactly one year from the day the warranty replacement arrived. Verdict: essentially junk. For the price (about $30 at the time), a phone case should last more than one year (note one year is also the warranty period on this case--aha...).<br /><br />Replacement is an Otterbox Defender (I know, I know--I should have started there), the first one I have ever had on a phone (I do have an Otterbox on my Kindle DX and have for ages). What a difference in build quality! The Otterbox is a vastly superior product--feels much more durable/rugged. I won't be throwing it off the roof any time soon, but I could see how the phone would survive in it. Best part: got it from a third-party seller on Amazon for $11, new. Happy camper.  Sorry Trident, but this product was just not well engineered. It is also worth noting that I have a Trident Aegis case on my smaller Kindle 3 (yes, I'm a gadget geek), and the silicone has torn on that too. Lesson learned: No more Trident products for me.<br /><br />---<br /><br />UPDATE:  Got the warranty replacement from Trident. They did fix the design and the camera button works normally now. However, and this may or may not have anything to do with the changes they made, the replacement case front piece (includes the screen protector) does not fit as snugly as before, and makes using it an exercise in frustration. Solution: I used the original front piece with the replacement back piece, and this mostly fixed the problem (although it is still not as tight to the screen as before). I sent Trident back the original (defective) back and the new front. I now have a case with a normally functioning camera button and a usable front screen protector.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Love the look and feel of this case. The built-in screen protector affects the sensitivity touch screen slightly--especially noticeable around the edges (frustrating at times). Although I hoped to receive the updated (corrected) design with my original order, my case had the known camera button defect. One press in camera mode produces 4+ photos. In the process of a warranty exchange with OEM (Trident) now. Definitely a PITA. Otherwise, like the case.<br /><br />Note: this case is thick enough that magnetic car mounts, even those that include additional metal plates you can install between the case and the phone, will NOT work. I bought and tried the Scoche Magic mount (http://www.amazon.com/SCOSCHE-MagicMount--Magnetic-Window-devices/dp/B00I608BHU), and returned it. :(<br /><br />Protection: seems very durable and well-made. I do not worry about dropping my phone in this case. An added plus, the camera lens is recessed into the case deeply enough to prevent most accidental fingerprints--awesome.",1405403708000,1,True

It has all the features of those marketed by the larger companies, but for a very reasonable price.  I compared this item to those from other, larger companies prior to purchasing from LorimaDirect.

5.0,Incredibly useful,"We received our iPhones with c-port charging cables but every plug we have in the home has a standard USB plug. The one outlet we had where there was a built in c-port just died.<br /><br />What I noticed is that the c-port chargers charge faster than standard USB. This has the bonus of having both types. I was able to charge my phone faster with the USB-C vs the standard USB with this same plug. My wife and I both have iPhone 11s so I put hers on standard and mine on c. Mine charged about 50% faster. Neither of us used our phones during charging.<br /><br />I am not sure if the charging time is better overall with this plug but it doesn’t seem to get incredibly hot like the standard plugs we’ve received in the past.<br /><br />Great product, definitely recommend",1677179598759,0,True
5.0,Great holder,I picked this item up because my old holder broke and it seemed to do more damage to my dash than it did helping to hold my phone.<br /><br />The design here was very well thought through as there is the attachment point to the dash and then the supportive arm piece to aid in support.<br /><br />The flexibility is great and I like that I can easily put my phone into and remove easily out of the holder. It also has great stability for calls while driving as holding the phone is way too distracting (but I had issues with bouncing around while on calls using some other holders which one was a clip in for the vent and the other mounted to the dash).<br /><br />Really pleased!,1664548549597,0,True
5.0,Great case,We just picked this up for my sons new iPhone SE3. I wanted something that had a little kickstand that would serve as both a means of keeping the phone tilted / elevated because he usually watches shows on it. I also wanted it to serve as more support when it’s kicked out and would be similar to the pop style devices out there (but these always tend to be bulky IMO).<br /><br />So far it has worked great! It easily slid onto the phone. I haven’t tried to see if the slightly softer inner layer can separate from the outer layer that feels more like very dense silicone.<br /><br />My younger son “accidentally” dropped it off the counter today (he was upset he doesn’t also have a phone and it should be noted he’s almost the ripe old age of 5) and it landed directly on the face of the phone. Luckily the case allows for space between the screen and outside of the case. It survived! No case scratches and no issues for the phone.,1649310453019,0,True
5.0,Replacement,I grabbed one of these to replace the one on my old phone. I’ve had the overall setup for several years and it’s always worth it to keep going. The metallic surface around the red center can wear in time but it’s due to friction since it’s magnetic and pulls in magnetic materials which can scratch.<br /><br />This with the ball that attaches to the dash is great. This is a replacement works incredibly well too!,1639076861524,0,True
5.0,Great buy,I just got an iphone 11 and realized I needed a new cover and scrambled to find one that wasn't too expensive. I normally opt for Otterbox but the pricing seemed to increase recently and this one popped up as a related item in the search. I decided to give it a try and worst case I could return it.<br /><br />I am very please with the purchase. It is a one piece case (some have a hard portion and a soft silicone portion to attach). This case fits like a glove and all of the buttons work perfect. It is not bulky which is nice since the 11 is a longer/larger phone that I didn't want issues with keeping it in my pocket. The slim fit definitely helps this issue.<br /><br />As far as the grip the back side and all around the backside corners seems to be more of a dense plastic whereas the sides soften up slightly with more of a silicone feel. This is fantastic because it definitely has helped with it already falling on tile floor once as it hit in the corner and fell face down. I dreaded picking it up thinking I would already need a new screen. No marks at all on the case and the screen is intact with no damage!,1638887528693,0,True
4.0,Great Gimbal,"This was my first gimbal and I am very pleased. The packaging was great and really helps keep the gimbal snug.<br /><br />There is a charging cord (no wall plug), tripod, instruction manual, quick start manual, and the gimbal.<br /><br />The gimbal does require an app to be downloaded, however once you've got that setup you don't need to keep it connected to the app as it still functions outside of the app.<br /><br />I did find that with dark backgrounds it has difficult tracking your face and can cause the gimbal to turn at random. This made it frustrating as my initial recording attempts had a solid background. Once I tried it elsewhere it was far better.<br /><br />PRO TIP: If using the record feature through the app, TURN PHONE VOLUME UP, otherwise the recording will be incredibly quiet.<br /><br />I let my 3 year old and 9 year old give it a try and they handled it well and it still followed them properly.<br /><br />The tripod works incredibly well to keep any vlogger looking like the real deal as it follows you left to right as well as moving up and down. Obviously you won't want to be doing sprint drills, but if you are looking for something to allow you to move around, this is your ticket! The battery charge time is about 1 hr and it lasted through my near 1 hour of testing (though I did stop the video a few times). You also have features on the hand grip to adjust through different tracking styles as well as starting and stopping recording as well as taking photos (while in the app these work). You can check out the MOZA app to see the versatility and many options for recording and adjusting how you record or take photos.<br /><br />My only downgrade was an issue I resolved on my own and may be for many other gimbals in that the dark background caused issues. Other than that I HIGHLY recommend this product.",1607103453049,0,True
5.0,Held up versus other Otterbox's,"I don't recall which Otterbox I purchased previously, but it was similar and started to crack after about 8 months. I normally had to take that phone out of its' case (I used a card reader at the time that needed to be just the phone to properly connect).<br />This one has not had to withstand that type of consistent adding and removing, but has held up to several drops from my pocket to the ground. Everytime it's a cringe, but the Otterbox has saved the day (and a new phone screen).",1556816995065,0,True
2.0,Faded coloring,"The screen is lower in price for a reason. The color doesn't fully display properly and appears faded. The kit overall is definitely lower in price for a reason with the quality of the tools. I am not one to expect more out of less, but this one was less than expected. It worked which is why there is a 2 star rating, but worked at a limited capacity given the fading that occurred.<br />I did re-open and re-seal the connections just to be sure it wasn't a lack of full connection and that did not change the appearance.<br /><br />If you need a screen at the lowest possible price, this one is likely it, but it does come with the issue above.",1525895666780,1,True

5.0,Well over a year later still going strong,"I purchased this in May 2020 (it's now mid August 2021) and it is still functioning perfectly in my vehicle. It keeps my Samsumg A51 and my wife's A50 charged up when we drive on day and overnight trips, and it will fast charge both phones. It is one of the better car chargers that I have owned and used. Definitely recommend it.",1628867282747,2,True
5.0,Excellent design and functionality,"I purchased this to outfit a spare tripod for my wife to video some of my band performances. My original setup was an EXMAX Swivel Mini Tripod Ball Head and a relatively inexpensive phone holder for tripods. That arrangement works well for our phones (Samsung A50 series), and even with my older Note4.<br /><br />This particular mount has all of the functionality of the EXMAX model, as well as a phone mount that is included. It's so convenient and functional that it is now our primary setup. The best feature is how the phone mount part has swing-out lips that hold the phone absolutely in place. Even if you tilt the tripod ninety degrees the phone will not slip out.<br /><br />If you are looking for an all-in-one phone mount with flexible positioning, with added protection of gripping your phone regardless of positioning or orientation, this is a good solution. The surprisingly low cost (for what you get) is an added bonus.",1615835855884,3,True
5.0,Surprisingly nice,"This fit the A50 perfectly. It's a great wallet as well, although in that respect it's limited to a couple of cards/driver license, and not too many pieces of paper currency. If you are folding bills it will hold about five comfortably.<br /><br />The exterior provides good padding front and back if you accidentally drop your phone, and the holder into which you snap your phone adds a little more protection.<br /><br />My rating is mainly based on value for money. At the Verizon store where I purchased the phone a plain, bumper type holder was priced at nearly four times what this cost. Considering that those cases go for a few bucks here or other online sellers it's plain to see the value in this case.<br /><br />I did not rate this for durability because I have only had it for a week, but I am guessing that it will easily outlast the phone itself which (in my experience) dies before the contract runs out because of failures in fixed batteries.",1575220696341,0,True
5.0,"Only works with vehicles with 3.5mm AUX ports, but also works with most home stereo gear","I received mine as a free review sample. Note: if you are purchasing this for a vehicle the sound system must have a 3.5mm AUX port for this receiver to work. Many older vehicles do not have that port. If your vehicle lacks one, a better solution would be a bluetooth receiver that connects to your vehicle system using an FM radio signal.<br /><br />This is not limited to vehicle use. I am using mine to add bluetooth capability to a [[ASIN:B0077AMSNI Samson Expedition XP150 150-Watt Portable PA]], which has a 3.5mm input channel. I power this unit from a regular 1A USB power supply like those that come with most phones and tablets.<br /><br />Pairing and connecting from my Note 4 phone or Samsung tablet are easy. This goes into pairing mode when powered on, and I have not had any issues streaming music and backing tracks through it. I normally do not use the hands-free function, but I did test it and incoming and outgoing calls are clear and noise free.<br /><br />Bottom line: in my opinion, this is not as ideal as the FM solution I mentioned above for vehicles because of the need for a 3.5mm AUX port. However, for home stereo and on stage connections, this is perfect because even if your PA, amp or received only has RCA inputs, you can connect this device to them using an adapter such as [[ASIN:B000I23TTE C&E 30S1-01260 2 x RCA Male, 1 x 3.5mm Stereo Female, Y-Cable 6-Inch Gold Plated Connector]] or directly into the unit's AUX jack it it has one. That, plus an inexpensive 1A USB wall charger and you are in business.",1473660006000,0,False
5.0,Excellent solution when paired with the right monitor; recommend professional installation,"I received this as a free review sample. There are some detailed reviews that cover the physical and operational aspects so I am going to keep mine short.<br /><br />First, a recommendation: I would have this professionally installed. Yes, the kit that comes with it is more than complete and easy, but the nineteen foot AV cable is not a piece of cake to get into the dash or other mounting point. Also, it needs to be secured at intervals as you mount it to your vehicle's chassis (or interior). If you are handy at this, go for it, but trust me, if you are like me, it's well worth having it done.  Also, you will need to splice the power cable into your electrical system.<br /><br />Mounting the actual camera is easy. It holds its angle adjustment for normal street driving, and it definitely illuminates in the dark! Note, too, that you will need a monitor. I am using a [[ASIN:B01BECUNCC Pyle PLHR70 - Car rear view camera Monitor]] that works beautifully with this camera. Your total investment in hardware (camera and monitor) would come to around sixty bucks, and even if you have to pay an additional $120 or so for professional installation, you are still ahead compared to most packages, and definitely what a dealer would charge for an optional camera package on a new vehicle.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is one of the better back-up camera solutions I have used. I have owned a few, but this (and the monitor I cited) are the best combination that I have come across thus far.",1469322439000,1,False
5.0,"Works as well as other brands, but more comfortable","I received this as a free review sample. I've been using this for a few days (alternating among other compression socks from a different brand.) This pair is as effective as the other brand in managing swelling in my left leg from a trauma, but is vastly more comfortable.<br /><br />What I love about these versus the other is the way it breathes. Given that I live in a hot, humid place (and it's summer as I write this) that alone inspired me to rate it so highly. It's machine washable (I use cold/cold and regular cycle), which is another plus. Do note the product specs on this page because these are a blend of merino wool and synthetics.<br /><br />The compression aspect is equal to the other socks I use. I cannot honestly tell the difference one way or the other in that regard.<br /><br />Bottom line: you can have both compression AND comfort with these. Mine fit just as the chart indicated, so as long as you carefully measure per the product photos and description, then order the corresponding size in the chart, you should be happy with these socks.",1467217188000,0,False
4.0,"Poor person's iPhone 6 plus - older technology, but fast, functional and good if you are on a budget","I received this as a free review sample. My subtracted star is because the documentation is too small to adequately read. I am a fairly technical user who did not really need it, but for a non-technical person the mere act of finding the SIM slots, identifying which one to use, and how to insert the SIM card is daunting with the existing documentation. A large, single-sheet and well illustrated page would have gone a long way to making this a five star, consumer-friendly phone.<br /><br />Note: this is two versions of Android behind, but for me that is not a real issue. I am not sure if there is an upgrade path, but I do think that the KitKat version (4.4.2) that is on the phone is plenty functional for most people. The big surprise is how fast this phone is. I have been testing it for about a week with a T-Mobile card, and for web browsing where WiFi is available it is pretty close to my Note 4. YouTube video streaming is as smooth as it is on my Note 4, and other apps are just as fast. Bear in mind that I do not use apps that require fast processors, so if you are into game apps this phone may not be what you want.<br /><br />The camera for both photos and videos is pretty close to that on my Note 4 as well. The big difference between this and my [much more expensive] Note 4 is the Samsung can go a lot longer between battery charges. This phone is still decent in that area, but is nothing like the Note 4, so if you are a heavy user this aspect may be disappointing.<br /><br />Test calls were very clear in my area. I am in Central Florida and the area has excellent coverage for all of the major providers. Again, I would rate this as about on par with my Note 4 for making and receiving phone calls, but that is not exactly apples-to-apples since my Note 4 is on Verizon's 4G network and this phone is currently using T-Mobile's GSM service.<br /><br />This phone will accept micro SD cards up to 64GB, which does not completely meet my personal needs, but is probably more than enough for most people. The only other real issue other than the documentation shortcoming I mentioned above is the charging port on the phone requires a charging cable with a longer than normal micro USB end. The cable that ships with this phone has that end. If you want a spare, you can find cables that have that type of end, such as the [[ASIN:B00O7KPVEO Cellet Extra Long 8mm Tip Micro USB Charging/Data Sync Male Cable]].  I recommend purchasing one of those also.<br /><br />Basically this is a budget-priced smart phone that is approximately the same size as an iPhone 6 plus or Samsung Note series. It does not have the latest and greatest operating system or other features, but is still pretty fast and functional. For basic calling, web browsing, social networking and the such it is a great solution. For power users or folks who need (or want) the latest and greatest, this is probably not what you want.",1465993994000,1,False
5.0,Well made and perfect for cutting invasive bamboo stands,"I received these as a free review sample. Instead of beating around the bush I'll get to the reason why I gave it five stars: it will cut through bamboo, and not just shoots, but six-to-eight footers that are nearly an inch in diameter. That alone makes me love this because large areas of my property has become home to invasive bamboo that a neighbor planted and has taken over my yard as well as others in the neighborhood.<br /><br />These shears will cut through new bamboo up to eight feet tall with little effort. The operative word is 'new' because dead stands that are brown require a saw. These will also cut through brush and shrubs as fast and much easier than the other shears and trimmers I own, including long handle pruning shears.<br /><br />A final reason why I rated these so highly is the construction is first rate. I did notice a slight wobble where the pinned handles met, but the blade still seated perfectly into the channel in the opposite handle, and after using these for a full day the shears were still rock solid.  The handles are also nicely designed and easy to grip and operate for long periods - especially when cutting bamboo.<br /><br />Overall, these are well made and do a better job than other shears that I own or have used. Are they the best? Perhaps, but I cannot say for sure. I will say that they are perfect for my needs, and if I were to lose then I would not hesitate to replace them.",1461216435000,0,False
5.0,"Will support a Note 4 in an Otterbox Defender case, but read my caveats","I received this as a free review sample. The reason for five [solid] stars is this tiny holder firmly supports my Note 4 phone and its bulky [[ASIN:B00NF4SXSO OtterBox Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Case Defender Series]]. I would never thought!<br /><br />The holder was easily affixed to my 2014 Outlander's vent and did not budge either. I will say that this will probably not work well during the winter in areas where it actually gets cold and the heater is blasting because phones, and especially batteries have an inherent hatred of heat. Take that into consideration when making a purchase decision. Where I live we use air conditioning almost year round, with some exceptions, so for most of the time this will work perfectly as a phone mount.<br /><br />Another thing to take into consideration: you can orient your phone from portrait to landscape, or any angle in between, but it cannot be tilted. In some vehicles that may be an impediment. Finally, I have not been using this long enough to determine of the powerful magnet is going to cause problems with my Note 4's S-pen, but will caution you to also take that into consideration.<br /><br />Bottom line: if this style of holder works for you, it's a safe bet that it will support your phone in most case types.",1459655867000,0,False
5.0,Solid peformer and full featured for an entry level smart phone,"I purchased this phone on a two year contract direct from Verizon so am going to focus on the phone without commenting on price, which here is different from the deal that I received.<br /><br />I have had bad experiences with HTC in the past and have been more of a Samsung fan. However, this phone has exceeded my expectations. While I love the Samsung's Note series and have gone through the 2, 3 and 4, this phone is surprisingly close. The difference is the user interface and battery life. The interface is subjective, but the battery life is not in the same league as the Samsung Note 4. On the other hand, this phone has the same solid signal reception as the Samsung, and is every bit as intuitive to use.<br /><br />The screen is easy to read, and photos and video are decent (although not spectacular). Considering that this is more of an entry level phone, however, it is truly packed with features and is fast with web browsing and other network functions. While this is not super quick with games, for regular use it is plenty fast.<br /><br />I added a 32GB SD card, which more than compensated for the relatively small phone's internal memory, and person who I added to my plan and who is using this phone is thrilled.<br /><br />If you are looking for a full featured smartphone at an entry level price, this one - direct from Verizon - is a decent and solid phone that is easy to use. To be sure, it is not a Samsung, but it's darn close.",1456724440000,2,False
4.0,Excellent and affordable protection,"I purchased this because I wanted a rugged case for my Tab 4. I knew in advance that there was no screen protector, and did not want to spend a fortune. I was frankly surprised and pleased by the quality and level of protection that this case offers. In fact I would ALMOST put it on the same class as my OtterBox Defender cases that I am using on my Note 4 Phone and Tab Pro 8.4. It's not quite as good as those, but considering that this is a fourth of the price I would say it's a great deal.<br /><br />If there is one complaint, it's the lack of instructions. I had little trouble because I have installed the aforementioned OtterBox cases, which are as complex as this one. Had this been my first ruggedized case I probably would not be as enthusiastic considering how frustrating these cases can be for first time users. I did subtract a star for that reason.<br /><br />Here are a few features I do love. First, the raised lip around the screen does provide a lot of protection from face down falls (as long as it's a flat surface.) Second, all of the cutouts are precise and the buttons work a lot better than they do on my OtterBox cases, which are very finicky about alignment. This case is actually better in that regard. Finally, the case in no way interferes with screen real estate. I can access any part of the screen without interference.<br /><br />As for the stylus, I do not use them to begin with, so cannot comment on how well the one bundled with this case works. Same for the kickstand. I do not use those, so, again, cannot comment one way or the other.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a well made case that is almost as good as an OtterBox. Personally, I feel that this is one of my better purchases in recent months and am very pleased with it.",1456245360000,8,True
5.0,"Decent quality, especially for the price, but will not fit all phones in hardened cases","I received this as a free review sample. I tested it with Galaxy Note 4 and Note 5 phones (with various cases) and an iPhone 5S. Up front: this will NOT work with the larger Note 4 and 5 phones with an [[ASIN:B00NF4SXSO OtterBox Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Case Defender Series]]. Those cases and their similar competitors add too much additional bulk to the phone. That is not the fault of this armband bag because I tested some other cases, which work perfectly.<br /><br />The first case I tested - with a Note 5 - is the [[ASIN:B017IRCZEQ Note 5 Case,LBS [Vintage Classic Series] [Genuine Leather] Flip Cover Folio Case]]. Fit inside the bag with no tugging or other gymnastics. The second case, a [[ASIN:B0144MMRXM Galaxy Note 5 Battery Case, Bovon® 4200 mAh Ultra Slim Rechargeable Extended Charging Case Battery Pack Portable Backup Power Bank Case]], also fit with no issues.<br /><br />I also discovered that an iPhone 5S with a flip cover case would snugly fit into the smaller pocket, so if you have a smaller phone measuring no more than 5.25x3.25 inches with a case it will fit in the smaller pocket. For the larger pocket you can fit a phone - in case - measuring about 3.25x7.0 inches.<br /><br />The armband has elastic and velcro, which combine to give you a snug fit that is adjustable and comfortable. The construction is nicely made with strong zippers and water-repellent outer material with a thinly padded lining.<br /><br />Note that you should be using this case in conjunction with sports phones if you are going to use it for exercise. Removing and replacing the phone is a hassle if you are engaged in those endeavors. I tested it would with an inexpensive pair of  [[ASIN:B00RSUFT5G Bluetooth Earphones]] that allowed me to answer a test call as well as listen to music when I took this armband on a test walk around the block.",1453494253000,3,False
5.0,Not just for iPhones,"I received this as a free review sample. To be honest, there are a number of these sets, mainly differentiated by brand name, available. This is as good as any I have used and actually better than some. If there is any difference, it's the clip and this one is more versatile than some I have used.<br /><br />First, while this is designed for the iPhone 5S it works with a lot of phones and tablets. I tested it with the iPhone, but also with a Galaxy Note 4, which is much larger, and it worked. The reason why I rated this so highly is the clip actually worked with the Note 4 while it was encased in an [[ASIN:B00NF4SXSO OtterBox Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Case Defender Series]]. That won me over.<br /><br />The fisheye and macro 15x lenses fit the clip. To use the wide angle lens it has to be piggy-backed off the macro lens.  The effects are undistorted (on the two phones with which I tested it), and the fisheye is a step above many I have used because it does not have the heavy circle that most such lenses impose on photos. The circle is there, but it's more subtle.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a truly versatile kit. Yes, there are others that are close (and even identical) and I would rate all them - competitors included - the same five stars because they are an inexpensive way to add decent effects to a phone.",1453308654000,0,False
5.0,Excellent reflection and very light weight - do check the measurements before ordering,"I received this as a review sample. When I accepted it I specified Large because the chart in the product photos provided dimensions near to my body size. If you go by the chart in the photo you will receive the correct size. Do measure yourself fully clothed (and with winter attire if you plan to use this is year round) to make sure that you are not disappointed in the fit.<br /><br />This is light weight and made mainly of mesh with reflective strips and velcro fasteners. It comes with highly reflective arm bands as well as a storage bag. It easily folds to fit a backpack and it perfect for bicyclists. I did a night time test with a friend and this was easily spotted with my vehicle's headlights at twenty feet. Probably further, but I did a quick test to ensure that the reflective strips were visible.<br /><br />My only long term concern is the mesh construction. It's tough, but prone to snagging if you are using this in a wooded area. For regular street use I think the construction is more than adequate.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is definitely a good safety solution for pedestrians and cyclists. Do heed my advice about measuring and comparing to the chart in the product photos (and factoring in attire) to make sure you get the correct size.",1452826384000,0,False
5.0,Love the design,"I received this as a free review sample.  Jenny J.J.I.'s excellent and helpful December 2, 2015 review covers this case thoroughly. I am going to try not to repeat her thorough assessment and stick to a few things that I think set this apart.<br /><br />Foremost, this design is vastly different from the typical pouch style armband holders. That has pros and cons. On the pro side you can access any part of your screen without loss of sensitivity, as well as every button without a hassle. On the con side is in inclement weather or in harsh environments your phone is not protected against the elements. That can be remedied, though, by snapping the phone out of its holder and placing it in a more secure or protective area in the case of sudden rain, etc.<br /><br />Second, the case affords excellent protection. The lip of both the inner and outer shells are raised sufficiently to protect the screen. Although if you are not using a tempered glass screen protector you can still crack it if dropped in gravel. I know this from experience.<br /><br />Snapping the inner case out with the phone is a bit of a chore, but that also means that it's not going to jar loose during a jog or any other strenuous activity.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is different from any other activity-type armband case that I have used or tested for any model of phone. It's not for everyone, but if the pros I mentioned outweigh the cons for the way you plan to use it, this is worth considering. Personally I think it's superior for my uses, but that is something you have to decide for yourself.",1449165659000,15,False
5.0,"Essential of you have a newer laptop using USB C, but want to keep older USB peripherals","I received this as a free review sample. The overall construction is of the highest quality. The metal casings for the two ends are beefy, and the connections mate perfectly with USB A and C cables. The cable itself is pliable, but sturdy.<br /><br />At first glance the strain reliefs look a little too stubby. In reality, however, they are more than sufficient because the cable length is just under eight inches, so the bend radius does not require longer reliefs.<br /><br />Regarding speed, I did not measure that aspect to validate total compliance with the product specs. I had no issues synching to my Note 3 phone by attaching its OEM charging and synching cable to the USB A end, which is a crucial test since Samsung phones are finicky about proper cables.<br /><br />What I love is if you have a lot of legacy USB A cables and peripherals and are now in an USB C connector world you can still use them because this is really an adapter. I tried a few random devices like a mouse, an old camera and an old USB 2.0 hub and this adapter cable supported all of them. It will kick down to USB 1.1. That in itself is reason to get one of these if you have migrated up and still have favorite peripherals. Of course, this is also essential for connecting most phones and tablets to your laptop for synching,",1448329943000,1,False
5.0,Excellent basic protection,"I received this (and the clear sided model) as free review samples. This is a precise fit for an iPhone 5s and has an aesthetic quality as well.<br /><br />What I like about it is the design eliminates issues regarding charging cables, audio cables and the such. That's because the top and bottom are open. The two sides have slight curves on the tops and bottoms that firmly hold the phone while protecting it.<br /><br />Basic protection is provided because the sides are slightly taller than the phone, and curve slightly inward to protect your screen in non-harsh environments like offices. This case will also accommodate your phone with one of the thicker glass screen protectors like the [[ASIN:B00BT8L2MW Tech Armor Apple iPhone 5/5c/5s Premium Ballistic Glass Screen Protector]]. In fact, that protector (or one of similar quality) will significantly raise the protection level of this case.<br /><br />One additional level of basic protection is provided by the flexible sides that will absorb some shock if you drop your phone.<br /><br />Overall, this is an inexpensive and attractive case that will protect your phone to a degree. Since I was provided with two cases with different schemes I tested both. I much prefer the clear sided model because it does not mask the white iPhone I have. If you own the grey model, the black sided model is probably better. Colors aside, this plus a glass screen protector combine to provide good protection without adding bulk or weight to your phone.",1448294158000,2,False
5.0,Exellent protection,"I purchased this based on the recommendation of a friend. The case is a precise fit in all aspects. It's so precise that I had to remove the front screen protector because the [[ASIN:B00OZ9VXU8 Zagg Invisible Shield Glass Screen Protector]] that I also had installed would not allow the case to assemble until I did. The Zagg is super thin, so it shows just how close the tolerances are!<br /><br />All of the cutouts are also precise. The case does not hamper access to my S-Pen, and the charging and 3.5mm audio ports have tabs that seal them against water and dust. Frankly I do not need that level or protection, but if you work in harsh environments those are nice features.<br /><br />Installation is straightforward and easy. I had mine completely installed in about five minutes despite a little initial confusion from the storyboard part of the instructions. There are two steps in the procedure that do require attention: aligning the covers for the volume and power buttons. Those took mere seconds, but on the first attempt I did not have them properly seated.<br /><br />The way the rim around the screen is beveled and how it recesses the screen is a nice level of protection. I am guessing that the included screen protector is effective, but since I removed that so accommodate my Zagg glass protector I cannot say one way or the other.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a little on the bulky side, but is possibly the best protection there is. I've wrecked phones in the past by accidentally dropping them, and do not expect the same fate for my Note 4 with this case installed.",1447503793000,0,True
5.0,Passed the biggest test,"I purchased this from (and had installed) by my local Verizon store. In a nutshell it works because I dropped it on a sidewalk not an hour after getting it and my Note 4 suffered zero damage. The protector itself was also none the worse for the wear, so not only am I lucky, but this turned out to be an investment that saved me from my own clumsiness. If you've ever dropped a phone and cracked the screen you will understand what I am talking about.<br /><br />While I did not personally installed it I watched the technician while it was being done. It's a simple process as long as you take care and do not rush through it. I read the instructions later and he followed them to the letter. Granted, the guy who installed it probably has done hundreds of these things, but the guide tabs made it look foolproof.<br /><br />There are no sensitivity issues. I use my finger way more than the S-pen and this screen did not hamper any action even to the very edge of the screen. Personally I am sold and am going to purchase (and install myself) this protector on my tablets.<br /><br />Registering it on the Zagg site was quick and did not require a proof of purchase. Hopefully I will never have to test their guarantee for the shield, but it's nice to know that there is some level of additional assurance.<br /><br />Two parting notes: (1) the price at the time of this review is less than half what I paid for mine at the Verizon store. (2) Some reviewers reported receiving what looks like knock-offs. Stick to ordering from Amazon instead of third party sellers and the chances of that happening are greatly diminished, especially with the return policy.",1447289725000,0,False
5.0,"Requires a lighter, bumper stype case or direct application to back of phone","I received this as a free review sample eleven months ago. I keep it in my gig bag for then I am a front seat passenger in friends' vehicles. As such it has been used in a large number of vehicles and has worked in all of them with respect to mounting on vents.<br /><br />There are a few things you need to take into consideration. First, this does not work well with folio type cases that are leather (real or faux), or heavier cases. The best case is a bumper style. Or you can affix the metal piece (choice of round or oblong) directly to the back of your phone.<br /><br />This is capable of supporting a Note 4, which brings me to another consideration: the magnet will interfere with an S-pen on any of the Samsung Note series if you remove the pen and attempt to use it while mounted. If you do not remove the pen there is no problem.<br /><br />Finally, this works best during the summer months. My phones love air conditioning, but not heat. So, I would not recommend this during cold spells when you have your heater turned up.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is handy as a permanent or temporary mount. Heed the considerations and you will love it.",1445888625000,0,False
5.0,Very strudy and holds a Note 4,"I received this as a free review sample eight months ago. It is not permanently mounted in my vehicle, but I do use it when I and driving to unfamiliar places and want my phone's GPS display within visual contact - especially the last mile.<br /><br />Overall this is slightly more than ten inches long, with the gooseneck measuring in at seven inches. I can tilt the clip up to forty-five degrees, which is more than enough for my purposes. I mount mine on my windshield, so the 360 degree rotation capability is not important to me. I suppose if you are mounting this on a dash and sharing back and forth with a passenger that would be a nice feature.<br /><br />The clamp is quick and easy. I like it more than the spring loaded arms that some mounts use because I can accommodate my Note 4 phone and the flap case without having to remove the case.<br /><br />Another thing I like is the gooseneck holds the Note 4 in its case fairly steady. If I get into maniac driving mode taking fast, sharp turns it understandable moves around. When I am driving carefully it stays in place. For a Note 4 without a case, or a smaller, lighter phone the gooseneck may be even more stable.",1445748878000,0,False
5.0,Still going strong after nine months,"I received this as a free review sample nine months ago and it's still a workhorse.<br /><br />While ports 1 through 3 are designated as Apple ports, I have used them for various Android phones and tablets, as well as speakers and charging external batteries. Plus the remaining ports will, in fact, easily charge up an iPad. The key is those ports are optimized for the devices for which the are labeled, but are near universal.<br /><br />Before proceeding, I want to note that in addition to the Asus Transformer and iPod Classic that the specs list as incompatible, this charger will also not work with an HP TouchPad, Motorola Xoom or Blackberry Playbook.<br /><br />In the nine months that I have been using this it is my main charging station for HTC One Remix and Samsung Note 3 phones, an iPad 2 (older model with 30-pin connector), iPad Air 2, and Samsung Tab 3 10.1 and Tab Pro 12.2 tablets.Each device has charged from varying states of remaining battery to full as fast as they would on an OEM charger, and even when six of the eight ports are occupied with some hungry devices this charger is fast and does not overheat.<br /><br />Bottom line: there is nothing particularly innovative about this charger, but it's rock solid and is a real workhorse.",1440950524000,0,False
5.0,Superb quality,"I purchase this locally, so price and shipping are not relevant to my review.<br /><br />This cheese is made from cow milk so it's much milder than Roquefort, which is made from sheep milk. It's also less salty than its Italian cousin also made from cow milk, Gorgonzola.<br /><br />This cheese is easier to spread than the other two blues that I mentioned, and pairs beautifully with just about any white or red wine that I have tried. It even goes with Amarone, which is a difficult wine (for me) to pair with cheeses.<br /><br />According to Castello this is best served an hour after removing from refrigeration. For me I prefer sooner - as soon as fifteen minutes and no more than thirty. Nutritionally each 100 gram (3.5 ounce) serving is 431calories with 42 grams of fat, 13 grams of protein and 1600 mg of sodium. Pay close attention to that last number because if you have sodium restrictions you may have to pass this one up.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you like the milder blues this is a perfect one. In addition to wine this pairs wonderfully with coffee and a baguette, and with a piece of fruit makes the perfect breakfast.",1440511969000,4,False
5.0,"Nice, inexpensive set of lenses that are near universal","I received this set as a free review sample. This is not a pro quality kit, and it's priced accordingly. What it is, though, is a fun set of lenses that give you some interesting choices when using your phone or tablet for stills and even video.<br /><br />There are a few things that you need to know so you are not disappointed. Placing the lens holder over you device's camera lens needs to be precise. If you do not take the time to perfectly align them you will get a shadow or even a partial photo. Also, if your device's flash gets partially covered you will get some ruined shots as well. That is the price you pay for a universal fit that will accommodate most phones and tablets.<br /><br />This set fit my Samsung Note 3 phone, as well as both my Tab 3 10.1 and Tab Pro 12.2 tablets. The jaws of the clamp open a full 1/4 inch, so the claim that it will work with most covers is accurate. Some of the hardened cases may be a problem, but my thick, leather case was not a problem at all. You can also reach any device lens that is 11/16 of an inch or less from the device's edge, so this kit should work with 99% of the phones and tablets currently on the market.<br /><br />Each of the effects were as good as any of other universal lens kits that I have used. The fisheye was nothing special, but it worked as well as any. I like the macro lens the most because I was able to capture small details with the entire object and background in focus. My phone's camera gets a lot of credit for that, but the clip on lens consistently produced clear photos with decent detail. The wide angle piggy backs onto the macro lens, so when you open the package you are not being shortchanged - the third lens is screwed into the macro.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is an inexpensive way to add some interesting effects and capabilities to your device's internal camera. There are some tradeoffs, and you do need to take some care in how you position the lenses, but when you have them aligned (without hampering with the flash) the results are impressive.",1436106817000,3,False
4.0,Nice features for an inexpensive light - do have one concern,"I received this as a free review sample. To begin, Daniel G. Lebryk's June 10, 2015 covers this light in depth and I will attempt to avoid repeating his helpful information.<br /><br />This is not my first lightweight DMX style light, but it's the first that I have owned and used that is sound activated. The sound activation is a little tricky. It only responds to low frequeny signals, so unless you have subs or are biasing your mix heavily towards bass this light may not respond to sound. For the music I play it does not work, but I will guess that if you are a DJ or running heavy bass music it's a feature you will love. Of course this has DMX in and out connectors, so you can daisy-chain this light off of a controller.<br /><br />For folks like myself who use minimal effects with no DMX controller the back panel is an effective way to set your displays. Be aware that with the combinations and permutations of lighting styles and the 255 steps each for the Red,Green and Blue combinations it can be time consuming to set up. Especially when you have a single step up/down key to get to the settings. Fortunately you can stick with the program and mode features and get some attractive, basic displays, which is how I use this light. If you do decide to use a DMX controller and do not yet own one a good starter controller is the [[ASIN:B004STXY3E American Dj Supply RGB3C RGB Led Controller With Built In Colors And Shows]]. It's overkill for a single light, but if you are planning to purchase more than one of these lights it will greatly simplify setting them up and managing them.<br /><br />It comes with a bail that allows you to hang it or use it as a floor stand. Since this is a fairly lightweight and cool running light it is not going to overheat for shows up to five hours, nor will it or even a dozen of them, contribute to stage temperatures. I love that characteristic.<br /><br />One note about the UK style plug and the US style adapter: then I plug in or unplug I observed sparking. That is a concern and a reason why I subtracted a star. The culprit may be the adapter itself and not the light, but I did not have a spare laying around to confirm that. Since safety is paramount I need to highlight this as a potential issue that you should factor in when making a purchase decision.",1434290611000,1,False
5.0,"Perfect for not only the LG headsets, but the more generic HV-series too","I received this as a free review sample. It is ostensibly designed for the LG series of headsets (HBS-730, 750, 800 and 900), all of which are high end. However, it is also perfect for the more generic HV-series that are offered by a number of brands here.<br /><br />The case is a semi-hard model that has a nice foam insert that holds the headset and houses some accessories, as well as a top that has a mesh pocket for additional items. Although it's semi-hard it can take a lot of abuse and does an excellent job of protecting your phones.<br /><br />Out of the packaging there is a chemical odor that is caused by the synthetic material from which it's made, but that dissipates in hours. After a day it's not at all noticeable.<br /><br />Other features are a decent zipper that operates smoothly and has fine teeth that do not snag, and a pebble-grain textured top and bottom. The latter is actually functional because it's practically non-slip and provides for a tough exterior. Since I am somewhat sight challenges I personally like the bright red trim that makes this easy to spot. All black cases seem to blend into my piles of other stuff and hide right under my nose, so I do view the color scheme as a feature.<br /><br />If you own any of the phone models with which this will work it's an inexpensive way to protect them.",1431225619000,0,False
5.0,"Economy model,  but still has ample space and accommodates a Note 3","I received this as a free review sample along with a more luxurious model. I am going to make a comparison between the two since they are the same brand. The other case is the [[ASIN:B00SKKHY4C Smartphone zipper wallet case, Belfen® [Handmade genuine leather] [Gray]Zipper Wallet Case]]. The dimensions of both are identical, but this one is a lighter duty case (in my opinion) and the outer finish appears to be a thin layer of genuine leather over a synthetic backing. That is not a criticism as much as an observation. The higher end case I mentioned has a better finish and construction.<br /><br />This will easily hold my Note 3 phone, which is fairly large. The pockets and holders provide a lot of space and this can be used to downsize from a full purse without having to give up room for essentials. I was able to fit my phone encased in a [[ASIN:B00ESAGVLK Bear Motion Genuine Lambskin Folio Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 3]] and have room to spare. I am not sure some of the more ruggedized cases will fit and did not one on hand to try. It will hold my phone and case, and an array of credit and ID cards, case and a small notepad with no issues. In fact there was room to spare after I tested it with those items.<br /><br />When you first unpack it there is a slight chemical odor, but it quickly goes away. Unlike the premium case I mentioned above the outer covering also had that odor, which is why I suspect it's a thin piece of real leather over a synthetic backing. Considering the much lower price of this case that makes sense. I do love the non-slip textured surface of this one over the premium case's surface, and most of the construction of this one is identical to the premium case: heavy-duty zipper affixed to a reinforced cloth that is, in turn, sandwiched between the outer leather and the synthetic interior parts. The inside zipper is lighter duty and this case has no wrist strap.<br /><br />Although this is a budget model compared to the other one this brand offers it's sturdy, roomy and very functional. It's also attractive and I would have no problem giving it as a gift. The women to whom I've shown it all said they liked it (a few loved it), and that is another reason why I gave it a high rating.",1430378974000,0,False
5.0,Gorgeous and well constructed,"I received this as a free review sample and when I opened the package there was a slight chemical odor that quickly dissipated. I first thought it was because the outer finish was synthetic leather, but a sniff test indicated that the inner dividers and compartments were the culprits. The outer appears to be genuine, fine leather, although I am not sure if it's a thin layer over another material. Regardless, it's gorgeous and looks like the real thing down to the pores in the leather other natural imperfections that fine leather has.<br /><br />The inner compartments are roomy. As important they are nicely organized and if you are a woman who wants to ditch a heavy purse without compromising the space to carry an array of credit and ID cards, and other small items this is perfect. It easily holds my Note 3 phone, which is pretty large without a case as well as in a thin case like the [[ASIN:B00ESAGVLK Bear Motion Genuine Lambskin Folio Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 3]]. I was able to also fit the phone - inside a  [[ASIN:B00GOHUNO6 Fliptroniks Galaxy Note 3 Brown Real Leather Wallet Flip Case]] - in the middle compartment,  but could not add anything else and had a hard time zipping it. Of course, I expected that result because the Fliptroniks case is large and thick and has pockets itself.<br /><br />Construction is first rate. The heavy-duty zipper is affixed to a reinforced cloth that is, in turn, sandwiched between the thick outer leather and the synthetic interior parts. Even the metal loop to which the carry strap clips is well made and firmly affixed to the case itself.<br /><br />Finally, the outer part has multiple strips of leather that are used for both aesthetics and reinforcement, making this both attractive and rugged. The friend to whom I gave this case after I completed testing and reviewing was thrilled and loves it. That is the best testimony and it also contributed to my high rating.",1429116752000,5,False
4.0,Great sounding paperweight,"I received this as a free review sample and am only half joking about the paperweight part. It it heavy and if you are working out on a patio it actually is heavy enough to hold papers down in a stiff breeze.<br /><br />However, sound is the key reason why I rated it so highly. This one is biased towards the mid range - and in a wide frequency band that reaches a little into the highs and lows. The high end is nice and full, and the bass is the same. The bass is not in-your-face, but it's respectable, even with modern, bass-centric music.<br /><br />Volume is decent, but this is a speaker that you will want no farther away than two meters and preferably one. That range is perfect for a night stand or desk.<br /><br />The subtracted star is for spotty bluetooth range. Normally I am near this speaker, but if I am on the phone and wander even a few meters away the sound quality can take a dive. I am guessing that the receiver is either extra shielded by foil internally, or the heavy metal case is the culprit. Regardless, it's a limitation for folks who tend to wander away from the speaker.<br /><br />Pairing and connecting are a snap, so that is yet another reason why I still rated it so highly, and I did get five and a half solid hours of continuous play with the speaker cranked to max. That is impressive and another contributing factor to my high rating.",1428370890000,0,False
5.0,Superior construction and compatibility,"I have been using this brand's older style cable, the [[ASIN:B00MISM7F8 Aibocn® Apple Certified 30 Pin Charging Sync Data Cable]] for six straight months with zero issues. When I was offered a review sample of the Lightning model I accepted.<br /><br />My first test was with an iPad Plus where it performed flawlessly as a charging and as a synching cable. Another factor in my high rating is the MFi (Made for iPod/iPad/iPhone) logo on the packaging and looks nearly identical to the real thing. The only things different are there is no Apple logo on the cable and it does not carry the Apple price tag. There are fake MFi products on the market, but they do not stay there long because Apple diligently polices that sort of thing.<br /><br />Although I have only been using this cable for a few days my prior experience with the 30-pin model (which is still being used on an old iPad) leads me to believe that this cable will be just as reliable. The cable, USB-A connector and strain reliefs look identical, and the 8-pin end is a precise fit and seems equally as well made.",1426606221000,1,False
5.0,Definitely keeps your phone dry,"I received this as a review sample and tested most of the claims in the product description. Of course I did not verify that this can be submerged to sixty-six feet for an hour per claims, but I am inclined to believe that it can because the seal on this case when properly closed is truly water tight.<br /><br />Do read and head the instructions contained in the product images on this page. For one thing they are thorough, and for another no instructions come with this case. That is an oversight that I hope the company will rectify because these make great gifts, but without instructions the benefits of the design may not be realized. I did not subtract a star because of it, but was tempted.<br /><br />If you follow the instructions - including doing a test run with a piece of tissue - you will get the knack for enclosing your phone using the snap and sealing surfaces. It does take a little practice to get right, so take your time and you will be rewarded with a case that will truly protect your phone from the elements, including water up to sixty-six feet deep (not that you would be using your phone underwater.)<br /><br />I am not going to repeat the dimensions, which are also provided in the product description, but will say that it easily accommodated my Note 3. Be aware that even the large Note 3 can slide around inside the case and require nudging or squeezing the edges of the case to center so you can see the full screen. Surprisingly I was able to interact with the screen inside the case as well as manage to turn it on and off using the right side button.<br /><br />This is ideal for folks who work in harsh environments, including dusty ones. It's also perfect for first responders who encounter similar environments.",1425256161000,1,False
5.0,"Multi-purpose, but may not work with S-Pen phones","I received a set of these as a review sample and can attest that the magnets are amazingly strong. If you follow the instructions to a letter the entire system or metal strip and magnet will attach to nearly anything.<br /><br />A single magnet/strip combination will easily hold a one pound object in place. More perhaps, but that is the test weight I used. Plus it will stick to most synthetic leathers - another test - and possibly real leather although I did not test that.<br /><br />My Note 3 phone with S-pen acted a little weird with the magnet on the back of an exterior case (one of those minimalist types). When the pen was in the holder it was no problem, but when I used the pen I got strange results sometimes regarding menus and selections. Factor that in if you are using a Samsung device that features an S-Pen.<br /><br />As other have stated, this is a one-way solution. Once installed it's pretty permanent.  On the other hand, you are not limited to phones or even permanently installing the metal strip. A pair of these holds sheet music firmly in place on one of my metal music stands without using the permanent adhesive backing.",1422848629000,2,False
5.0,Perfect as a video dolly,"I received one of these as a review sample and at first was at a loss for a real use. My Note 3's screen is too small for me to read at a distance of just a few feet, but I came across a genuine use. It makes a perfect in studio (or even an on stage) dolly for shooting videos while practicing or performing.<br /><br />This plus a [[ASIN:B00J2QK6O8 Bluetooth Wireless Remote Control Camera Shutter Release]] have allowed me to mount and control my phone in a stable, easy to position manner. Plus I can roll it easily to reposition it. Depending on the surface I can also use this as a true camera dolly. On a hard surface it rolls without jitter, but on a carpet or uneven surface there is a lot of jitter when used as a dolly. For me that is not a problem, but if you do plan to use it the same way I am using mine take that into account.<br /><br />Most of the components are plastic, so this is fairly light and easy to transport if you are not using it in a specific room. Mine spends most of its life in my music studio, but I have taken it out and the weight and form factor make it convenient.<br /><br />Some assembly is required, but it's simple and straight forward. The clamp that holds your phone is solid and firmly grips. The jaws open to 3.5 inches, and that is more than enough for my Samsung Galaxy Note 3. I have no qualms positioning it in portrait mode despite the lack of a lip. The spring pressure does an excellent job.<br /><br />I would love to  be able to purchase a larger clamp that can hold my 10.1 inch tablet so I can choose to use this stand for my current purpose or as a tablet stand. Hopefully the manufacturer will see this review and consider it. As is, however, this has proven to be a lot more handy that I originally thought and functions as a genuine solution for capturing practice sessions and performances.",1421981132000,1,False
5.0,Works as advertized and is a fast USB charger as well,"There are already some excellent reviews, so I am going to confine mine to a few observations. The review sample that I received worked flawlessly. I personally tested it as a battery backup for my Note 3 phone, and my sister-in-law used it to jump start her motorcycle.<br /><br />Frankly I was not surprised that this jump started a motorcycle because I used a similar product to jump start a car a few months ago. What does surprise me is the speed this recharges my Note 3 phone with its 3300mAh battery. When I am using a fast wall charger I can get a charging rate of 1% per 2.5 minutes. This battery was only five seconds longer per percent, which beats most wall chargers and every other battery I have ever tested. In fact, that is one of the primary reasons why I awarded this kit five stars.<br /><br />Another reason why I rated this so highly is it comes in a well organized, zippered case that stores in the center console (or the glove box) of my 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander. While I am not crazy about the non-standard barrel connector chargers (I would have preferred standard USB styles), I understand the reason for them because this battery requires a 14 volt charging source versus the  5 volt one common to USB devices. At lease this includes both a wall and car charger.<br /><br />One final note: this is rated at - and does store - 8000mAh of juice. However for charging phones and tablets do not expect more than 5600mAh, which is still respectable. The reason is all batteries using this technology lose 16% of the capacity from heat and the actual transfer process and another 14% from the charging cable itself. Factor that in if you intend to use this as a device backup as well as a jump starter. For me I have other batteries for my phone and tablets, so this one sits in my car ready for that inevitable time when I forgot to turn off my lights and need to  be somewhere in a hurry.",1421248104000,3,False
5.0,For selfies and more,"I have verified that the review sample that I received will will fit a Samsung Note 3 phone and an iPhone 6 Plus. If you have one of the larger phones the chances are that it will fit. This one has bluetooth shutter control, which is a major plus as far as I am concerned.  If you are comparison shopping keep in mind tnat there are more than one type of these on the market even though they all look similar.<br /><br />Personally I am not a selfie sort of person (if you saw a clear photo of my face you'd know why). Where this excels for me is it's ideal for steadying my camera on tables, balcony rails and other spots. This allows me to take some great photos. Of course, it certainly works for selfies, but is ideal for taking steady shots of panoramic views and close ups of smaller objects. If you use your camera for a lot of photography or videos this is actually an essential accessory.<br /><br />When you first unbox this and set it up the top hook seems to be fixed, but is actually a spring loaded grabber arm. The bottom part of the adapter that attaches to the telescoping handle is also adjustable, but it manually slides.<br /><br />Pairing and connecting is very easy. I literally switched it on, scanned for it and it popped up as an available bluetooth device. Since it's coded as an input device it will not interfere with head sets and hand's free receivers. Both can be connected to your phone simultaneously. A press of the trigger and you snap photos without jitter that is associated with manually snapping them. And for the intended purpose - self pictures - it is both cleverly designed and very effective.",1421246759000,0,False
5.0,Great features and performance,"Bob Tobias' excellent December 28, 2014 review covers most of the physical attributes, so I will confine my review to general observations. I have been using my review sample for a week and generally like it.<br /><br />One reason for the five stars is the fact that this is both a speaker and a battery backup. Another reason is the sound quality is not only respectable, but this one can crank up a little louder than most bluetooth speakers in its class. Of course, having the ability to play back from memory cards is a plus for me since I have a huge music library than is stored on that type of media.<br /><br />Note that some of the features are hidden bu a fabric (and elastic) band around the top of the speaker housing. This band is really a carrying strap, and out of the box you will not immediately see the TF card slot and charging ports, The instructions are the weak point and make no mention of this.<br /><br />Sound is fairly even and continuous across the three major frequency bands. The highs seamlessly blend into the mid range, which, in turn, blend into the low end. And the lows are not wimpy. With the volume cranked this is more than a personal speaker - it can  be clearly heard from six plus meters away. Moreover, the high end does not break up when this is cranked to the maximum setting.<br /><br />As for the battery back-up, this unit will store the full 8000mAh, but do not expect more than 5600mAh of back up from it. This is because all batteries using this technology lose 16% of the stored power from heat and the transfer process, and another 14% from cable inefficiencies. On the other hand even the 5600mAh will more than double the use time of most smart phones and substantially boost the use time of tablets, so that feature is valuable.<br /><br />Overall this is a great speaker for camping, outings and for road warriors who spend too much time in airports and hotels. It has a lot of features packed into a relatively small form factor, and those features actually work better than most speakers (and battery back ups) that I have tested.",1420981219000,1,False
5.0,Great add on for Note 3 phones,"I received one of these as a review sample and was a little put off by the color scheme at first. Not that it was bad, but not exactly becoming for a 66 year old geezer. I quickly got over that because I can assure you I no longer have to search for my phone when I forget where I put it - the color scheme is like a beacon. Of course it still raises eyebrows when I pull it out in public.<br /><br />What I love is this case is well made. I had some concerns about the insert that holds the phone in place, especially with respect to how well it would grip the phone, but thus far it has done its job well. I do like the fact that you can use the case as a stand to prop up your phone.<br /><br />The included screen protector is a nice touch. This also comes with a stylus, but I gave that away since the Note 3's S-Pen is all the stylus one needs. There is a carrying strap that is more for female users, but, again, is a nice touch that adds value to the package.<br /><br />Bonus features aside, the reason why I gave this case five stars is the fit of the Note 3, the fact that it offers excellent protection, and the overall construction.",1418735638000,0,False
5.0,Rock solid and holds a Note 3 in its case,"First I want to address some complaints about the suction cup not holding - when you receive this mount there is a clear, thin backing on the suction cup that needs to be peeled off. While it's still affixed to the cup this mount will not adhere to anything including glass, After it has been removed it will stick to even the pebble grain dash in my vehicle. I have no clue why the backing is on the cup, but it MUST be removed before you can use this mount.<br /><br />Mine arrived as a review sample and The first thing I checked is whether or not it would hold my Galaxy Note 3. It does and even without having to remove it from the fat [[ASIN:B00GOHUNO6 Fliptroniks Chocolate Panther Leather Wallet Case]]. The flexible neck is truly heavy duty and I recommend adjusting it before affixing your mount to your dash or window. The reason is the neck is so thick and still that bending it after it's on the dash may actually break the suction. On the plus side this will hold your phone as steady as a rock.<br /><br />The mount itself is actually a clamp with inserts (the red strips in the photo) that protect against marring your phone when it's in the clamp's jaws. Like the neck, the action on the clamp is a little on the stiff side, but it will positively hold your phone in place.<br /><br />Bottom line: the only thing wrong with this mount is there is no warning about removing the suction cup's protective backing, which can be frustrating if you are not aware of it. But there is so much right, including the fact that it can firmly and steadily hold large and heavy phones and adjust to just about any viewing angle you need.",1416888981000,92,False
4.0,"Solid clamp that can hold a Note 3, but cramped in some ways","I tested the review sample that I received on both handlebars and a boom microphone stand. It attaches solidly and will actually fit small diameter bars. The design, though, is based on a two position pivot on the quick release part. That will accommodate just about any size handlebar.<br /><br />The clamp holds my Galaxy Note 3 phone in a steady and positive manner. It is capable of gripping it while it's in its case, but the case is the weak point that could slip out (it's a fairly thick leather case). The point is it will hold the gigantic Note 3 with room to spare, and has soft inserts that prevent marring the phone, as well as dampening vibrations.<br /><br />Why four stars? The swivel ball assembly and compression nut are difficult to tighten because of the size of the clamp. You can sufficiently tighten them, but it takes some time. Perhaps this is a design limitation since if the holder had a longer post that would prevent the problem, the phone would sit too high. I do know that as is the phone is perfectly placed (for me) on both handlebars and the microphone stand boom (where I really use this mount.)<br /><br />Overall, this will hold phones steady - at least over relatively smooth terrain. I wouldn't use it for off-road and dirt biking, but otherwise love it.",1416712183000,1,False
5.0,Not all cables are created equal,"Rarely do I have issues with cables when charging my Samsung Galaxy Note 3. I do, however, have problems with many cables when it comes to synching files to and from the Note 3. So when I test cables that is one of the critical tests to which I put it through. This cable does both and that is the main reason why I awarded it five stars.<br /><br />While the charging state displayed by LED color changes is a cool feature, the critical feature for me is reliability. I have not had this review sample long enough to make claims, but based on my examination of the overall cable and connectors I am confident that it will hold up over the long run. The construction is first rate in all critical areas from fit of connectors to cable thickness to strain reliefs.<br /><br />Bottom like: yes, it's cool. But the real value is twofold: (1) synch as well as charges, and (2) is well made and reliable.",1416121539000,0,False
5.0,Great if you need a central charger,"I'm almost ashamed to admit that I can consume the entire ten ports in this charger. Do be aware that while the charger itself is not particularly large (see the product specs for the dimensions), the amount of space taken up by phones, tablets and various devices is significant. My new charging area in which the review sample that I received is the centerpiece, is 4x2 feet and cable management is also a necessity. I am mentioning this because while this is a godsend for we gadget junkies, there are factors that you need to consider and space is at the top of the list.<br /><br />Since others have done a good job of reciting specs I'll avoid adding to that. There are some things that I love about this charger, and some things that you need to know.<br /><br />First, to set expectations, if you fully load this charger expect no more than 1.2 Amps per port. I know that the description says up to 2.4 Amps per port, but at 60 Watts total there are only 12 Amps total capacity. That means that you can get the full 2.4 Amps per port, but for only five of the ports simultaneously. Since the controller detects charging requirements, loading all ten ports with high current devices will drop all of them down to 1.1 Amps each. So if you have five tablets and want to charge them at 2 Amps each you can support two additional 1 Amp devices. Or if you have five 2.4 Amp devices, that is the max you can charge at the highest claimed charging rate.<br /><br />The above numbers are not as bad as they seem. I have three tablets, two phones and a plethora of speakers and other devices and this charger handles that gaggle of electronics at their max charging rates. My main test is to determine the fastest rate for a single port. I use a Galaxy Note 3 with a 3300mAh internal battery and the best time it gets from another wall charger I use. On the other charger the Note 3 charges 1% per 2.5 minutes. On this charger - with no other devices plugged in - the Note 3 charges in 2.8 minutes, which is a 28 second difference. For me that is an excellent number because I have other chargers that claim to be fast that take from over three up to six minutes to charge the phone 1%.<br /><br />As others have mentioned this charger is both quiet and runs cool. I have no qualms about leaving it in another room charging my gadgets overnight. Contrast that with other multi-port chargers that I have tested that run very hot when fully loaded. I always worry about fire and safety issues with those, so the running parameters of this one are yet another reason why I awarded it five stars.",1413882094000,0,False
5.0,High quality,"This cable is one of two review samples that I received from the manufacturer and like the other one, this is high quality and zero noise. As for the physical characteristics I fully agree with  B. Nguyen Tech Reviewer's October 12, 2014 review. The cable is practically tangle-free.<br /><br />I tested this with a few audio devices connected to the Aux port on my [[ASIN:B0035EHLZK Roland KC-110 3-Channel 30-Watt Stereo Mixing Keyboard Amplifier]]. Direct connects were absolutely noise free (I tested with a Galaxy Note 3 phone and Samsung Tab 3 10.1 tablet). I also tested a bluetooth received that I connected to the Aux port and streamed music from my Note 3. Again, noise-free. Also, there is no handling noise, which I also tested.<br /><br />In addition to a tangle free cable that is a full meter long, this also sports some beefy strain reliefs on each end. I have not owned this cable long enough to determine sturdiness, especially from the large amount of handling it will receive as I use it on gigs, If it does prematurely fail or becomes noisy from excessive handling I will update this review to reflect that. In the mean time it earns a solid five stars.",1413260356000,7,False
5.0,"Excellent protection. Can be used by either gender, but more suitable for women","This case can both protect your phone and double as a wallet. In fact, for women, it can double as a small purse because it has grommets on each end of the spline to hook in the included strap. More about that below.<br /><br />From a protection perspective this depends mainly on the inner plastic holder into which you snap your phone and the relatively stiff back and front cover. Also, the magnetic flap will keep the case in the closed position (assuming was was already closed and fastened) should you drop your phone. While there is little padding, the thickness of the outer case will still reduce shock. Regarding the magnetic flap, I tested that by first dropping it (empty, of course) on the floor and it held. I then literally threw it on the floor a few times, each with increasing force. The third time it popped open.<br /><br />Functionally, the cutouts for buttons, camera and other functions are precision cut. Plus the phone snapped into the hard, protective holder and stayed. I had to do a little prying to remove it, but that is not an issue for me. I actually appreciate the fact that if I were to drop the phone it's not going to pop out of the holder. Been there and done that with a different phone and case.<br /><br />The window style holder for a picture ID is a little short for my Florida driver's license, but it held it like a pocket. I would still have to remove it if I need to show ID to a TSA agent or other individual needing to see it. The credit card holders accommodated three cards without increasing the bulk of the case substantially, and the wallet holder will easily hold five bills of currency before it starts to bulk up.<br /><br />My review sample came with a faux leather strap with quick release fasteners on each end. They are designed to snap into the grommets on each end of the spline and function as a handle. The overall length is a little over 13.5 inches. This is more suitable for women, but without the strap this is easily a case that either gender can use. The 'leather' is actually a synthetic material. There is a very slight chemical odor when you first unbox it, but that goes away in less than thirty minutes. The important thing is no animal died and it's easy to wire clean if needed. Interestingly it can pass for real leather.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you've shopped for a decent case - even at that big box store - you know how pricy a good one can be. This is reasonably priced, well made and very functional.",1412513417000,4,False
5.0,Actually does protect,"I recently upgraded one of the phones on my plan to an S5, so when I was offered a review sample of this screen protector I accepted. I know, firsthand, that these tempered glass protectors work because I have one on my Note 3 and when I dropped it and it looked like my screen cracked it turns out it was the protective glass. The screen was unaffected. That glass was a different brand, but nearly identical to this one. And, no, I am not going to drop test this one to see.<br /><br />Installation is relatively simple and straightforward. You do need a steady hand and a good eye, but as importantly, you need to get your phone's screen as clean as possible. You can use the included alcohol swab, but I picked up a trick from a Verizon employee that ensures that it's clean: after swabbing down, let the screen dry, Then take some cellophane tape and lay the sticky side on the screen, then pick up and move to another spot. Repeat until the entire surface has been cleaned that way (and I recommend repeating again to make sure.) The kit includes a 'dust sticker' that works like the cellophane tape I mentioned, but I found the tape to be more effective.<br /><br />Once the screen is clean, peel back a little of the mask on the protector, line up with the screen and apply. Peel back the mask as you lay down the screen. If you have misaligned you can lift and reapply the screen, but that step needs to be done fairly quickly. The final step is to brush out the air bubbles. I used a plastic ruler's edge and a little (not much) pressure. I went vertically, then horizontally, and repeated. From there the screen looked like part of the phone.<br /><br />This protective screen is as sensitive as the screen on the phone. After it was installed my phone reacted to touch the exact same way it did before this protector was applied, and there is no real visual difference either. One final thing: the phone fit in it's case exactly as before the protector was put on. Bottom line: this is probably the best single thing you can get for a new phone. My experience with a different brand of a similar product convinced me.",1412511865000,3,False
5.0,Well constructed and passed the synch test,"Like the previous reviewer I received a four pack as a review sample. My first test of any USB cable is to see if it will support synching between my laptop and my Samsung Note 3 and Tab 3 10.1. Both of those are finicky when it comes to synching, although neither seems to care about cable quality when it comes to charging.<br /><br />Both devices synched and supported file transfers to and from an old ThinkPad T61<br /><br />Another test to which I put micro USB cables is to check the fit on my Note 3, which has a charging and synching port based on USB 3.0. USB 2.0 micro cables can be plugged into the right side of the port and perform both charging and synching, although the synching is at a lower speed. Some cables I have used were too tight a fit to that port and I could not use them for even charging. This one fit as though it was made for it. So, it passed another test.<br /><br />Finally, the cable has strain reliefs on each end, although the micro end looks a little small. Time will tell on that one. The insulating outer cover is shiny and the cable is a little stiffer than most. I am not sure why or what pros or cons it carries. For now I am giving this set five stars for the reasons mentioned above. If I experience premature failure I'll update this review accordingly. In the mean time these will get a workout because I already have two in chargers and two in my car for spares.",1411912656000,9,False
5.0,Quickly became my favorite charger,"The review sample that I received quickly became my favorite charger. I am fickle so 'favorite' is subject to change, but for the time being it is the one I use all of the time. Here are a few reasons why:<br /><br />First off, I do not have to worry about which device goes into which port. Nearly every other charger that I have owned and tested work best if a particular device like an Apple of Samsung is plugged into a port designed for it. To be sure, even those chargers will charge regardless of which port is used, but with less than perfect results. This one will detect and adapt the charging rate regardless of the device.<br /><br />Second, I love the 4.5 foot cable that ships with this. Wall chargers that plug directly into outlets have their place, but my living room is open and wall outlets are never where I need them. The cable allows me a lot of flexibility. Plus, since the cable is a detachable figure eight style I can purchase a longer one from even my local CVS is I need more length.<br /><br />Finally, the ability to charge five devices at 2 Amps per port (or four devices at 2.4 Amps) simultaneously is a big plus. I own two tablets and two smart phones and they charge very quickly off this charger, In fact, even my slowest charging device - the iPad 2 - charges 2 percent per minute, which is a speed record for it.<br /><br />I could go on, but I would only be repeating other reviews and product specs. The above reasons inspired me to award this five stars and while I normally donate my review samples I am keeping this one.",1411442455000,5,False
4.0,Five star product with terrible documentation,"Out of the box the review sample that I received was initially frustrating. There were no instructions, and even the scant ones on the retail box were not exactly helpful. Before I go too deeply into that experience I'll describe this light.<br /><br />It's basically a small, bright flashlight that runs off or an internal battery that charges from a standard 5V wall of car charger. Although it has a 3.5mm connector, that does not provide electrical signals - it's a convenient way to mount the light on devices that have a 3.5mm port.<br /><br />There is an optional mount adapter that is designed for iPhones, but I clipped it on to my Galaxy Note 3 and it worked. This is where the confusion lies because it ships with the light inserted into that mount's rail. In the absence of real instructions I had no idea how to make it work. This product page contained the real clues, and I finally figured it out by coming here. Had I given this as a gift it would have confused the recipient, and that is why I gave it four stars.<br /><br />The lights are bright and this will make a big difference if you are using your phone for photography. Or you can slip it from the iPhone mount and use it as a pocket flashlight. In that role it's super bright and does an excellent job of illuminating. It also works perfectly as a workbench light for close, detailed work or inspection (I restore vintage fountain pens and it's ideal for that.)<br /><br />Bottom line: the only thing standing in the way of a five star rating is better instructions. This is a versatile and effective light and with those instructions you can be using it immediately out of the box.",1410263219000,20,False
5.0,"Ideal for smaller, lighter phones","Heed the list of phones the title of this product lists because those are about the size of device with which this clever mount will accommodate. I received mine as a review sample and just had to see if it would hold my Galaxy Note 3 - it would not. Of course I was just checking since this is not claimed to be compatible with such big phones.<br /><br />It worked beautifully with an HTC Droid Incredible, and I briefly enlisted a friend's help to check her iPhone 5S, which also works with it.<br /><br />The design is clever in that it uses a magnet that can either go between the back of your phone and a bumper-style case, or the second one that has an adhesive backing that attaches directly to phones and cases. The magnet holds the phone firmly in place, even when driving over bumpy terrain. It's easy to remove your phone by using an up, down or lateral sliding motion.<br /><br />The suction cup worked on my vehicle's textured dash, and the holder was able to accommodate a decent viewing angle for either driver or passenger (depending on where it's placed on the dash.) One of my favorite features is how small this is folded down when not in use. It actually looks like an integral part of my dashboard.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you have a smaller, lighter phone this is a nice holder that is both unobtrusive and functional.",1409496682000,1,False
5.0,As good as the Samsung OEM battery,"When my review sample arrived I put it through a few tests to make sure that it is a viable replacement for a genuine Samsung battery. The first thing I noted, though, is the battery had a marking claiming that it was NFC (near field communications) enabled. I was a bit puzzled because my Note 3 is already enabled. A little research turned up the fact that this battery has an NFC antenna built into it that works with the NFC circuit and software in my phone. I tested this out with an NFC-enabled speaker and the new battery worked like the OEM one.<br /><br />The next test was to see if it would fully charge. It did. Other batteries that I have tested with my Note 3 would charge to 99%, then hover there forever. I discharged the battery down to 90% two additional times and recharged it to make sure this battery did not have memory effect issues. Each time the percentages, including the fully charged 100%, displayed accurately. It you are wondering what memory effect is, it's the erroneous detection and display of the actual capacity by your phone's battery management.<br /><br />This battery passed every test I put it through and more importantly I did not receive any complaints from my phone about an incompatible battery (that happened with another third party battery I tested about six months ago).<br /><br />Bottom line: if you are shopping for a good replacement battery and do not want to pay the outrageous prices carriers charge, this is a safe bet. It is as good as the one Samsung makes in my opinion. In fact, it's in my phone right now and will remain there. If problems do arise I will revise this review accordingly.",1402402312000,2,False
5.0,For power users,"There are some excellent reviews already posted that completely describe this battery. I will avoid repeating the physical characteristics and provide my own observations and experiences with the review sample that I received.<br /><br />This battery pack has the capacity to satisfy most power users who are glued to their phone. It will also provide a respectable margin of additional use time for the true geeks who are constantly glued to both a smart phone and a tablet. For that breed of power user even the 10400mAh capacity this provides may not be enough, but for ninety-nine percent of us this is more than ample.<br /><br />Before proceeding I want to disclose that I always multiply new battery packs by .9 to get a more realistic capacity. That's because there are some losses in efficiency from heat, the transfer process, condition of your charging cable and myriad other factors. Using my quick formula you can expect about 9360mAh from this battery.<br /><br />Even at the readjusted capacity you can expect some significant increases in use time. An Apple iPhone 5S with a stock 1560mAh battery will get an additional six hundred percent of use time attached to this. An iPad 2 with a stock 6930mAh battery will get slightly more than double its normal use time. Of course plugging two devices into this battery will alter the effective use time increases, but some very simple math will let you forecast how much.<br /><br />I tested this with a few devices, including an iPhone 5S, iPad 2, Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and Samsung Tab 3 10.1. In all cases I connected two devices simultaneously (Apples first, then the Samsungs) and the charging rate from this battery was slightly less than if I plugged each device individually into their respective OEM wall chargers. That's actually pretty impressive.<br /><br />Note that the instructions claim that you can charge this battery from a PC's USB port. I tried that on my ThinkPad T61 and it was extremely show compared to one of my Samsung wall chargers to which I connected it. This is more of a problem with my ThinkPad than the battery, but I wanted to point that out to set expectations.<br /><br />Bottom line: this battery pack is solid, reliable and has more than enough capacity for all but true power users. Mine is actually connected to the tablet on which I am writing this review - I trust it that much.",1402316173000,0,False
5.0,Passed the crucial test,"When my review sample arrived I immediately put it through the hardest test: synching my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 with my laptop. The reason that test is so difficult is the Note 3 is very finicky about cables when it comes to synching. It will charge with a generic cable (most of the time), but refuses to cooperate with anything but an original Samsung cable and a handful of other brands. It apparently likes this cable, which means that I do as well.<br /><br />I love the indicator light that shows when you are charging (red) as well as when your device is at one hundred percent (blue). The micro USB end fit my phone's [[ASIN:B00GOHUNO6 Fliptroniks Chocolate Panther Leather Wallet Case]], but could be a problem with some phone cases. The dimensions are .5 inches across and .25 inches thick with the actual micro USB connector about .25 inches long. Measure that for clearance before you commit to purchase if you think your case may cause a problem,<br /><br />The cable is long enough for my needs and is well constructed with a beefy outer insulator. It's flexible enough to be used in my car without any tangling problems, so I am very pleased with that aspect as well.  Overall this is truly a five star product based on the way I rate. If any issues do crop up in the future I will update this review and associated rating accordingly.",1401631902000,2,False
5.0,Perfect for MOST phones,"The review sample that I received is a clever system that gives you a choice of mounting options. One caveat: if you are using a Samsung phone with an S-pen and use the S-pen while driving the magnet can interfere with it. However, for most of us, even with S-pen models, this is not an issue because I use the driving interface in my car. I mention this to set expectations because it's not a flaw in the design.<br /><br />My Galaxy Note 3 is a little too big for this holder. Actually, it's more heavy than big because the holder is practically size-independent. It still works, but I worry about the magnet slipping. It is perfect for an iPhone 5S, though, and both the dash/windshield mount and the CD player mount work with the lighter phones like a charm.<br /><br />I love the 360 degree positioning. You can set either the base or CD mount to any viewing angle. The suction cup on the base mounting system clung to the textured surface of the dash on my 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander and held firmly even with the full weight of the iPhone 5S. It did not leave any ugly residue behind, and it attached to my windshield in the same firm manner.  My favorite option is the CD player attachment which places the phone exactly where I want it. I use bluetooth streaming in my car for music, so the only use I get from the CD player is using the slot for the holder.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a nice system that gives you two mounting options and works well with a lot of phones. Heed my caveats above when making a purchase decision, but if you have a device that is lighter you will be pleased with this kit.",1400766545000,0,False
5.0,Great party favors,"When I agreed to review these I expected a single review sample, but sometimes the universe works in strange ways because they arrived on the very day of a luau party. This synchronicity allowed me to see the smile factor these brought out in folks who received them as party favors.<br /><br />As a token gift they have a lot going for them: first, they are functional. But the cool thing is they are beautifully packaged and they are heavy (I am guessing that they are made from stamped stainless steel.)<br /><br />The 'thong' part of the flip-flop pulls out a little too easily, but I view that as part of a theme that can be dispensed with as soon as the opener itself winds up in the recipient's utensil drawer or glove box in their car.<br /><br />I gave these five stars because the smile factor is there. In fact, these seem to be more coveted than the decorative wine bottle stoppers that I gave out at a previous event. Of course I was delighted with the packaging and the weight, which gave the impression that I was giving out truly expensive party favors. These are ideal for luaus, beach parties and 1950s/60s themed events.",1399933407000,1,False
4.0,"Pushing it for larger phones, but for many phones it's ideal","I received a review sample and put it to the test. First, please read and heed Comdet's helpful April 6, 2014 review because some of the limitation cited are valid if you have a phone the size of a Samsung Galaxy Note II or larger. For iPhones or phones of similar size this holder does work well.<br /><br />My test with a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 indicates that not only is this a tight fit, but getting the phone into the jaws of the clamp was an exercise in frustration. Like Comdet mentioned, when I had the clamps at the last adjustment stop, opening the spring loaded jaw further to fit the Note 3 would disengage the jaw from the adjustment stop. If you remember what flypaper is, this cycle of events is akin to unsticking that stuff. The more you tried, the more frustrating it is.<br /><br />On the other hand, an iPhone 5S fit the clamp as though they were designed for each other and this product was transformed from a mechanical demon to an absolute joy to use. Among the reasons why it was a joy with the smaller phones are the protective strips on the sides of the clamp (the blue areas in the photos) that ensure your phone will not be marred or scratched. Another reason why I love this for the smaller phones is the suction cup holds strongly, even on the pebble-grained dashboard in my vehicle. And finally, the ability to swivel the phone to just about any conceivable angle adds a lot of convenience.  Some holders that I have tested were limited in viewing angle, so this one is a step ahead of that group.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you own a phone the size of a Note II or Note 3, look elsewhere because while this one will work, it's too much trouble in my opinion. If you own a smaller phone this one merits five stars and your consideration.",1396954566000,1,False
5.0,Some designer knocked one out of the park,"Most of the review samples I receive are a slight variation on the same theme, so when an exception like this one gets sent to me I smile. Before I go off on a tangent I want to describe this holder and why I love it.<br /><br />This is the first (and thus far only) holder that I have evaluated that will positively hold my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and keep it exactly where I want it. The two suction cup design is clever because it gives me not only more flexibility than other holds provide, but also a margin of safety. If one cup were to fail for any reason the other is strong enough to keep your precious phone or small tablet from becoming a projectile.<br /><br />The package ships with two holders - one for small tablets up to seven inches, and a smaller one for phones. The smaller one is the one that fits my Note 3. Both have spring loaded grabber arms that firmly hold your phone or tablet. There is a thin, soft film on the inside of the arms, but not on the part that contacts the back of your tablet or phone.<br /><br />There are two types of suction cups employed in the design. The base cup uses a lever to actuate a vacuum and it holds tightly to most surfaces. I tries nit out on my pebble-grained dashboard in my 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander and it gripped the surface like it became a part of it. That cup, though, was designed for the windshield, with the second cup designed to hold the flexible gooseneck stable from an attach point on your dashboard. It, too, held that surface firmly and made a big difference in stabilizing and supporting my Note 3.<br /><br />Unfortunately I have no tablets smaller than 10.1 inches, so was unable to test the larger holder. From the rock solid way the assembly held my Note 3, though, I have no doubt it will easily support any seven inch tablet on the market.<br /><br />Of all of the mounts that I have tested this one is a paragon of design, engineering and construction. It's easily a five star product and one I highly recommend.",1396437608000,67,False
5.0,Luxurious and functional,"I have a thing for cases so when I was offered a review sample of this one I leaped at the opportunity. This case stands out from others that I own in a number of ways.  First, the credit card/ID slots are wider than on most of the ones I own. Of the eight other ones I own all have slots that are 2.25 inches wide; this has slots that are 2 7/8 inches wide, so it's more versatile with respect to what I can store in this area of the case. The billfold area is correspondingly longer as well, which is handy if you are in or traveling to countries that use wider paper currency.<br /><br />However, what it most important to me is the protection that this case affords. I am going to directly compare this to the case I was using before this one arrived: a [[ASIN:B00ESAGVLK Bear Motion for Galaxy Note 3 - 100% Genuine Lambskin Folio Case]]. Both have precision cutouts for buttons, camera flash and even the same style hard plastic retainer part that firmly holds the Note 3 in place.  Here is where this case leaves that one in the dust:<br /><br />- Thicker Leather: this one has an outer and inner layer of leather on the front that provides a lot more padding and protection than the Bear Motion model. Of course this one is priced significantly higher than that one, so I am not questioning the basic value of the Bear Motion. It's just that I think this one is worth the premium price for the protection alone.<br /><br />- Heavier Fastener: the fastener on the Bear Motion model out after about six months of use. It was a fairly thin piece of leather. The fastener on this case is two layers of stitched leather that is thicker and stronger. I did extensively test this with the S-Pen and there is no interference from the magnetic closure. The magnet used is relatively weak. More about that below,<br /><br />- Back Side Protects: most of the cases I own have thicker fronts with the lack of the case thinner and less protective. This one has a thicker back side that provides more protection than any other case I own for the Note 3.<br /><br />There is one potentially weak spot and that is the way the magnetic fastener closes. It holds, but I am not sure it would stay shut and totally protect the phone by holding the front cover in place if I dropped it and it bounced. And frankly I just do not have the courage to do a drop test with my Note 3. The trade-off here is the convenience of a magnetic fastener without interfering with the S-Pen. I know that the snap style fasteners quickly wear out - that is evident on the Bear Motion case to which I am comparing this.<br /><br />The fact that this will be my Note 3's case going forward (unless something even better comes along) says it all. I love the looks, feel and the assurance that I have superb protection. Personally this one is worth every penny of the premium price and has already elicited compliments.",1395753905000,3,False
5.0,Perfect protection,"I just had to test this with a Note II and 3 even though the review sample I received did not list them as compatible. The Note II fit, albeit too tightly to be useful, and the Note 3 was a millimeter or two too wide.<br /><br />For the Note II I was able to perform any task or function that did not involve the S-pen (as expected) or take clear photos. Surprisingly the screen responded to my touches and swipes through the cover as though the phone was not encased in it. Conversations are a bit muffled though (I had to test that function too.)<br /><br />Using this is easy. There are two snaps that tightly seal the top of the case. Unsnap those, insert your phone, realign the sealed halves and close the snaps. I did not have the occasion to test the IPX8 certification claim of the ability to protect the phone to 100 feet submerged. I did submerge the case filled with tissue in a sink and it kept it bone dry. Not a very scientific test, but I had to know.<br /><br />While I am not sure why anyone would want to go diving with their phone, this case is perfect for emergency responders and others who work in harsh, wet environments and want maximum protection against water (or dust) damage. In that respect this is a great investment in protection that normal cases just won't provide.,",1394539326000,1,False
5.0,Case lives up to all ad claims,"This may be minimalist, but it's not minimal. For one thing the claim of precise fit is valid. It may seem like an easy thing to accomplish, but judging from other cases that I have tested and reviewed for the iPhone 5S it apparently isn't.<br /><br />The fit of this case, including access to buttons, ports and features is perfect. What I love is the case, which is made from thermoplastic polyurethane and does, indeed, absorb shocks. In fact I wish I could find such a case for my Galaxy Note 3 phone.<br /><br />As for the claim that this is 'crystal clear' all I can say is it's so transparent that it does not look like you have a case protecting your phone. The advantage is not just the look, but the fact that this case does not appreciably add to the size of your phone, and the weight difference is nominal.<br /><br />One final thing that I love about this case is the lip that goes around it us slightly curved inward. It's slightly raised above the screen, so your phone may survive a fall on a flat surface.<br /><br />If there is a single improvement that I would like to see it's a slightly enlarged cutout for the charging cable. This perfectly fits Apple's OEM cable, but there are some aftermarket cables that are a tad too large to properly seat. Of course, that is the fault of the cable manufacturer and not this case, which is perfect for genuine Apple parts.",1392195623000,0,False
5.0,Perfect solution for my household,"This is one of the most convenient chargers in my household. I received a review sample and loved the fact that the LEDs on the face indicate with is truly happening. By that I mean that if you plug a device into it and the corresponding LED does not light, you have a problem with either the cable or the device itself. In fact, that feature showed me that I had a problem with a bluetooth keyboard that did turn out to be defective. So the LEDs are more than a gimmick.<br /><br />The second thing I love is each of the four ports has individual overload protection. The advantage is if one port gets overloaded and shuts down the other devices that are connected will continue to charge. Plus you are not going to burn up an expensive phone or tablet if one of the ports does become overloaded.<br /><br />Having four fast charging ports, two of which are for tablets, is perfect for my household because we own an iPad, a Samsung Galaxy Tab 3 tablet, a Galaxy Note 3 phone and an iPhone 5S. This charger accommodates all four devices simultaneously and charges each (again simultaneously) as fast as the individual OEM chargers do for the tablets and phones.<br /><br />A final feature that I love is this is relatively compact and even fully loaded with some heavy duty cables all fit. That is important because some of the after market cables I use have large connectors and have caused problems fitting into other brands of multi-port chargers. The icing on the cake is this is a two prong charger, so it will plug into wall receptacles with only two prong plugs.<br /><br />This is perfect for home or travel and is a bargain when you compare price, features and function to other brands on the market.",1391692832000,0,False
5.0,"Clever Design, but may not work with S-Pen devices","I received a review sample and was thoroughly impressed with this mount for the following reasons:<br /><br />(1)It will adhere to irregular surfaces. I tested it on the dash of my car which has a textured surface to which all other suction-style mechanisms failed to adhere. This one not only held, but did not budge holding my Galaxy Note 3 phone. That device is nearly the size of a tablet, so if it can hold that it will pretty much hold any other phone currently on the market.<br /><br />(2) The magnet mechanism is slick. It does not limit you to a particular size of phone. No grab arms with their inherent limitations. There are four methods of using it, including affixing the magnet directly to the back cover of your phone with the adhesive patch, or merely inserting it between your phone and a case holding your phone. For heavier cases this did not work for me. My [[ASIN:B00ESAGVLK Bear Motion for Galaxy Note 3 Genuine Lambskin Folio Case]] added too much weight for the magnet to hold, but it's a very heavy case to start with. On the other hand it was a perfect solution for an iPhone 5S I tested with the [[ASIN:B00GS5ULOQ TOTALLEE Slim Skin iPhone 5 / 5S Snap On Hard Shell Case]], which is a more realistic test.<br /><br />One caveat: since this mount depends on a magnet I have to recommend against it for phones with S-pens (the Samsung Galaxy Note line) or similar devices. Magnets are known to cause issues for those types of phones. If you do not have such a device this is the best functioning phone mount I have come across and one I have no problem recommending to folks with devices that will work with it.",1391649482000,0,False
5.0,One of the best cases for sports and extreme activities,"The review sample I received makes no pretense of keeping the form factor of the iPhone slim and business like other cases on the market. This one is thick and is the best protection of any iPhone case that I have tested.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this is not ugly - or not to my eyes. I love the red trim and large stitching because it gives a no nonsense look. Moreover, the red trim makes it easy to spot if you drop it while hiking or participating in strenuous activities. The synthetic leather looks like the real thing too and even has a leather like texture across the surface.<br /><br />Looks aside, where this case excels is in protection. The case is heavily padded and rigid. The enclosure that holds the phone itself is a little taller than the phone, and is made from a slightly pliable material that will absorb some shock if you drop the phone. The top cover and body are heavily padded and I am pretty sure a phone would actually survive a fall out of a shirt pocket on a hard surface while in this case. I did not test that, of course, but one only has to handle this case with a phone inside to get that impression.<br /><br />Form and fit are also perfect. All controls and features are easily accessible, and the two card slot held my Florida driver license and my debit card.<br /><br />The only potential issue I could find is when the top cover is closed you cannot attach a charging cable. That is due to the nature of the design of the flap style cover and not a problem with tolerances. When the cover is open there is not a charging cable that will not fit - even some that are notorious for requiring you to remove the phone from the case.",1391094229000,3,False
5.0,Small and state-of-the-art,"Since my car is equipped with a factory hand's free bluetooth system I did not test this in the vehicle. Instead I am using this to wirelessly stream music to a home stereo system.<br /><br />When my review sample arrived I immediately replaced an aging Belkin F8Z492TTP Bluetooth Music Receiver that I had been using for the past three years with this receiver. The difference in the quality of my streamed music was immediately apparent. The sound quality now is like replacing my entire stereo instead of the bluetooth receiver.<br /><br />More importantly, the problems I had with signal quality and distance with the Belkin were eliminated. Despite the fact that bluetooth works best with the transmitting and receiving units are within line of sight I can walk into a room at the opposite end of my 2400 square foot house and still stream a clear, strong signal to the stereo.<br /><br />I tested the ability to connect two phones to this receiver for review purposes and it works as claimed. However, I doubt if I will use that feature since I am alone most of the time and this is set up in my house instead of my car. Still, it's a pretty advanced feature that I have not seen on any other received I have used or tested.<br /><br />Among the phones with which I have tested this are a Samsung Galaxy Note II and 3, an iPhone 4S and an iPad, and an iPhone 5S. It worked perfectly with all of those devices, and especially the iPhone 5S that did not play well with the Belkin that this received replaced.<br /><br />This ships as a complete kit. It includes a charging cable (albeit a relatively short one), a 3.5mm cable with male connectors on each end, and a 3.5mm female to dual 1/4 inch male RCA jack cable. So out of the box you can connect this to practically any car sound system, home stereo receiver or powered speaker.",1390746822000,0,False
5.0,"Simplicity, function and aesthetics","I received a review sample and was immediately taken with the craftsmanship. This is definitely genuine leather, with a finish that is as smooth as butter and a softness that only a fine leather has.<br /><br />However, while I love the look and feel, what impresses me the most is the simple design - it's a case with no pockets, snaps or Velcro. The piece that looks like a flap is really a wide leather hinge that allows you to flip the case open quickly for access to phone functions. There are no card slots or other features that will ultimately make this case bulky. It's simply a case for your phone. Your slip iPhone 5 of 5S will still be slim while being protected by this case.<br /><br />It's not just any case - the flap is padded, so your phone is amply protected when it's closed. Also, the case part into which you slip your phone is all leather, but feels reinforced and has sufficient rigidity to protect the sides and back of your phone. Finally, access to all controls and functions are prefect and precision. Plus there is absolutely no interference with your charging connection (and I tested it with a cable that is known to be problematic for some cases.) A final feature is the cutout for the camera lens and flash do not interfere with that function.<br /><br />Construction is first rate, from high grade leather to stitching that I am betting will outlast the life of your phone.<br /><br />I am more than pleased with this case for all of the reasons cited above and the reasonable price point.",1390344103000,1,False
5.0,Ideal for dual devices in your vehicle,"I received a review sample and was immediately impressed with the overall quality of the charger and cable. Both are certified under the Apple MFi (Made for iPhone/iPod/iPad) program. The level of quality that earned this certification is clearly evident.<br /><br />The cable is 3.5 feet long and is every bot as good as the OEM cable that ships with Apple products. Each end has a strain relief and the cable itself is heavy-duty. The Lightning and USB connectors mate perfectly with their respective ports.<br /><br />A key feature for me is the charger includes built-in protection against overcharging. Another feature is these chargers will accept 12 to 18 volts DC input and maintain a steady 5 volts DC output on each port.Since the rated capacity of each of the two chargers is 3.1A total (1.0 for a phone and 2.1 for tablets) this will simultaneously charge both devices (or two phones if you are traveling with a passenger.<br /><br />This kit also ships with a clear adhesive non-slip mat that you can affix to your dashboard to sit your phone on. Frankly I am not inclined to use them in my brand new car, but I did test one on a tabletop. They stick firmly, but can be easily peeled back and removed - and they are truly non-skid.<br /><br />I can honestly say that after testing numerous chargers and cables for a variety of devices the ones included in this set are truly five star.",1390182869000,0,False
5.0,Unbelievably luxurious while being functional,"A dear friend surprised me with this case for the holidays and it is ... exquisite is the only term that seems to fit.<br /><br />The leather is gorgeous and of the highest quality, and the stitching is perfect. I was a little put off initially by the design embossed on the cover, but have grown to love even that. Truth be known I would have preferred to not the 'bling' studs on the back side since there come across as a tad too feminine for a sixty five year old man. On the other hand, they do have a purpose - they slightly raise the case when it's sitting on a table, so would probably be a godsend if you knocked over a drink. Fortunately I have not put that to the test.<br /><br />All buttons, the S-Pen, camera lens and flash, and charging port are completely accessible. My phone fits the hard plastic case like a glove and is held securely in place. The flap is a snap type, so there are no magnets to interfere with the S-Pen.<br /><br />The pockets allow me to piggyback a a debit card and credit card on one slot, and a Florida driver's license in the other with room to spare for another card. If you carry more than four cards this may not be the case for you. It also holds folded US paper currency and my retired military ID in the wallet portion of the case.<br /><br />Bottom line: I love this case and am so pleased that someone was thoughtful enough to give it as a gift. I would have never thought to purchase one on my own, but when I upgrade my phone I am hoping there is a similar case by this company on the market because it's pure function and luxury.",1390095129000,2,False
5.0,Feather light protection,"I received a review sample and at first wondered why this was even a product. However, after snapping an iPhone 5S into it the value became immediately apparent.<br /><br />This case is slightly raised to protect the screen if you drop your phone on a flat, hard surface, so that is one level of protection that fits a value proposition of an inexpensive, minimalist case that is functional. Note that if dropped on uneven surfaces, or worse, stones, neither this nor many other cases on the market are going to be of much use.<br /><br />The material from which this case is constructed is interesting in that it's rigid enough to protect against hard surfaces and objects, but is also pliable and capable of absorbing (or at least mitigating) shocks from short distance drops.<br /><br />Another factor is the precision cutouts for your phone's buttons, camera lens and flash. Everything fits as though this was an integral part of the phone itself.<br /><br />Add in the fact that this is truly feather light and unobtrusive and you have the best of both worlds: nearly invisible protection that actually works.  The only thing that would make this an even better value is if the manufacturer finds a way to include a screen protector without raising the price point. However, as is, this is a great value in my opinion.",1389753614000,0,False
5.0,Works with my Galaxy Note 3,"Sid Nuncius excellent and very helpful review of December 12, 2013 covers most of the key points and I do not want to repeat them. My review is based on prior experience with sports armbands and I will focus on that comparison.<br /><br />I received a review sample and had a ready point of comparison: a [[ASIN:B00F8HJM36 Mobile Maiden XXL Smartphone Workout Armband]]. That band had a few limitations for newer phones, but this one takes the design of a sports armband to a whole new level.<br /><br />First, this works with the larger phones. My Samsung Galaxy Note 3 fit, as did my Note 2. If you have a smaller phone, though, it may actually get a little lost in the ample pouch. Physically the inside dimensions of the pouch are 7.75 by 3,75 inches (although the top has slightly rounded corners that will take off about an eight of an inch.) Until someone comes out with a phone larger than the Note 3 this is the pouch to get for large smartphones.<br /><br />Second, the armband is heavy duty in every way: the thick, clear face will protect the phone while allowing you to still use your fingers to control all screen functions, and the padded arm strap and case construction are a giant leap over the Mobile Maiden armband to which I am comparing this one. Sound quality is superb even in the heavy case, and the protection that the design affords makes this perfect for strenuous activities. Having your phone enclosed in a zippered case versus one that has a slot to insert your phone is another level of protection that earns this one five stars in my opinion.<br /><br />The bottom line is this is perfect for large smartphones up to the biggest on the market at the time of this review. The protection is the best I have come across and it's comfortable to wear. Do heed my caveat about using this will small smartphones because those may actually flop around inside the pouch.",1389033166000,74,False
5.0,Tested with iPhone 5C,"I received a review sample and tested this with an iPhone 5C. I enlisted the assistance of a friend who has a 5C to test this. Like others have noted the lightning connector end did not fit the charging port cutout on a bumper style case, but the connector itself fit the port perfectly once the phone was removed from the case.<br /><br />As soon as you plug this into a charger the ring on the lightning end flashes a second, then turns solid blue. While charging the ring will flash red, then return to solid blue once the phone is fully charged. On the 5C the phone was verified to be 100% charged when the indicator returned to blue. The test phone was relatively new, so the battery had not begun its gradual deterioration that happens to every battery regardless of phone or tablet brand. That may account for the disparity between my results and the one reported in the excellent and helpful December 9, 2013 review posted by buru buru piggu.<br /><br />The cable is a bit short at three feet, but well constructed. The lightning connector end is the culprit that prevents this cable from plugging into most cases and certainly the one on the phone with which this was tested. Had the light indicator ring been moved to the rear part of the connector the small jack of the lightning could be scaled to be a perfect replica of the OEM cable. Perhaps version 2 will incorporate that design. All other aspects of the cable indicate solid design and manufacturing, including close tolerances on the connections and strain reliefs on both ends of the cable.<br /><br />As with most review samples I donated this one after I completed my testing and review.",1386682833000,0,False
5.0,Definjitely genuine leather and not a bad grade either,"For the price this exceeded my expectations. I was expecting faux leather at worse, or a very poor grade at best. While the material is not 'fine Italian' leather, it's not bad. Pretty good in fact. You can clearly see the grain, and it smells like the real thing too.<br /><br />Fit is perfect. All of the cutouts for buttons, cameras and charging connection fit as though Samsung designed this case. Even the rather large Samsung USB 3.0 charging and data connector fit without any interference from the case. Other cases I have tried has issues there.<br /><br />The main value is the protection, and it does a wonderful job. The plastic part into which you snap in the phone is sturdy and firmly holds the phone in place. The leather exterior provides some padding that takes the protection a step further, and the snap tab is non-magnetic, so your S-Pen is not going to act funny.<br /><br />I can fit a Florida driver's license and two standard size credit/debit cards in the the slots in the top flap without any problem (or adding bulk). The currency part will not take US bills unless they are folded because the wallet part is a few fractions of an inch too short. It is the perfect width for US currency though.<br /><br />This was supposed to be an interim case until I had the funds to order a truly high end one. I think this is more than adequate because it has style and function at an amazing price point.",1386455878000,4,True
5.0,Exceptionally well made,"I received a review sample and agree with  Mark's very helpful November 5, 2013 review. Do read the dimensions carefully, though, before you purchase this model because it only fits phones of a certain size. Specifically, any phone that has a screen in the 4.3-5 inch range and is NOT larger than 3.3 inches wide or 5.5nches high will work.<br /><br />I tested this with an iPhone 4S and 5 and those fit perfectly. I knew my Samsung Galaxy Note II and Note 3 would not fit, but I had to try. No go, but this case is not designed for them.<br /><br />The heavy and strong armband is built to last, thanks to the dense webbing material and the generous amount of Velcro used. The latter makes this adjustable over a wide range, but this particular model is not designed for thin folks. I weigh over one ninety pounds - frankly I am overweight - and the band fit my arm in its smallest configuration. There is sufficient material to fit much larger folks, but I am guessing that if you are in the 150 pound or below range with thin biceps this is not going to work. End to end the band in it's smallest configuration measures about 12 inches. Use a tape measure around your arm to determine if it truly will fit.<br /><br />You can easily read the screen through the plastic protector, and you can also access buttons through it. The top of the case has a slot for access to the 3.5mm jack if you want to listen to music while running or participating in other sports. That is a nice touch that leads me to conclude that whoever designed this case actually uses one.<br /><br />It does not unduly muffle sound - you can hear and be clearly heard of you have your phone on speaker while wearing this. Of course you cannot do things like take photos unless you remove it from the case, but this is designed to keep your phone handy during sports activities.<br /><br />If you have a phone that fits this case and you want to keep it nearby while exercising or similar activities this case is ideal. Just be sure to measure it as I mentioned above if you are thin.",1386095603000,2,False
5.0,Excellent basic protection,"I ordered this case as an inexpensive interim solution until my budget allows me to get the [[ASIN:B00F5BOKGO Zenus Samsung Galaxy Note 3 Bohemian M Diary Wallet Case Cover [Brown] High End Genuine Leather Case for Galaxy Note III]]. That case, though, is a vanity purchase.<br /><br />This case is exceptionally well constructed and provides me with a layer of basic protection. Ever since cracking a screen on a phone I've insisted on a case. This one gives me a level of comfort. It is also convenient since I normally carry a few cards and my driver's license in the pockets. Those fit, but you cannot stuff this or it will simply not close properly.<br /><br />Things I love include the snap instead of a magnet (which would wreak havoc with the SPen), and the fact that this case appears to have been designed by someone who knew what they were doing because it fits the phone like a glove.<br /><br />I also love the conveniences like having the camera lens and all of the buttons and charging port accessible and unobstructed. Those and the fact that I do not need to replace the back cover of my phone with a kludge like some other cases are what sold me on it.<br /><br />Although it looks awkward to use for talking, it truly isn't. While this is an interim case I would have no problems using this as the only case for my Note 3 because, frankly, it does everything I want and need at an incredible price.",1385829167000,0,True
5.0,Smart looking case for folks who travel light,"I received a review sample of this case from the manufacturer and with a friend put it through its paces. The reason I enlisted the aid of a friend is because she is very picky about cases and I value her opinion since she is on a continuing quest for the perfect case.<br /><br />Here are the results:<br /><br />Construction: beautifully made and built to last. The leather is first class and the plastic parts seem to be of equal quality. More importantly the slot for the credit card (the outside pouch will only hold one) fit every one I tried with no pushing or tugging. The wallet portion is good for six more cards and perhaps two or three US paper currency bills. As a side note the outside pouch will also accommodate a Florida driver's license.<br /><br />Fit to Phone: every button and the entire screen were easily accessible. The layout is perfect in that respect. Considering the number of cases my friend and I have tested this is one of the best for a glove-like fit that does not hamper phone functions or use. Note that if you have never tried a case like this one on an iPhone you will be disappointed by the way pictures turn out. This case is no exception - photos were a little fuzzy, but not because of this case's design. Every single brand and model case I have tested on the 4S exhibits this problem: without the case the photos are sharp and with a case they are slightly fuzzy.<br /><br />Best Uses: this case is perfect for any situation where the phone does not require maximum protection. Business use? Yes. Vigorous sports and similar activities? I would not use this case in those situations because the screen is flush with the outer edge of the case itself. In other words, there is no added protection if you were to drop the phone on a hard surface. However, this is not marketed as a maximum protection style case, but I wanted to set expectations in this review.<br /><br />One final thought: This case was not subjected to long term testing or use so the effect of the magnet in the wallet flap on encoded strips on credit cards and some ID cards is not apparent. If cards start failing I will update this review to reflect that.<br /><br />This is an attractive and well made case that happens to be functional as well. It ranks in the top three of over a dozen cases I have purchased and is a keeper.",1379626551000,7,False
5.0,Snap it on and shoot,"I received a review sample in exchange for a review and have been having a blast with this simple-but-cool lens.<br /><br />The instructions discuss screwing the lens into a ""slim-line protective case"" when in fact that case is actually the clip and mine came  in the sealed package already installed. A few things you need to note:<br /><br />- If you are using a protective case for your phone (I am using a [[ASIN:B009VKSVTC Evecase Leather Wallet Case with Stand and Credit Card Holder for Samsung Galaxy Note 2]]) you need to remove your phone before you can clip on this lens.<br /><br />- This is a true fisheye lens that will capture a full 180 degrees. I took a shot of my music room, which normally takes three shots to fully capture and the one shot managed to include all of my amps, drums and instruments.<br /><br />- There is NO magnification. This is a straight through lens with the fisheye effect as the only feature.<br /><br />- Your photos will be framed in what will look like a black mat over a porthole. Sort of like a spy shot, and also ultra cool for some unique views of wide areas.<br /><br />I am concerned that the clip extends over my screen on my phone. There is a soft plastic patch with a slight texture that holds the lens in place and seems to protect the lens from scratching. On the other hand I had to reposition the lens to get to my camera icon on the screen. Since this is a new tool I am sure I will discover convenient workarounds. If so I will be sure to update this review.<br /><br />The package itself is simple: it comes with the lens pre-screwed into the clip, a small cloth bag and a lens cover. The latter is a nice touch. The price is nominal considering the quality of the photos I have taken with this already. In fact, I have been able to shoot some interesting pictures. It's a shame that Amazon has eliminated the customer-supplied image feature because a few pictures are worth thousands of words.<br /><br />For the price you cannot go wrong. Especially if you are used to shooting multiple times to get an entire subject. The best thing I can say is had I not been provided with a review sample I would purchased one of these anyway. They are that useful in certain situations and very high quality.",1374518554000,16,False
5.0,Basic protection and convenience with some flaws,"I purchased this and another color - [[ASIN:B00842ANMQ Black/Blue]] - for a friend who loved both colors and could not make up her mind. Considering the extremely low price I could afford the risk of receiving absolute junk. Fortunately it turned out to be an amazing value - but not without a few flaws.<br /><br />For basic protection and good looks this case is hard to beat. There are a few small details that were either overlooked or considered 'good enough' by the manufacturer, which I'll get into, but then this case cost less than five bucks shipped.<br /><br />The strongest factor is the material and the way it has been cut and assembled afford excellent protection for your phone. The wallet and card slots are very nice touches that add functionality to the case.<br /><br />Plus it's simply beautiful.<br /><br />There are a few minor issues with the case that need to be disclosed. First, the fit and cut-outs are not precise. The part that holds the phone in place is a little loose and imperfectly measured. This causes the phone to slide a little to the left in the holder, which makes accessing keys on the left side of the screen keyboard difficult. You can still use the keyboard, but with some difficulty. See one of the photos that I uploaded for a visual. Also note that the part that secures the phone is somewhat larger than the phone, which results in a loose fit. The phone will slide out too easily and possible fall if you are not careful. Forewarned is fore armed.<br /><br />Two other very minor issues are: (1) imprecise way the cut-out is aligned to the camera lens (this is more of a aesthetic defect because it does not hamper taking photos). (2) a loose stitch right at flap that can easily be trimmed. Both are documented in the photos I've uploaded. I thought the loose stitch was a fluke, but it's a flaw on both this one and the other one I purchased.<br /><br />Minor issues notwithstanding, this case is a bargain, and an eye-catching one at that. I personally feel that you cannot go wrong with it.",1361368109000,0,True
5.0,Five stars for value,"For basic protection and good looks this case is hard to beat. There are a few small details that were either overlooked or considered 'good enough' by the manufacturer, which I'll get into, but then this case cost less than five bucks shipped.<br /><br />I've uploaded six customer-supplied photos to visually highlight the strong and weak points.<br /><br />The strongest factor is the material and the way it has been cut and assembled afford excellent protection for your phone. The wallet and card slots are very nice touches that add functionality to the case.<br /><br />Plus it's simply beautiful. A case in point: I purchased this phone for a friend and took her to dinner. The server saw and fell in love with the case. She had paid over twenty dollars for her case, which did not have the wallet, credit card and ID slots, or the cover to completely protect her phone. When she found out the cost of this one she wrote down the particulars and vowed to order one for herself.<br /><br />There are a few minor issues with the case that need to be disclosed.

2.0,Price is right but the design falls short,"I've uploaded a number of customer-supplied photos at the top of this page to illustrate some key points and shortcomings of this combo case.<br /><br />First, the positive: the set is a three-part system of components that was designed to protect your phone and provide convenient features such as a belt clip that doubles as a kickstand. The manufacturer certainly invested in both quality materials and molds to deliver a set of components that will protect your phone.<br /><br />The components are a (1) soft skin that affords a degree of protection and is ideal for light use. (2) is a hard cover into which the phone - protected by the soft cover - snaps for solid protection, and (3) is the belt clip into which the phone with the first two assemblies snaps. Clever.<br /><br />Where everything calls short is the design tolerances. First, with just the soft cover installed the case interferes with screen real estate making some characters in the virtual keyboard hard to tap. Worse, the camera's picture quality is greatly diminished by the poor tolerance in the video port in the case. See photos I've uploaded for an illustration of that. Finally, although the design of the belt clip that doubles as a kickstand is clever (shown in a photo I provided), the fixed angle either horizontally or vertically is way less of optimum for viewing in my opinion.<br /><br />I wanted to love this case because the concept is clever and the construction is superb. It's the tolerances and design that are disappointing. I hope the manufacturer comes out with a version 2.0 that rectifies these shortcomings because I feel this would be a real winner. As it is, though, I recommend that you consider alternative products.",1358152355000,0,True
5.0,Exceptionally well designed and constructed,"Most cases I tried for my Galaxy Note 2 were poorly designed and cheaply made. I almost gave up. This one appears to have been designed by someone who knew what they were doing because it provides solid protection and fits the phone like a glove.<br /><br />The construction is also first-rate. I suspect that this will last me for the life of the phone.<br /><br />Conveniences like having the camera lens and all of the buttons and charging port accessible are what I especially love about this case. Those and the fact that I do not need to replace the back cover of my phone with a kludge like some other cases are what sold me on it.  I cannot speak to the functionality of the credit card pouch since I don't use that feature, but it would probably work with most cards and state driver licenses. A Florida license fits it.<br /><br />Although it looks awkward to use for talking, it truly isn't. The flap cover does not get in the way.  I have been toying with the idea of comparing it to this style of case - [[ASIN:B009VKSVEW Evecase® Premium Flip Cover Leather Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 2]] - since they are both made by the same company.

I know it is slightly more than my past range, but I finally wanted a phone that does more, but doesn't cost an arm and a leg.

I can't say enough how awesome the camera is.<br />- The battery life is amazing, my phone only lasted through the day if I didn't do anything. This phone lasts all day even with some gaming (1-2h).<br />- Basic Android with minimal bloatware<br />- I was able to transfer almost all my data with no issues or hick-ups<br />- There is a headphone jack - wahooo (I guess I'm old school,  but I like it)<br />- I love the fast charging option, never had it before and it is great getting 70% in 20min<br />- Super light and compact, I do appreciate the size and that this phone is smaller than my old<br /><br />Cons:<br />- no wireless charging<br /><br />I can't say much about material, the material seems to be the same as all my old phones.

1.0,problems over problems - do not buy,"Update #2<br /><br />Forget about it, just don't buy this phone. I had plenty of problems almost right from the start, but now it almost doesn't work anymore. The phone is really just junk now, it freezes all the time, apps crash on a daily (hourly basis), text messages only go out if I restart the phone (and not all the time either), it won't log into any wi-fi anymore, so all is now on data. I'm waiting for black friday and some deals, but once I get a new phone, I will take my car and drive over this one.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />Ok, sorry but I have to drop my rating by quite a lot, the phone turns out to be a pain in the backside. I had so many issues already and the tech support is really sad. They don't have anyone that would be able to assist with problems beyond the knowledge of the techs on the chat/phone. The latest issue is the icons being stuck after messages, downloads etc and I did all they told me to do, restart, empty cache and nothing helped. The tech had no more ideas and suggested a factory reset, I've done that before and I will not redo my whole phone again. Out of previous experience, it doesn't solve the issues the phone has. His next advice was to return the phone, well, that time passed too. I have to be honest, if amazon would allow me to return the phone, I'd go with a different brand and not buy Nokia again. I'm sad to say, this phone turned out to be a huge disappointment so far. If I hadn't paid so much money ($220 is a lot for me), I would just drive over it and buy myself something else. I think this brand could be great, might just take a couple of years and some more phones for them to figure out support and to resolve the many bugs they have. I was so excited in the first weeks, but every time you have a problem or find a bug, the same answer is, restart, empty cache and if that doesn't help, do the factory reset.<br /><br />---------------------------------<br />Ok, so I got this phone right when Amazon offered it on the market. I was always a huge fan of Nokia and even went with the Lumia while they were still working with MS on phones. I was so sad when they quit making phones and I stuck with the lumia line, which I'm sooo glad I can finally drop (not good phones, no support and only a pain to deal with). I was considering getting an android already last year, but when I heard that HMD is reviving the Nokia brand, I waited a whole year to see what they came up with. Granted, I had to put in some patience, since it took forever for them to get the phone on the US market. I was about to buckle and buy the new Motorola 5 series.<br /><br />The positive (coming from someone that had a low line lumia for a long time):<br />- camera, very nice and makes great pictures, I'm pretty sure there are better ones out there, but it's good for the price<br />- easy to use, not a lot of bloatware to delete<br />- great quality, it feels sturdy and well built<br />- huge storage to expand<br />- has dual sim in case you don't need to expand memory (kind of a negative too, it is one or the other, you can't have both)<br />- display is great and very clear even in sunlight<br /><br />Negative:<br />- no fast charging option<br />- the processor is very slow and I don't do much with my phone, but I noticed it<br />- there is no way to transfer your stuff from MS Lumia to Android, not sure if that is the phone's fault, but my hubby spent days researching and working on getting my stuff moved over<br />- there is no option to snooze your calendar entries, might be android calendar problem, but it's annoying<br />- there are not a lot of accessories to buy, hope there is more in the works. I got a case but it is super boring and bland<br />- tech support isn't very helpful with questions<br /><br />All in all, I'm very happy with it, I finally made the change over to Android and couldn't be happier.

5.0,My daughter loves this phone case and it’s so realistic,"I bought this phone cover for my adult daughter who has a Samsung Galaxy Note 10 phone.<br /><br />When it arrived, we were so pleased with the design and the quality.<br /><br />The case is easy for her to hold onto and has a nice grip to it. The edges are “bumpered” to help protect her phone when she inevitably drops it or it slides off her bed. The image is behind or in the actually plastic case…not just an obvious piece of paper laying in there.<br /><br />The matte finish of the case does not show fingerprints…so I’m jealous of that.<br /><br />You would think it’s an actual cassette tape if you didn’t notice the length difference. We find it helpful to keep the case side facing up when leaving the phone somewhere like a counter or bed. This way it stands out more and I can also tell it’s not my phone.<br /><br />She has had no trouble charging it on our wireless charging pad.<br /><br />I thought the price was very affordable and, since it’s easy to get the case on and off, she might order some other designs.",1674190390570,0,True

The dual USB ports on each are a nice bonus.<br /><br />She is thrilled with the colors and they worked perfectly when she tested on her phone.<br /><br />The price is certainly a good value for so many adapters and the quality is there.

5.0,Solid phone stand helps me stay connected to my world,"I work from home and I don’t want a lot of things cluttering up my desk. This phone stand is the best purchase I could have made to keep my phone upright and easy for me to view or access, while not taking up a lot of room. This is so much better than having my phone lay flat on the desk.<br /><br />This stand is sturdy and can be adjusted to most any angle you want. Again, so much easier for me to view the screen than having the phone lay flat.<br /><br />I especially like the rubber-lined base to keep the whole stand from moving around. Also the little feet you rest the phone on are rubberized…and the back inside surface. Not only does this keep my phone secure, but it is not noisy when I put it back on the stand each time. I often just reach over to tap the phone and it never moves, or I pick it up for more detailed use.<br /><br />AND… I can even put my tablet on this stand, if I want.<br /><br />I don’t personally use this feature, but there is an opening for a charging cable if needed.<br /><br />This stand will hold up well, is stylish in appearance, and I see no need for me to look for anything else…and I think it’s a great value.<br /><br />I have sent this out as Christmas gifts and sent one to my son’s house for me to use when I’m visiting.

(A few won't block the camera if your phone is tall enough, but it has to be huge)<br />It operates one hand, with spring action - no having to unscrew it every time or needing 2 hands to get it in and out or fiddling with rubber corner straps. (It is the ONLY spring action that also doesn't block camera.)<br />It fits my tiny phone. It is the ONLY spring loaded holder that fits an iphone 5 (and probably the iphone 12 mini too)<br />I tried dozens of holders. Nothing else worked for all three of my criteria: a small phone, one-hand quick operation AND didn't block camera.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I wish that it had a lock because I take it offroad on bumpy terrain.<br />I recommend putting a rubber sticky-back non-slip pad where the back of the phone hits for extra security if you mountain bike.<br />I also added a little grip in the top clip. My phone is TINY though.<br />The clamp that holds it to the handlebar works great but is bigger and bulkier than it needs to be, however it is a typical ball joint connection used in most phone holders and I happened to have another that I swapped.",1621474473048,0,True

This one also had a a quick release button unlike the other.<br /><br />Two issues here, one is the clearance to get a bottom power cord between the two pegs is incredibly tight. Second issue is the quick release button is behind those two pegs. If you mount this on the vent so that it is secure, the thing is resting on the button making it virtually impossible to hit the button without ruining the positioning/security of the whole thing.<br /><br />An additional issue with mine which is perhaps just a defect is that the quick release button isn't well, quickly releasing to the whole width. You can hold that baby for a long time before it opens the whole way.  And since it is nearly impossible to get to button when it is mounted you can see why it tried my patience long enough.<br /><br />UPDATE: I won't be getting another phone for a long time and even though it has been awhile the vendor offered me a refund since this is not working with my current phone.",1438688370000,2,True
3.0,Don't want to return but magnet causing issue with phone,"I had high hopes for this mount and although the product appears good quality the magnet is not compatible with my phone at least. I have a Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 Duos. It is not a phablet but with even a thin case on it the stretch for the cradle type mounts requires too much effort and scary pushing/squishing/flexing of the phone. I thought this was the answer to my prayers.<br /><br />It was packaged nicely and all parts were fine. Does seem like a quality product. I put one of the metal plates between the rubberized case and the phone's case, high middle of the back. The phone went to sleep. I turned it on with a touch on home button and the screen was kerfluffled. It was all black except for a music note symbol, some other symbols and the time. No response to any screen touches. I had to power off and reboot without magnet to back home screen.<br /><br />I experimented with different places of plate/magnet. If I went lower I would get a popup saying I was using an unknown network and might incur charges, huh?<br /><br />So, I need to give up. Your mileage will vary. I can say as far as this model of phone I would steer clear of the magnets. Has nothing to do with mfr or vendor I am sure, it is just the magnetic field type of connection that is not compatible with my particular phone.  So I figure the fair thing to do is give it a medium rating. There is nothing I can see wrong with it but my phone doesn't like it.",1437432811000,7,True
4.0,Served(ing) me well,"I bought this phone a little more than a year ago off of a popular internet auction site that shall remain nameless. As occasionally happens there, I got an uncommunicative seller who shipped in very very poor packaging ending with me with a loose phone/battery and box in another box but the phone appear(s)ed to be working okay.<br /><br />I bought this phone as a locked AT&T phone but had already done my homework/pricing to unlock it. As I use Consumer Cellular it did not really need to be unlocked to work with their network but I went ahead and purchased an unlock code and did it myself successfully. Please note unlocking is not the same as rooting. How I wish I could root this phone! It is not easy to do, and I even paid some folks for fixes and got my money back after they failed. So, unlock can be done. I have done it. Rooting is very difficult and should only be attempted by professional in the field.  I did need consumer cellular help to get it to hook up with their APN so I could get data. Took a few calls but I am OK.  Would hate to think what just another brand unlocked phone would be like to get going since technically, CC uses AT&T it should not have been this difficult.<br /><br />I bought this to wean off of a Blackberry. I had tried some waawee huawei whatever smartphone and hated the onscreen keyboard with a passion and the fact it was a little piece of junk.  I didn't have much faith in RIM and BB continuing but still wanted a physical keyboard so this fit the bill.  I agree that while the pull out keyboard is nice, it is not really that easy to type on.  Gradually over the year I have been using the onscreen misery more just because that has the autocorrect. It is a nice option to have a real keyboard so enjoy while you can.<br /><br />Besides the issue with getting this phone to accept another APN (even though it was unlocked) the Samsung issues are as follows:<br /><br />1) Yes the battery life sucks.  Sometimes if I come home and forget to hook it to power for overnight it is dead dead dead in the morning.  Just resign yourself to giving it a good charge at the minimum once a day/night.<br /><br />2) GPS flaw.  Two issues there actually.  One is the darn thing won't lock and will just drain your battery when you turn it on for an app that requires it. It requires a reboot for the GPS to lock if the phone has not been rebooted in a day or two. Second is it is so bad it can just overheat/shutdown the phone even if it did lock.<br /><br />3) External memory micro SD problem. This is reportedly an issue with a) all androids or b) all samsungs or c) counterfeit cards. Pick one.  I replaced the teeny 2GB that came with my Glide with a Kingston 32GB class 4 card. I had issues with the apps that were moved to SD disappearing but nothing a reboot or reinstall of app would not fix until yesterday when the phone got hot as the surface of the sun and gave me the dire message of damaged SD card after I rebooted to get the GPS working (yes, do not depend on this phone in a pinch, please don't).<br /><br />The card is dead as in doornail not recognized by this or any device or able to hold formatting. Getting warranty replacement on the card but beware if you want to upgrade.  I have no advice after reading so many conflicting accounts about just what is the problem with Android or Samsung and external cards. Apparently these days it is no longer common to even have capability for an external card on a droid so leads me to believe it is an OS thing.<br /><br />As a phone.  Call quality is less than stellar if you ask me.  But I am mostly in marginal areas and have not had an issue in fantastic signal areas.<br /><br />Data - accept that in good signal areas with hyperband whathave you when it will forget it is unlocked it seems to be fine.  If it forgets it is unlocked in some special AT&T service area it requires turning data on/off again to do the other APN thing again.<br /><br />Camera - very nice.  Haven't used the front much, I don't want to see me any more than anybody else would want to.<br /><br />You can see here this phone has required me to do more technical stuff than I care to. It is nice to have a keyboard, camera is very good and it has not dropped dead on me so giving it four stars rather than three.",1400680424000,0,False
5.0,Nice for the price,"PLEASE SEE  UPDATE/CORRECTIONS  I was pleasantly surprised.  I am still not sure if I like my Captivate in this color but this definitely a nice case. It does not interfere with the keyboard at all, and fit perfectly.  It is worth the money.  I would be paying twice the price for it or anything but for this price, a nice deal.  The shipping was very fast from eForCity (NO apparently purchase was not eforcity and it was good see later comments) and it was just a padded envelope but really, this is just a little bit of plastic, who needs more packaging?  Oh, I just happened to have cut myself quite badly earlier in the day and well, had a bandaid that was not holding back the tide anymore. To make a long story short, got blood on the case as I was putting it on the phone and figured well that was the end of that, but hey, blood wiped right off with a little windex.  Not too shabby.  At this price I might order a second to have on hand but still have to think about how I like my phone White.<br /><br />Well, after two days, I noticed the white phone I now loved had awful black streaks.  They were being caused by my walmart purse lining.  Oh well, nothing I tried in the way of cleaners took them off so I was determined to find a new purse or line the old purse with something white because I LOVED my phone in the white case.  Well, I decided to line the purse with some white interface iron stuff but in the meantime ordered two more white cases.  Well, I thought I ordered the from the same place, same case,etc.  Was badly disappointed.  The vendor for eforcity case, err, EFORCITY, sent me two pieces of garbage.  They were stiff, cheap, brittle, rough edge plastic that did not fit my phone and had different cutouts from the previous rubberized case I loved.  I emailed them, showed them pics and did get a refund.  However, I am still left with just my poor black streaked eforcity white rubberized case now.  Going to try mr clean magic eraser on it this weekend.  Darn, I LOVE this case and didn't want anything to happen to it.<br /><br />But BEWARE, if your case doesn't have a great big cutout for  camera/flash/speaker instead of a tiny hole, it is hard plastic that is inferior to this excellent rubberized stuff with a custom fit. Accept no substitutions.<br /><br />More UPDATE: which I should have done before this.  OK, some items you have to be careful of when you order if you really liked the last order that you are ordering from the same vendor.  I did so love this white case.  Unfortunately, my cheap wallyworld purse lining stained the heck out of it to black grimy dirty that apparently nothing can clean. No, Mr clean magic erasers didn't work either.  I was distraught.  Looked into other purses and lining the current black one to keep my phone case, WHITE.  Well, in the meantime I ordered two more of what I THOUGHT was the same case, right from here, the link to the original one ordered.  Anyhow, long story short, I had to go to another website/search engine to find what I originally bought here.  And yes, if you find the big hole one it is the genuine article and will fit your captivate fine.  Just be very careful of where you put it, even a dark denim pocket in your jeans, etc is likely to stain it.  A shame, it is a wonderful case, so nice in white but too easy to stain.",1369009996000,1,True

5.0,Nothing fishy here,"This is an awesome little toy for your iPhone 5, but obviously with limitations - you can't expect Carl Zeiss technology for this price after all.<br /><br />You get a fisheye lens, a wide angle lens and a macro lens in a device the width of your phone.  To access the macro lens you need to unscrew the wide angle lens. It comes with lens caps and a drawstring carrying case.<br /><br />Limitations include:<br />1. You can't have a protective screen on your phone as the fit is THAT snug<br />2. No flash when using this attachment<br />3. You need to take it off when calls come in<br />4. You need a very steady hand to get crisp macro images, and you need to be thiscloseupto your subject<br />5. The lens caps have a mind of their own and disappear into thin air.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's portable and quick to attach, and comes in very handy when taking architectural photos or landscapes to send to friends or post online.

4.0,Worthwhile investment,"This is a very sturdy screen protector that fits neatly over the face of an iPhone 5 and then virtually disappears. The touch screen remains completely accessible, and you won't even know the protector is there until the phone takes a tumble and survives.<br /><br />The package also includes a wet wipe for cleaning the screen to prep it for installation, a small microfiber cloth, a plastic squeegee for removing air bubbles and two aluminium buttons (one black and one silver) for covering the home button. (The screen protector doesn't cover the home button, leaving it in a slight depression, so these buttons are to fill the space and cheer it up)<br /><br />You'll need to be careful when aligning the protector during installation, as you don't get a second chance to get it right without causing air bubbles or discoloration that the squeegee can't get out. The instructions are very easy - it's the steady hand required to line it up that causes problems.<br /><br />If you're going to use the aluminium button to cover the home button, place it before applying the protective screen, which makes everything easier to align.  I found that the sensitivity of the home button was reduced, and getting it off again is very difficult without messing up the protector, so test it first before applying the screen.<br /><br />My only problem is that even though it's not very thick, that extra layer prevents me from using my three-in-one photo lens attachment, which I use regularly, being a photo-fanatic.<br /><br />A wonderful investment to protect your expensive phone from cracks and scratches, but the extra thickness may cause some problems with accessories.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 4, 2013",1380917171000,0,False
4.0,"The new ""Little Mermaid""","From Hayao Miyazaki, the master of Japanese animation, comes a story similar to The Little Mermaid, where a small and ever-so-cute fish-like female becomes infatuated with a land dwelling male, and moves heaven and earth, and a lot of ocean to try to make her dream come true.<br /><br />Short attention span summary (SASS):<br /><br />1. Fish girl lives with her father and siblings in an aquarium-like home inside a really cool submarine with flippers.<br />2. Headstrong and clever, she sneaks out to see the surface, and encounters the debris of human civilization, immediately getting into trouble.<br />3.

Everything goes topsy-turvy until her mother shows up<br /><br />Ponyo is a wonderfully entertaining movie for young children, and although not as strong in plot as Miyazaki's other movies like Princess Mononoke or Howl's Moving Castle, the animation is excellent, and the story will touch your heart.<br /><br />There is no shortage of voice talent, with Noah Cyrus (Miley's little sister) as Ponyo, Frankie (the bonus) Jonas as her friend Sosuke, and also Tina Fey, Matt Damon, Liam Neeson, Cate Blanchett, Cloris Leachman, Betty White and Lily Tomlin.<br /><br />This is one to see with the entire family, but falls just short of perfect with a few too many inexplicable elements.

That's it!<br /><br />Of course, any old phone will do that, but there's my image to look out for, so I also want it to look expensive and sleek, to be able to pick up signals even in office blocks, have long battery life, and have tons of cool features to talk about, even if I never use them.  The ability to withstand sudden impacts and the occasional passing shower is also an asset.<br /><br />So far, this phone has met all my needs as follows:<br /><br />(1) It makes calls just great<br />(2) It receives calls clearly<br />(3) It looks trendy with its cute little handle-shaped antenna, which is very useful as a handle when pulling it from your bag<br />(4) It's not the most expensive, but it looks like a million bucks<br />(5) It picks up signals in office buildings (and elsewhere)<br />(6) Excellent battery life<br />(7) It fell and survived  (JAN 16 - EDIT: IT FELL AGAIN AND THE INTERIOR DISPLAY IS DAMAGED. THE PHONE HOWEVER STILL WORKS)<br />(8) It got drizzled on and survived<br /><br />Feature wise:<br /><br />(1) It has a camera and can take video recordings<br />(2) You can set up speed dialing fairly easily<br />(3) It has flashing lights when it rings, and you can change the light shows (or turn the darn thing off already)<br />(4) Lots of memory for lots of numbers, e-mail addresses, birthdays and so on<br />(5) You can set different lights and ring tones for each one of your friends<br />(6) You can show a different photo on the display outside to the one inside.<br />(7) It has a stopwatch and calculator<br />(8) It has a loud speaker!

(It's got Bluetooth and infra-red for transferring data - but don't ask me how to use them - I just like saying that I have it)<br />(15) Lots of shortcut keys to get to things quickly<br />(16) Internet services (I can't use these yet, because my provider doesn't offer it)<br />(17) it has a very nice alarm clock feature<br /><br />Things not so great about it:<br /><br />(1) The position of the camera button is bad for me.  I use a Body Glove case, and when I pull out the phone, I sometimes inadvertently take a picture on the way out.  Similarly when trying to open it in a hurry.<br />(2) The picture quality isn't the best<br />(3) It's not easy to open with one hand<br />(4) While the volume buttons are conveniently placed on the side, I sometimes hit them when answering a call.<br />(5) The sound is kinda tinny<br />(6) Not enough cool ring tones (yeah, I can get more, but using Bluetooth means I have to read the manual)<br />(7) You have to remember to use the arrow keys to get to other tabs in the menus to see all the features<br />(8) Speed dialing needs two buttons (I'm accustomed to holding down one button)<br />(9) The lights go out really quickly before you can finish deciding what you're looking for<br /><br />Overall, a great phone for the price, and it looks good too.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, January 10, 2006",1136870628000,42,False

5.0,I don't think you'll find a better screen protector for the Galaxy Note II,"This is a 5-star product.  To start with, the instructions are excellent.  The written instructions are very good, but what's even better is that they also offer a two minute video instruction which clearly demonstrates how to install the screen protector on your phone.  Between the written and video instructions, you'll have a flawless bubble-free installation.  Perhaps best of all, the end of the instructions say something like: &#34;Don't worry if it doesn't turn out right. Call us and we'll try to help in any way we can.  And this product has a lifetime guarantee, so we'll send you another set of screen protectors if you mess up the first batch.&#34;  What else can you ask for?  Customer service doesn't get much better than that.<br /><br />After installing the screen protector, Galaxy Note touch screen response and S-pen work perfectly.  And the protector is crystal clear.  It does not detract from the Galaxy Note experience at all.<br /><br />Consider using these screen protectors with the OtterBox Commuter case (which comes with a screen protector that is not as good as the iSmooth).<br /><br />Finally, included with the 3 screen protectors and lint removal stickers, is a large high-quality microfiber cleaning cloth. The cleaning cloth alone makes the purchase a positive.",1361927183000,0,True

5.0,This is the best case for the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (I prefer it even over the OtterBox Commuter),"After reading many reviews on the OtterBox cases, I initially ordered an OtterBox Commuter because a lot people were complaining about the Defender's added bulk and the screen protector getting dusty.<br /><br />The OtterBox Commuter is an excellent case, no question about it. But for me, there was one problem: the Galaxy Note 2 in an OtterBox Commuter is still too big to fit comfortably in your pocket. In fact, you're going to eventually wear a hole in most pants if you keep your Galaxy Note 2 Commuter in your pocket all day (the corners of the case rub and stretch the fabric when you're sitting down, and digging the phone in and out of your pocket all day puts stress on the pocket seams as well).<br /><br />So I ordered an OtterBox Defender to try out. Having used both, I prefer the OtterBox Defender over the Commuter. The Defender's outer shell has a nicer grip that feels better and more secure in your hand. The built-in screen protector has not been an issue (I was worried about it after reading some other people's reviews, but so far I have no complaints about dust or its usability). And the Defender's belt clip allows you to wear the phone on your belt instead of in your pocket. Granted, phone belt clips are not ideal but it's better than ruining your expensive dress work pants. Also, the Defender belt clip is very high quality and it positions the phone flat against your side so it's not that bad looking.<br /><br />In terms of added bulk, the Defender is really not much larger than the Commuter (certainly less of a difference than I was expecting).<br /><br />Finally, the Defender does offer more rugged protection than the Commuter - although the Commuter is probably more than adequate protection for most normal situations.<br /><br />Overall, I really like the OtterBox Defender case and am very happy with it.",1360285828000,1,True

1.0,disappointing!!!,"This is probably the worse phone I have ever had.  It is not user friendly at all. I have not downloaded many apps and do not use many apps. I don't use the bluetooth and only use data when I have wifi access.  I know this is not the galaxy 111 but based on the high ratings on Samsung phones I really expected better performance.  I just switched from a blackberry, but this is really disappointing.  Not even the basic features like making a call works well.  Its just two months and I really cannot put up with this for much longer.  Think I will go Iphone.<br /><br />Pros:  Nice size phone- attractive.<br /><br />cons:  The buttons on either side of the centre menu buttons do not light up and takes very long to respond when pressed.<br />  There is no way to cut off or end a call other than waiting until the touch screen pops up with the end button which takes quite a while after you have dialed - this has resulted in the<br />  person on the other end hearing me for at least 15 seconds after I think I have ended the calls.<br /><br />  Battery life started out really great for the 1st three weeks or so giving me at least 2 days without charging using wifi and apps.  Now - about 2 weeks later its down to less than a<br />  day- I have to charge daily.<br /><br />  The dual sim does not allow you to  pick which sim to call from - it has to be set on 1 at a time and to change you have to go to the settings options and change it.  I had dual sim phones before and when you dialed a number there was an option to choose which sim to dial from.  For incoming calls it automatically diverts the calls from the sim which is not set, to the sim which is set without the callers knowing that their call is going to another carrier.<br /><br />Difficult to store numbers in the phone book - in fact from time to time I am unable to access some numbers which I know were stored and I did not delete.<br /> contacts which were automatically stored as SNS cannot be edited.<br /><br />Sometimes you dial a number, and press call- it just diverts back to the main menu- this happens regularly now.<br /><br />The list goes on.....<br /><br />I definitely will not recommend this phone.",1365086420000,17,True

The only problem is that this phone does NOT come with a SIM card.  It is very easy to transfer data ( contacts, videos, pictures, calendar, settings, etc) from the old phone to the new phone. You connect USB point to each phone, in a minute or two it's finished.  After all data transferred, wifi password entered and all settings were identical to his &#34;old&#34; phone. However,  new phone it would not connect to wifi.  Why?  Because there was no SIM card included with the phone.  Had to go to Verizon store to buy a sim card - only $16.  They installed the card  and they activated the phone, thus  disables your old phone.  Be sure to get the glass protector.!!!  This design of phone  uses &#34;liquid glass&#34; - literally, its a vile of liquid you purchase and Verizon rubs the liquid on the glass face of the phone display in 3 quick steps  This liquid glass costs $52 with tax, but otherwise the display will crack if you drop it.

5.0,"Simple, basic protection",I love my Pixel 7 Pro even more than I loved my Pixel 4. The camera bar across the back of this phone means you must have a case of some sort. This one fits properly and doesn't interfere with the power or volume buttons in normal use.,1670361381756,0,False

5.0,"Fits perfectly, looks good","I have this case in burgundy and it's quite attractive. It has the raised edges to protect the screen and on the back surrounding the cameras.

3.0,Not great,"The fingerprint reader area is entirely non-functional with this on. Additionally, the bottom corners are loose and a simple tap of the finger doesn't connect to the screen.

4.0,"Thick, decent protection","My new Note 20 is my work phone.

5.0,Fits Pixel 4a 5g,"I absolutely love my Pixel phone and I intend to keep it a long time. Unfortunately, I'm also a klutz.

4.0,"Bright, useful light.","I love a solar light for overnight horse trips and as an emergency backup in the RV. This one is very simple and easy to use.<br /><br />The light is very bright and direct when on full. Dimming it still provides plenty of light to walk around in or do basic stuff.

5.0,Fits properly,"My other case was too thick and causing my phone to heat up when used outside. It was driving me nuts. This one seems to be better.<br /><br />It's soft, but still sturdy and offers protection for the phone's corner edges.

It's a good case.",1621387686317,0,False
5.0,Works very well,"This is a very handy gadget for us desert dwellers. The solar power aspect is especially reassuring since we are in a very remote area.<br /><br />The light is seriously bright. We lit up half of the travel trailer with just this light. It was sufficient for cooking and eating. You can totally read by this light as well.<br /><br />As a camping lantern, this is super useful. You can use it as a solar battery charger for phones or a Kindle. They do charge slowly, but better than nothing out in the back country.",1620535516004,0,False
2.0,Hampers the fingerprint sensor.  Looks cheap,"Cheap vinyl.  That's the first thing I think every time I look at this case. It feels like cheap vinyl as well. It fits the phone,  but the fingerprint sensor has gone haywire with this case n. Its interfering somehow and that drives me nuts. I've gone back to just using a reinforced bumper case instead of this.",1614630471665,0,False
3.0,Notch at top makes no sense,"I expect better from Otterbox. Period. The glass does fit my Google Pixel 4a 5g phone and it is protecting my screen. The installation method using the frame is genius. It allows you to put the glass on in the simplest way without any problems. I have zero bubbles and everything was finished in seconds.<br /><br />However, the actual screen protector is not really designed for THIS PHONE. There's a random notch in the top center that doesn't correspond to anything on the physical phone. It looks terrible and makes no sense. If I hadn't already broken my previous screen protector, I would never have bothered to install this one.",1612530960845,0,False
3.0,"Too tight, bumps the volume buttons","This case isn't exactly as it appears on the listing photos. It has a clear back in a separate frame - not a glass/screen protector for the front in that second frame.<br /><br />It fits, but barely. Everything is so tight that it bumps the volume buttons and that drives me nuts. Getting the case off is difficult to say the least. I won't ever use this case - there are a lot of others that are just better.",1611365354637,1,False
5.0,Fits exactly,My husband has been using this case for a month or so now. He really likes it. His phone feels secure in his hands and not slippery.

5.0,"Bubble free, perfect clarity","My husband and I recently switched out our LG phones for new Pixel 4a 5G phones - excellent decision by the way. These screen protectors are a must have. They fit the phones perfectly and don't leave any part of the screen exposed. I did have 2 bubbles when I first put the protector on my phone, but 6 days later the bubbles are completely gone. After 3 weeks,  both phones look great and the protectors on both are bubble free. There is zero interference with the screen clarity or responsiveness.",1607461348299,0,True
5.0,Nice case,"I like this case more than I expected. It has a smooth feel, but isn't slippery to the hold. It fits perfectly and the volume and power buttons work correctly. I like the sort of tropical shade of blue as well - easy to see in my purse.",1607217847679,0,False
5.0,"Fits perfectly, easy to grip","We upgraded our 2 year old LG phones to the Pixel 4a 5g phones this week. Of course, everything has to change with a new phone.

5.0,No excess vibration on the go,"We installed this on our Kia Soul dash and it takes up less space than expected.  After two weeks, it is still stuck in place and holding well.

Hopefully,  it will survive the entire Texas summer.",1595293175041,0,False
4.0,Works well with an LG V40,"This is handy for watching a video or doing a video chat call. The stand is stable on a completely flat surface like a table. My LG V40 phone fits well and is visible at all angles. If you've got a larger phone, this stand might be too small to balance correctly.",1594320825984,0,False
4.0,Spares for a visitor with an iPhone,"My mother is literally the person we know who owns any Apple products at all. She's also the person who never remembers to bring a charger when she travels. Of course, none of the chargers for our Samsung,  LG or Fire products will charge her iPhone. I think we've finally cured this nonsense.  She brought her cables, but not the charger this week and I was able to use these. They seem to work just fine. Her phone didn't get hot and charged with no issues.",1593307248913,0,False
5.0,Fits properly and comfortable to hold,This case is nice. It fits the Stylo 4 perfectly and all the exterior buttons are fully accessible. The fingerprint reader and camera are clear and unobstructed. Its comfortable to hold as well and not so hard that it feels like a brick.,1582392342723,0,True
3.0,Huge bubbles and does not cover entire screen,"I love my new View 2 tablet, but it doesn't come with a screen protector and with 17 inches of glass, that's a potential disaster. This unit was the only one I could find that was actual glass and not just plastic. Unfortunately, this protector is not great. I mean, it works,  but there's a lot of room improvement.<br /><br />This protector does not  cover the entire screen. There's a substantial border wall the way around, at the edges that is just uncovered. The package has no directions included and doesn't come with a smoothing edge for bubbles. And there huge bubbles no matter how you put it on the tablet. At over twenty bucks, this is a terrible value. I'm going to keep looking for a better screen protector.",1578770397462,0,True
5.0,Charges correctly with no heat,"I have a couple of these wireless type chargers from different brands and have had to stop using two of them due to heat. This one is much better in both quality and performance. It's sturdy without being heavy and it just stays put. I like that you put the phone on it upright so you can actually use it if you need to.<br /><br />I'm using this with an LG V40 phone and it charges very quickly. My phone didn't get hot even charging from 20% to 100% last night. The charger wasn't hot either. All in all, this one of those things you are better off getting from a major, name brand like Samsung.",1575482841623,0,False
4.0,Actually does fast charging,"Personally, I don't care for the little decorations on this cable, but that's just me and it doesn't have any bearing on the cord's functionality. I'm using this with a surge protector rather than directly in an outlet connection. That can cause some cables to charge more slowly than they should. Happily, that isn't the case here. My LG V40 phone shows the fast charge notice when I use this cord and it's definitely faster than a different one we use.",1575144113150,0,False
4.0,Working pretty well in a semi truck,"My husband has used this headset for a couple of weeks now in the semi. It fits him well and is pretty adjustable. The microphone adjusts enough to get out of the way and not aggravate him. He says the ear piece is decently padded and doesn't give him cauliflower ear, but it can get hot after awhile.<br /><br />The sound is pretty good overall. He hears the caller clearly with no interference. I can hear him when he calls, but there's a fair amount of background noise if he's in the big truck. Still, it functions like it should and he's not complaining about it.",1570634174689,5,False
4.0,Zero to wobbly two bars in the middle of literal nowhere,"It took a few weeks before we were able to install this and actually test it. We have a family ranch in deep West Texas along the Rio Grande and about 3 hours from the nearest town. That means cellular reception is sketchy on a good day and nonexistent on most days. I've literally had to drive 50 miles to get a full bar on too many occasions to think about. As a precaution against emergencies or criminal trespassers requiring law enforcement, we carry a satellite phone down there. That works well, but can get very expensive very quickly.<br /><br />My husband and friend installed this booster system on the big farm truck and horse trailer so we can use it when we're hauling horses to shows or the ranch and at the ranch. They both did serious amounts of cursing and carrying on getting everything put together and it took two hours. I made a point to be elsewhere until it was done.<br /><br />We were able to upgrade our one bar (AT&T only) on two LG cellphones to 3 bars at the hilltop 50 miles before the ranch. That's a significant improvement because the old one bar was mostly voice only - data was molasses slow. I was able to send and receive email on my phone like I can in big cities.<br /><br />Once we got off the paved road and into the Chisos Mountains heading into the ranch, we lost all connection like normal. I was able to get two bars standing on top of the horse trailer at the actual house which sits on a mesa overlooking the Rio Grande and Mexico. I'm pretty pleased - I can make calls from the house without the satellite phone or the 50 miles trek. We still need the sat phone on horses and in the back country, but that's fine.",1568577380735,5,False
4.0,Fit is comfortable and it sounds clear on both ends,"My husband is using this headset for video calls on his laptop when he's on the road. It's small enough to store easily in the big rig truck until he needs it. He says it's reasonably comfortable for the short periods he has to wear it....no pinching or pulling his hair. It's also simple to use. On the other end of the call, I don't hear a lot of background noise when we talk while he uses this. For our purposes, this works fine.",1565545462024,0,False
5.0,Fast charging for an LG phone,I had another one of these that I loved in my car for a year and my husband swiped it. This one is my replacement. It fits correctly and works perfectly in both a F150 truck and a Kia Soul. I'm using it with an LG V40 phone and it pops up the fast charging message. I've also used it to charge a tablet and it does fine. The charger doesn't get hot and I expect another year of solid performance like the old one had.,1563648513508,0,False
5.0,"Nice looking, fits correctly",Fits my LG V40 perfectly. All of the buttons are fully functional and fit in the cutouts fine. The case doesn't interfere with the camera or fingerprint scanner. There's just enough lip to offer a bit of protection to the front of the phone as well.,1563127803621,5,True
5.0,Two weeks and zero problems with LG V40 phone,"I love wireless chargers for my phone and have several of them including one in my truck. I'm using this charger with my LG V40 phone and it's working very well without any problems. It does take three seconds for the phone to ding its ""charging"" message after I put it on the stand. However, I haven't had to shift the phone around to find a sweet spot - I just set it on the stand and it charges even with the case. Like with any of the wireless pads, this one can cause some heat build up on the phone as it charges.  This is not as fast as my corded dedicated fast charger, but it's not slow either. I like it.",1555357454071,0,False
3.0,Does not charge new Galaxy or LG V40,"I travel to deep West Texas often and we have an off grid cabin on the ranch so charging a tablet or cell phone has to be done in the truck. Having a portable solar charger has always appealed to me. This one is small and can be used on the porch of the cabin or even while hiking.<br /><br />However, it does not work with every phone or either of our tablets. My new LG V40 and a Samsung Galaxy Note don't charge with this - nor do our 2 year old Samsung tablets. It did work with a 5 year old Sony Xperia phone, but the charging is super slow. So this will work in a pinch in a limited manner, but not with every device.",1551711510352,2,False
5.0,"Fits perfectly, grippy and doesn't interfere with the phone buttons or camera","This fits our old S8 perfectly. It's just a backup phone and doesn't get used often, but because it's smaller and more slippery than our LG V40 phones, it's much easier to drop. This case pops on and stays put like it should. The side buttons are fully functional through the case and it's very easy to hold.",1547054390081,0,False
4.0,"Fits perfectly, doesn't interfere with the stylus","My husband has a history of dropping phones so an OtterBox case is always a must when he gets a new phone. They have literally saved two of his phones over the years after being dropped from the roof once and down a trail in West Texas.<br /><br />This one fits his new LG Stylo 4 plus exactly as it should and all the buttons are fully functional even with both pieces on the phone. The case has an interior rubber case and a hard shell outer case and has the little flaps that cover the earphone jack and charger jack, but still leaves the stylus easily accessible.<br /><br />Using both pieces adds considerable bulk to an otherwise very soon phone.

2.0,Suction cups failing after 300 miles Unnecessarily complicated to put together.,"Edit UPDATE - He drove 300 miles and the adhesive is already coming loose on the end pieces. The entire unit is coming off and the suction cups aren't holding at all to the dash now. So essentially, after 2 full days being installed and just one day on the road in semi truck, this thing has already begun to fall.<br /><br />*****Original review below*****<br />My husband needed a better holder for his cellphone and small GPS unit when he's on the road in the semi truck. This rack is sturdier than it first appears coming out of the box n a million pieces. This thing requires total assembly and frankly, I found that more than a little obnoxious. Several of these small pieces could be shipped installed and essentially ready to use since it's already in a large box. The end foot pieces could certainly be attached to the pole before the customer gets it, cutting down significantly on the number of small pieces to keep track of.<br /><br />Once we got it together, the magnetic holder for the phone was easy enough to place and adjust for location. The set includes the adhesive and metal piece to attach to your phone case so it just snaps onto the holder via magnets. There are little feet that extend down to help balance the phone if you have a really big one.<br /><br />The suction cups to attach the entire contraption to the truck dash are reasonably tough and hold on well enough on the flat top dash area. This bar is flexible and can bend, but trying to attach the suction cups to the slightly uneven surface adjacent to radio panel didn't work. It'll take a few thousand miles in the big rig to find out exactly how sturdy this rack is and if it can stand up to the rigors of actual OTR truck driving.",1533061639461,2,False
3.0,"Doesn't sync with Audible, laggy and slow. Works best with five bar cell signal","I saw an article with this gadget mentioned and had to try it. I'm a nut for Alexa and having her in my truck is something I have looked forward to for a long time. Unfortunately, the Roav just isn't ready for the way I use Alexa.<br /><br />I talk to her and use her for adding things to my calendar, remembering specific information, operating my lights, playing music and primarily my audiobooks. This unit has been almost impossible to use with Audible. It doesn't sync my audiobooks and stutters badly when it does play. Half the time I just give up and play it directly through my SYNC Bluetooth system in my truck. The ROAV is no better with music going down the road.<br /><br />My other issue is for the ridiculous lag time. It typically takes ten seconds for Alexa to respond to any questions and often takes significantly longer. Today I actually timed it. I asked her what time it was at 9:57am. At 9:59m, she finally told me it was 9:57am.<br />If you have a solid bars of cellular service it's fine. However, the minute you drop to three bars or less, Alexa looses her ability to function and the entire thing stops. If you're only driving around a big city, you may never see any problems.

5.0,"Snappy performance, beautiful images, great battery. Love the high end camera","After two plus years with my beloved LG V10 phone, it was finally time to move on to a new phone with some improved features. I had been considering this phone and the new LG V30, but decided I didn't want another carrier locked phone with all the bloat ware buried in it. Nor was I interested in a price tag upwards of six hundred dollars - new phones have gotten obscenely expensive. However, after two weeks of use, this Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra is a bargain for several reasons.<br /><br />The six inch screen is not only a pleasure to use, it's simply gorgeous. The clarity and colors are outstanding. Watching a true HD show on the phone is as pretty as watching it on out big TV. I use two hands to type or surf the web because I am using a flip case on the phone. I have literally tried five different screen protectors and none of them fit. The curved sides mean a glass protector just doesn't cover the entire screen - I had to resort to a wallet style case to provide a bit of cover over the screen.<br /><br /> The camera is really a joy to use. It has an option for moving stills and super fast shutter for action shots - love this when I'm photographing the horses. The details on close ups are equally great - you can see every hair on our fluffed up Siamese cat.<br /><br />It only comes with 32gig of memory so you definitely need a beefy micro SD card if you take a ton of photos. I simply moved my 64gig card from my old phone and I was good to go. Everything transferred and populated the new phone. Because this is unlocked and I didn't owe anything on my old phone, I swapped my SIM card from the old phone to this one and was making/receiving calls and texts within minutes. We use AT&amp;T and I had zero drama swapping my phones out.<br /><br />I've been very pleased with the battery life here. My old LG had a removable battery and I was changing batteries or recharging at least once a day. This Xperia has gone from 6 am to around 10pm every day for 6 days straight without needing to be charged. I do most of my email, make calls, text a ton, print stuff, use the Audible app for books and take multiple photos daily - I basically use my phone instead of a tablet or laptop most of the day. The last two nights when I've finally charged it at bedtime, the battery was at 52% and 48%. I don't worry about it going dead if I'm having an extra long day. Honestly, I've just fallen in love with this phone and I will never go back to a carrier locked phone in the future.",1520791389492,15,False

5.0,"Fast responses, incredible battery, water and dust resistant. Screen protector built in","After 18 months of hard use, my husband's Sony Xperia phone needs to be retired. He travels overseas into some harsh environments for work and all over the US. His phone is constantly getting banged around, tossed in luggage, exposed to high heat, cold, damp and blowing sand. We've tried every case on the market and the only thing that is reliable are the heavy duty Otterboxes, but they add bulk and reduce the touch screen capacity - especially with gloves in winter. When I saw this CAT phone, I knew he needed to give it a try.<br /><br />It's fully ruggedized and water proof. The specs indicate that it can take a drop, extreme temperatures, sand and water exposure. The phone is essentially built into its own Otterboxes style case, including a permanent screen protector. No more bubbles! All of the ports - charging, ear phone and sim card & memory card slots are sealable. This adds bulk to the phone, of course, but it's not a big deal. A reasonable trade-off for protection you don't have to fiddle with.<br /><br />The screen is clear and very responsive, even with thin gloves on. The colors on videos are sharp and true. (See photos - the horse and rider are Edward Gal on Glock Voice in Europe) Calls are clear for both sides, though the volume could be a bit higher for windy conditions. This phone is certified for use with multiple hearing aids if needed. Surfing the internet via both WiFi and our AT&T cellular connection is snappy and stutter free because there's relatively little bloat ware preinstalled since this is an unlocked phone. We have a couple of games on it - Bejeweled, Angry Birds and Solitaire and all work smoothly with no stumbling. Watching YouTube videos is also fast and trouble free. The enormous battery boggles the mind when compared to the old Sony phone - watching twenty minutes of videos, playing Bejeweled (notorious battery hog) for ten minutes and sending texts only reduced the battery from 98% to 90%.<br /><br />My only complaint is the camera quality. It takes decent photos, but the old Xperia phone had an amazing camera, so decent is a bit of a let down. The pictures are fine for just quick snaps of the dogs being cute or a selfie, but if you want to take beautiful family pics, this camera probably isn't the best choice.  All the other features far outweigh this small issue for us though. The battery size and ruggedized construction alone are enough to make my husband very happy with the CAT phone.",1513110923636,10,False

4.0,No degradation of clarity or responsiveness of the screen. Needs thought to install just right.,"There is a warning on the product page for these screen protectors about a fit issue. The slight curved sides of the face of the phone cause the the tempered glass screen shield to have to be slightly smaller than the actual phone screen. It simply cannot bend like the sides of the phone without cracking etc. Once you get this unit on your Xperia X, it does fit per the specs given and the front camera, speaker and notification alert light are all easily used and not blocked.<br /><br />My issue was getting it lined up just right - the inexact fit means you have think about the placement and if you don't get it right on the first try, you can end up with a bubble or crooked corner. Fortunately, there are two screen protectors in the package and two sets of the application stickers. Once it's on there isn't a noticeable degradation of screen clarity or responsiveness and it has stayed in placed with no movement for several days now.<br /><br />******** UPDATE August 18, 2016 ********<br /><br />We've had this screen protector on our phone for about 6 weeks now and use the phone every day.

4.0,"Excellent camera! Poor Wi-Fi reception, beautiful screen and solid form, less bloatware than usual.","I've been using this Sony Xperia X and comparing it side by side with my two month old LG V10 for almost a week now. The first and most obvious difference, of course, is the size - my LG is a 5.7&#34; screen and the Sony is a 5&#34; screen. On paper that seems obvious, but it's not so easy to picture until you actually see the two phones side by side. The good thing is the smaller 5&#34; screen slips easily into most pants pockets, but it also means that the beautiful clarity of the screen can't be as fully enjoyed as it might be on a larger size.<br /><br />The unlocked status of this phone meant my current AT&T SIM card was active immediately when I swapped it from my LG to the Sony and back - zero problems. The micro SD card was recognized immediately and is holding apps, games and photos as it should. I was expecting the unlocked version to have significantly less bloatware than the typical carrier purchased phone and while this does have less, it is not bloat free. There are a number of hard loaded Sony apps and things like Facebook and Spotify that you can't delete. (I realize most people want Facebook, but I am not one who wants it as a mandatory, intrusive app on my phone)<br /><br />In comparison to the LG V10 in performance - the LG runs faster with 3 or more apps going at once. For example, texting and watching a YouTube video and doing email at once on the LG is smooth and lag free. The Sony stutters and the YouTube video ended up buffering and had to be stopped when a flurry of texts came in. It took me awhile to figure out why, but I realized it is because the Sony doesn't hold a WiFi connection as well as the LG in the same room, side by side on the same network. My LG and my husband's Blu phone will both show full strength Wi-Fi signal and this phone next to them will show 2/3 strength. Same results in three different homes with three different routers and networks - it just doesn't have great reception.<br /><br />What I absolutely love about the Sony Xperia X is the camera and the Xperia movie builder app. Holy cow does this thing take pretty pictures! It is spectacular at outdoor nature shots and especially backlit shots in bright sunlight. Taking multiple action pictures of horses galloping and changing directions was very nice - 12 shots in a row and only one was blurry. The details and color it gets with flowers and animals are so good that I am taking this phone on vacation to a National Park in a couple of weeks specifically to use as a camera. (My LG V10 is going as my communication device) The built in movie builder app is just a cute little gizmo that takes your still shots & puts them to music and makes a video for you - I've had a ball with it and the horse pictures.<br /><br />The phone comes with a fast charging wall charger and it is quick. The Bluetooth connected easily with my Echo and a pair of generic headphones and my Ford Sync system. So far the battery life has been excellent and slightly better than on my LG. My bottom line is that this is a decent phone and an excellent camera, but in the final tally, I think the poor WiFi reception and laggy behavior with multiple functions running at once means that I won't be leaving my LG V10 and making the Sony X my daily phone.<br /><br />******  UPDATE August 5 2016. ******<br /><br />I added the Magic Jack app to this phone recently for use with our Magic Jack account when traveling overseas. It allows you to call the United States without incurring international roaming fees by using a Wi-Fi connection. In initial testing this week, it is working, but the weak Wi-Fi reception on this phone makes this function sketchy unless you are in just the perfect spot.",1467918756000,61,False

4.0,Absolutely protects from drops & water exposure. Can hold heat & inhibits easy batter swapping,"I just spend a small fortune on a new LG V10 phone - these things are really just small computers and they need to be protected as such. Mine goes everywhere with me, including the horse barn and out in the woods and pastures on horseback. I drop my phones and sometimes they get grabbed by the Donkey, so I don't mess around when I am picking a case for for use outside. I trust OtterBox - it saved a Blackberry several years ago after I dropped it in a four foot deep water trough.<br /><br />This case is the traditional Otterbox three layer protection I've come to expect. I already have a tempered glass screen protector on my phone of course, but the additional plastic cover from the Otterbox doesn't make any significant difference when using the touchscreen. With just the basic cover on and locked, you have full access to the camera, the volume rockers and the power button/fingerprint scanner. The charger slot is easily used by lifting up the flap on the bottom of the case and it closes again.<br /><br />Putting the third piece on, the rubber bumper is both where you get the absolute best protection and lose the full functionality of your phone. First - I've noticed a couple of times where the rubber bumper slips just a tiny bit and can interfere with the flash on the camera.  Second - One of the things I love about the LG V10 and the primary reason I purchased it was for the ability to change out the battery when I am not able to get to a charger. Like...out at the barn working with the horses. Which is also where I need the Otterbox case the most. I have to remove the entire three piece system to get to my phone and swap the battery out and then go through the rigamarole of snapping everything back together again. (I know, I know...first world problem.)  Third - If I am using the pedometer app, using bluetooth to send music to a speaker, and perhaps checking email all at once with the bumper on, the phone can get a bit hot. If it's just the two piece case, this does not happen. My main problem is that if you use the holster back then you cannot access the power button or volume at all unless you remove it entirely.<br /><br />So I do essentially love the Otterbox and I will continue to use it every day that I am out at the barn because it absolutely will save my phone at some point. History has proven this to be true. I just have to make sure I start my morning with a fully charged battery on an Otterbox day.",1462819827000,9,False
5.0,"Much easier process than last year. Zero bubbles, no degradation of screen clarity. See photo","I have used the iCarez screen protectors in various formats on multiple devices for several years with excellent results every time - I currently have them on two Fire tablets and it was a no brainer to go directly to iCarez for a tempered glass protector for my brand new LG V10 phone. (I also watched a video online of a guy hammering his and then removing it - no damage at all to his phone) The instruction booklet inside said that they have simplified the installation process, so I scanned the bar code and watched the video before I did anything. Sure enough, it's easier than last summer when I put the last one on a tablet. Plus the clarity and gorgeous display are in no way degraded by this glass protector - my photos etc are still just as sharp and pretty as before.<br /><br />The key here is be vigilant about making the screen absolutely pristine before you apply the protector and to do it on a level surface. I used the kitchen counter top. Wipe the phone all in one direction with the provided wet wipe and then the dust cloth. REPEAT. Repeat again and do not touch the screen. Wait a few seconds for it to dry completely. Then apply the screen protector - since this is a tempered glass unit, it's stiff and will set in place much more easily than the old fashioned plastic ones, but it's also harder to re-position, so go slow and get it right.

The fit is correct and the case doesn't interfere in any way with the camera, flash, volume rocker or the fingerprint sensor/power button. I have zero problems using my phone or the fingerprint scanner with this case on it.<br /><br />My one drawback is that if you want to take this case off and do a battery swap on a super busy day (and let's be honest - the V10 is awesome, but a battery hog), it can be difficult.

5.0,Three full days on one charge! Multitasking is smooth & fast. Champagne phone on a beer budget. UPDATE,"This is my first experience with a BLU brand phone and my first experience with a dual SIM card phone, but not the first trip down the aisle with Android phones. My current phone is a Fire Phone and previously I used an unlocked Samsung Galaxy Note, so I had an idea of what to expect and what I hoped to find in the BLU Studio Energy 2 that is/was missing from the other two. BLU definitely hit a homerun here.<br /><br />The physical phone is a bit heavier than some of the other flagship phones out there, but with the big battery that's to be expected. The body is a deep grey color with snap off back that is tight enough to require deliberate effort to remove. Inside you find the dual micro SIM card slots and the SD card slot. All three installed easily for me and worked immediately with no drama. We initially tested this phone using a prepaid AT&T Go Phone SIM card from a local store. No problems at all and the service was going and we were making and receiving calls & text messages in ten minutes.<br /><br />The battery in this thing is simply amazing. Before installing a SIM card, we charged it over night and turned it on at 6pm on Tuesday. My husband and I both used it as a mini tablet on WiFi only - we played games, streamed music from Amazon Prime, watched videos, surfed the net, did email, plugged in a Google account and downloaded apps, took photos, Bluetooth connected to the Echo and the car. For two full days without ever charging the phone! On Friday morning at 7:30am it still had a 51% charge left. Even after installing the SIM card and making calls, I didn't recharge the phone until Saturday morning.<br /><br />The calls are clear and clean both incoming and out going. The signal strength is solid - that certainly will vary depending on your location and service provider. BLU has some of the best built in ringtones I've ever seen in a cell phone - the rendition of Hallelujah is lovely. Adding and making my own ringtones for each contact was painless. We haven't tested our European SIM card yet for calls, but the phone recognized it with no issues. The camera is pretty good and has a variety of settings to choose from if you don't want to eat up space with a photo app. One thing I really like is noticeably less bloatware on this phone than the Samsung Note I had previously. The 1.5 GB Ram and quad core processor shine through - with 5 web pages open and switching between three active apps, I have not seen any sluggish behavior or stuttering at all. It just works - even while downloading several songs and playing Angry Birds at the same time with a text conversation going.<br /><br />BLU has thoughtfully included a rubberized bumper style cover, screen protector, earbuds and two charging cables with the phone. It's ready to be a part of your life immediately. Just sign in, pop in your SIM card and go. For the price, features, and the freedom of being an unlocked world phone, combined with this awesome battery - I am converted. There is no reason to buy an over priced phone from the carriers ever again. I'm keeping this one and buying a second one for my husband.<br /><br />******* UPDATE NOV 7, 2015 *******<br /><br />My husband took this phone with him to Amsterdam this past week and it worked with no problems. He also used the Magic Jack app in conjunction with our existing Magic Jack account and the free WiFi at the airport - worked perfectly. No international minutes used on either SIM card that way.",1446089842000,7,False

Sometimes you just need a small clutch or casual (and still cute!)cross body purse for the bare essentials - a piece that can get banged around or exposed to inclement weather on the go with no worries. This one from Belfen definitely fits these requirements.<br /><br />There is a tag inside that says it is made of real leather and it feels like it, even the detachable strap is leather. Using it crossbody, the bag hits exactly at the top my hip without the strap digging in anywhere. The color isn't a true brown - more a burnt orange. Remember the Burnt Sienna crayon?

5.0,Waterproof way to take my smartphone trail riding or hiking with the dogs,"I received a sample of this Wiszen waterproof phone case (in the clear) for testing and review and I am glad I accepted it. It weighs nothing and is actually very flexible which means it could easily be packed and taken on vacation or stored in the glove box of your car until needed. It comes with two carrying options - an adjustable velcro strap that slides through the handle on the back or a longer lanyard you could wear around your neck or tie to something. I attached it to my pants belt loop walking dogs in the woods - my phone wasn't at risk of falling out of my pockets while throwing a ball or wrestling around with the hounds. The case stayed closed and there was no humidity built up inside or on my phone afterwards.<br /><br />The clear plastic does allow for operation of the touchscreen display and there is a second clear plastic window on the back so you can shoot pictures without removing your phone. The photos are a little fuzzy, but you do have a barrier in front of the lens. No deduction there.

5.0,"Very nice case, excellent layout for. the closure, great rich brown","Fits the Fire Phone perfectly and camera cut out doesn't slip and interfere with your pictures. I really like the closure on this case. It just works, it is offset rather than over the lip of the case. What that means is the latch doesn't catch on stuff in my purse or as I pull my phone out of my pocket. The material looks great and is a classic saddle brown color that goes well with many outfits - I change my phone cases often and consider them as accessories much as I do my handbags or shoes. This one is a good neutral.",1429490636000,6,True
3.0,"Fits perfectly, NO PROTECTION if you drop your phone","This is not really a case by my standards. It's more like a smooth cover or shell for the back of your Fire phone, a swatch of color that at most, prevents the back and sides of the phone from being scratched and scuffed up. It's a soft, rubber like material that is very thin and doesn't add any bulk to my Fire Phone - this is one good thing, you can slip the phone right in your pants pocket with this shell on it. The cover doesn't provide any protection at all for the front of the phone and to be honest, if you drop it on the sidewalk or a tile floor, I doubt it would really help much on the back of the phone.<br /><br />The cover does fit perfectly, all the cutouts for the Firefly button, volume and power buttons are exact and the flash & camera all work exactly with it on. My grey cover looked very nice on my phone, but to be honest, I only used it for two days before I had a scare and went back to my Poetic flip case which can be closed to cover the face of the phone when it's in your purse etc. I was sitting at the dining table playing Tofu Fury on my phone which requires some moving around - sure enough, the phone slipped a bit and almost dropped  3 inches from my hands to the wood table top. My friend commented that maybe I needed an &#34;actual&#34; case with some padding and something that would absorb an impact.

On the way back, I used ONE of the Onite 2750 batteries for all the same activities and still had 58% left when we landed in Houston.

5.0,"Very nice case - holds the phone snugly, looks great","I like these Zenus cases for the Galaxy Note - they hold the phone snugly without straps and the phone does not slide out of the case. This is my second one and I really like the feel of the material and the look is great. The only complaint is that the hand strap has to be purchased separately at an additional cost - I was going to use the strap from my other Zenus case, but it totally doesn't match. The little kickstand on the back is a neat idea and implemented nicely. It stays closed when not in use via a tiny magnet so it's never popping loose or in the way when you don't need it. One note to future buyers - this case ships from Korea and takes about a week to ten days to arrive. Not a big deal - mine arrived in excellent packaging and within 10 days since I ordered it.

The driving moc sole is grippy on slick tile floors, but silent as you walk. There is a real arch support inside the shoes which means after hours on your feet you won't be limping. I actually bought these a half size smaller than similar style shoes in other brands, so keep that in mind. My Mother got a pair in the black leather and ended up buying a half size smaller than normal as well. I have wide feet and the tie on top of the toe box does loosen a bit giving just a tiny bit more room where the sides of your toes sit inside the shoe so they don't rub. They are very pretty on the foot and the white is a true, bright, crisp summer white - no cream or beige undertones to the color. I will probably get another pair in the rose suede at some point.",1364086252000,7,False
5.0,Gorgeous case & fit is perfect!,"I have been through four cases for my Galaxy Note in recent months and there is always some little problem or with one of them a huge flaw. Not this Prestige case. your phone pops into the holder without needing to remove the back over and it fits snugly. My test was pretty unscientific, but told me what I needed to know about the security of the phone inside the case - Holding the whole thing over the bed, I banged on it from every angle, bounced it, shook it vigorously, dropped it and the case never let go of the phone!<br /><br />I only keep a lens wipe in the pocket, so I cannot speak to the space available for credit cards etc. The case is very pretty and feels solid in your hand. The spine is flexible and the snap closure is tight. I have no problems just folding the front cover back when speaking on the phone. Hopefully this case will last several months with hard daily use - in & out of pockets, purses, the car all day long. So far I feel like the $49 price tag was worth it - and I got a compliment on the case in an elevator yesterday from a stranger.",1354924995000,2,True
5.0,SECURE case for the Galaxy Note,"In the month I have had my new Galaxy Note, I have tried four cases and three different types of belt clips and ended up ticked off and aggravated each time. Until the Cellet Executive Case. This thing looks good and actually works! First the Note slides into the case from the top and it fits as it should. Then the flap of the case folds down over the top - preventing the phone from falling out if the case is upended.<br /><br /> Secondly the case snaps closed with an actual snap instead of a magnet on the bottom - securely holding your phone inside the case where it belongs. Third - the top flap is elevated just a bit so that when it's snapped closed the top part does not scratch your phone screen - even with something tucked into the packet of the flap. I still use a screen protector, but the spacing is a nice perk with this case. There is a tiny little loop on the outside edge of the case where you could attach a cord (like you would on a camera).<br /><br />Fourth - the belt clip is built into the case rather than an after thought add on. It is also stitched on, so one can assume it should stay in place with regular use. Two full days of use and the belt clip has held my Note nicely in place on my hip while out at the barn working with the horses - the last two I tried both failed and broke within hours! The leather on the case is smooth and looks good - there is a light saddle tan color on the inside that contrasts very nicely with the black exterior. The cutouts for the camera, S-Pen, speaker and volume buttons are all placed correctly and do not interfer with normal use of the phone's features. My only complaint is that the power button cutout slightly overlaps the actual power button, so you have to push through a tiny sliver of leather - not a big deal at all in the general overview. Certainly not enough of a problem to warrant a star deduction.<br /><br />On a humorous note - the first day using this case had my Mother laughing out loud. Apparently flipping the top back to use the phone reminded her of the old Tri-corders from the original Star Trek. Now...admittedly, I am a total Sci-Fi geek, so this does have a certain appeal. I am ordering a second one of these cases as a back up for the future. Definately worth every penny!",1349370488000,1,True

This Naztech clip was the third one I tried and like the others, it's just garbage. Honestly, I expected the adhesive to fail at some point, not the physical clip. I used this very lightly THREE TIMES and teh plastic clip fell apart. The lever you pinch back to open the clip broke in half and then while I was looking at it, the circle part on the back that slides into the knob on your phone case actually crumbled in my hand! WTF? When I say I used it lightly, I mean I put the phone in my pocket and attempted to attach the clip to the pocket lip on my jeans. It was NOT supporting any weight, just acting as a back up to prevent the phone from sliding up or out of the pocket. DO NOT BUY THIS AT ANY PRICE.",1349196370000,0,True
5.0,"Charges properly, includes spare battery","Coming from years of Blackberry, I was horrified to find my new Galaxy Note is an enormous battery hog! The one thing Blackberry does better than anyone else out there is conservation of battery power with their devices. I adore my new Note and all it's slick functions & abilities and of course the giant screen. The trade off is insane power consumption, so finding a spare battery & charging dock was one of the first things I did when I made the switch. This charger stand carries the Samsung brand name & an original Samsung battery for the Note and it works perfectly. I find I can run through an entire charge in less than 8 hours of steady use some days - email, music, audio books, calls and the like. Having a second fully charged battery ready to go is a must! The power cord works with the dock and directly with the phone if you need. I would buy this again in a heartbeat.",1349106268000,0,True
4.0,"Holds the Note tightly, feels solid in the hand","I needed a clip on case to secure my new Galaxy Note to my waistband or inside a pocket while working out at the barn, but I did not want one that was terribly bulky or would interfer with one handed use. Primarily my interest is in keeping my phone from falling into a water bucket etc while I'm working and being able to listen to podcasts or music while working.<br /><br />This case is thin and easily allows access to both the sleep button and the volume and doesn't impede your ability to use the touchscreen or home buttons and it doesn't poke your cheek when you make a call with it on the phone. The case fits very snugly around the phone and then you slide the phone with the case on into the second part that has the spring clip. I seriously doubt the phone could ever fall out of this case! My ONLY complaint is that if you put the phone into the clip piece in one direction you cannot access the earphone jack and if you flip it over to use your earphones, you cannot have it attached to a charger while in the case. One the belt clip piece is attached you also lose access to your camera - again, if you flip the phone around and put it with the screen facing inside & the camera lense facing outside, you cannot interact with the phone. That is the only reaason for the single star deduction. On the plus side, this case will work nicely at the barn or out walking the dogs and that's all that you really need for less than $10.",1347330777000,2,True
5.0,Received as a gift - very handy!,"I just got this Powermat for the Blackberry Torch and I really like it. It does exactly what it says it will do - charges your Blackberry by simply setting it down on the mat. The initial setup was a bit frustrating - the little connection piece that joins the new battery cover door and the original micro USB insert has to be installed for the mat to send power to your phone. It would have been helpful if the instructions booklet had a slightly better diagrams, but I figured it out. Meanwhile the good stuff.... charges fast! It has a small white light that goes on when your phone is aligned properly on the mat and makes this wierd chirping noise to let you know it is aligned properly and when you move it. (It's a pretty distinct sound - nothing like the little beeps etc your phone normally makes for incoming messages and the like) Honestly I am really liking this whole Powermat idea - no more fumbling with that tiny micro USB charging cord and the plug in on the phone!

5.0,MUCH better than headset included with new Torch UPDATE Jan 2012,"After suffering real pain every single day using the headset that came standard with my new Blackberry Torch, I knew I had to make a change or give up listening to my audio-books and music. Giving up the music, podcasts, podiobooks and handsfree phone use is NOT an option - I work outside with horses several hours a day - gotta have my media! The set of earbuds that came with the phone worked well, but my ears a tad small and they were just too big. Plus the hard metal & plastic literally caused a painful bruise on one ear. After tons of research I decided on these for several reasons. As it turns out these are very good both with regard to sound and actual daily functionality.<br /><br />They are a Blackberry product thus compatible with my phone. They have a microphone and a remote control with the volume, skip and pause on the cord - no need to remove the phone from your holster or pocket! All these buttons worked properly as soon as the headset was plugged into my phone. (No learning curve or difficulty with the new Blackberry OS.6) One note on the remote control - there is a 2 second delay from the time you initiate a command before the phone reacts. If you have voice dialing set up on your Torch it can work with this headset and that is very nice. Sound quality is good with simple voice narration from an audio book. The sound is very good with actual music - in fact this headset is louder than the original, which means I no longer have to keep the volume at it's highest level. Additionally, if you click the options in the BB menu on your phone, you can adjust the sound to reflect the type of music you're listening to and this headset does reflect the change. The carrying case is hard and fits well in a purse or the center console of the car. But most importantly the ear buds are size adjustable with the three different size tips included. The multiple options are easy to change out and since one of my ears is slightly smaller than the other I can put a small tip on the left and a medium tip on the right side - NO MORE PAIN!!<br /><br />I like these so much I am considering buying another set for travel.<br /><br />*************Jan 2012 UPDATE ***********************<br /><br />After almost a full year of regular use, these headphones are working just fine with no issues at all.

I can't say enough good things. The shoulder trigger buttons have each their own strong hepatic feed back motor so it feels like your really clicking a physical button. You can map the shoulder triggers for any game to use any buttons you want . You can also change how the triggers work for example you can use them like triggers in call of duty mobile for aim then shoot. You can use them as sliders to do different functions depending on how you slide your finger over the shoulder buttons. You can set the pressure of how hard u need to squeeze the buttons before they do something it's all tunable I live this phone to sum it up the whole phone is tunable to what you prefer. Every aspect you can change. Lights, themes, even has built in equalizer called sound wizard very cool. Speakers are amazing!

It turns a small phone screen into a screen about the size visually of a portable dvd player.<br /><br />My husband had a lot of trouble getting his phone to stay in place with the thin plastic flap on the tray part. He got around this by using a different metal phone holder (also purchased on Amazon) to hold his phone in place and moving the screen in front of it.<br /><br />In my opinion, they have a good thing going with this screen magnifier, but it could be very good if they used thicker plastic on the rest of the unit.

The design is okay. But UGH... the weird texture of the case is off-putting!  It has a cross-hatch-like design pressed into the plastic cover. It feels kind of nasty under the fingertips. In addition, it makes the case pretty slick to hold onto. It has slid out of my grip a couple times already.<br /><br />The rubbery silicone phone holder part is a nice color. But I thought at first my phone wasn't going to fit.

2.0,The biggest problem is Straight Talk!,"My husband got this phone a few months ago.<br />It works fine as a phone, WHEN Straight talk is working.<br /><br />You can take photos, send texts easily, and overall, everything works okay.<br />The texting area is a little small for my husband, who has to use a pen to<br />poke the little letters because of his big fingers.<br />Calls are clear, we haven't had any drop yet, so that gets a thumbs up as well.<br /><br />BUT....<br /><br />He uses the ""All You Need"" plan with this phone, which gives you 30 days of service,<br />with 1000 minutes of talk and 1000 texts, as well as some odd amount of web time.<br />That's all well and good, and it works well for him.<br />However, the Straight Talk Reserve plan has huge flaws for the All You Need cards.<br /><br />Every single month, it is a nightmare. We add a card to the reserve a few days before the<br />30 days is up. Each and every time so far, the phone stops DEAD on the 30th day, and the reserve<br />does not automatically roll over. Each time, we have to call tech support (a long, long wait<br />to reach someone who does not speak English as their native language) and go through the arduous<br />process of resetting the minutes and having him text *2_ _ _ _ (some number, not sure what it is)<br />to reactive the phone.<br /><br />That part is beyond ridiculous.<br />It is annoying, time wasting, and very inconvenient when you use your phone for work.<br /><br />At this point, we are ready to change.  Both of my college aged kids use Straight Talk<br />on the Unlimited Everything plan and don't have this problem. Apparently, the inconvenience is<br />limited to the All You Need, perhaps in some twisted attempt to get to you upgrade to the more<br />expensive plan. Either that, or they have really bad programming on the reserve!<br /><br />Either way, it is bad enough that my husband is ready to move on to another phone and another provider.<br />It's a shame, since the calls are clear.<br />But you have to be able to count on your phone, and you just can't with this one (which is for Straight Talk).<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />As of May 2013, after yet another bad experience in April with the All You Need plan not working correctly,<br />We ordered another phone from another company, and have changed over to Net10. It isn't perfect either, but the<br />unused minutes roll over without expiration dates, and no hassles at all about loading extra time.<br />Buh-bye Straight Talk! You really need to work on your service! It chased us away.",1361827257000,4,False

What I like the best about this design, however, is that it has a<br />slight 3D effect - it looks like there are two or three layers of graphics.<br />The flowers and butterflies are the top, with the muted leaves below that, and<br />splashes of blue below that. Very nice effect.<br /><br />I would definitely repurchase this case when it breaks (and face it - they all do eventually).",1351925792000,2,False
5.0,Best place to buy these pens! LOVE THEM!,"We have a lot of ""devices"" in our house that need this type of pen.<br />We've tried several other kinds, including much more expensive pens.<br /><br />We originally bought a different set of these from this seller because of the great<br />color combinations. Well, we found out that not only are they great looking, they work<br />better than any of the other capacitive pens that we've tried!<br /><br />This is a repeat purchase for us, getting a different color combination. Again, fabulous results from<br />The Friendly Swede - well packaged, shipped quickly and great pens!<br />When I opened the package, I was immediately swarmed with (older) kids wanting a certain color!<br />(That's fine with me, but there WILL be trouble if anyone takes Mom's green one! I have permanent<br />'dibs' on anything in apple green that enters the house. Ha!)<br /><br />If you are not having as great a response with your touch screen as you might like, check your pen.<br />There are differences in the quality of these pens (although a lot of people sell them now), and they DO<br />wear out. My old pen (from the same seller) did not look that bad, but I noticed that I was having to drag<br />or retouch some things more often. The pen didn't look worn out, but it was getting there. (Using it several<br />times every day for months - go figure that it wore out!) The new pen made an immediate difference.<br /><br />I just don't think you can find a better pen or a better seller. The color combinations available here are<br />beyond compare (and what first caused me to purchase here). Everyone will find something that they like.<br />The seller also offers a big variety of pen SIZES, so if you have very small hands, you want one for a child, or<br />you need a bigger size, you'll find a pen here that will work for you.<br /><br />I'm just so pleased with these. I got six pens for a little less than I paid for ONE pen from another seller.<br />The more expensive pen came in a nice box (which was immediately discarded), but it didn't really do much else.<br />That was why I came back to Amazon to shop for a different pen in the first place.<br />You don't have to shop here, but honestly, why would you want to shop any place else?<br />Yes, I'm a huge fan - when you've never had a bad experience with a seller, you notice!<br /><br />So, add some color to your life, and grab a package of these capacitive pens. They work so well!<br />I wore mine out on my Nook, but my kids use them for the Nook, Fire and of course, their phones.<br /><br />Thank you, The Friendly Swede, for making a great product, and providing outstanding service!",1342787749000,4,True
5.0,Very nice case - fits very well,"We bought this case for an LG Optimus S (slider phone) from Wal Mart.<br />It fits very well!<br /><br />The case comes in three pieces in a bag with no instructions, but it isn't<br />too hard. (If it is, then you might want to rethink the need for a ""smart phone""<br />in the first place.) There is a black rubber base for the bottom, and the<br />skeletal portion snaps on to the bottom case over the black part. The third piece<br />is a thin case for the slider portion. Just be careful with this part - it is easy<br />to get it upside down and it could break the tiny snap-on parts on the underneath of<br />the case.<br /><br />There are many reviews about the color mis-representation in this listing.<br />I have to say that I expected it to be pink, not purple, based on other reviews.<br />Here's the thing - have you ever seen that car paint that looks one color from one angle,<br />and another color from another angle?  That's what the deal is here... what color you<br />see depends on the angle you are viewing from.  I am including a couple photos to show<br />what I mean. I also did a mini-movie so folks could see it, but I'll upload that at a later date.<br /><br />The case itself feels so neat - sort of a velvetly-textured rubber. It is definitely<br />comfortable in the hand, and helps make the phone not so slick to hold. The top piece<br />doesn't really block the slider or keys at all. It does take up a miniscule amount of space<br />right at the top row of keys, but you'd have to have very large thumbs to be affected by that.<br />If you need to access your battery you'll have to take the case back off, but just do it<br />carefully so the little snap-on spots don't break off.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very good case, and we're glad we got it. How it holds up remains to be seen,<br />but I don't anticipate a lot of problems. It is worth buying.",1335058659000,0,True
5.0,Really great pens - be sure to try these,"I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised.<br />I had purchased another brand of pen that cost a heckuva lot more than<br />these do.

Who ever said the pens had to be boring?<br />If you wear a black suit and white shirt to work every day, then these might<br />not be your thing. But if you love color, love variety, then try them!<br /><br />They are a little bit shorter than my other pen, but they work better, IMHO.<br />They are not little nubby pens, but run maybe an inch shorter than the expensive ones,<br />and are shorter than a regular ink pen.<br /><br />Gotta say that now I am interested in getting more colors of this pen.<br />They are comfy, colorful and work great!<br />Quick shipment too...<br />It's all good!",1332546262000,0,True

5.0,not all styluses are created equal...,"The brand really does make a difference!<br /><br />Over the years that I've owned an iPad, I've purchased several sets of styluses, several from this brand (Friendly Swede) and several from other brands.  Without exception, the Friendly Swede styluses are clearly superior to the several other brands I've tried.<br /><br />I’ve used rubber tips and fiber tips and prefer the fiber tips.  This brand comes out on top in both versions, but it’s especially evident of the fiber tip styluses.  They “register” as far as immediate recognition much faster and cleaner than the alternatives I've tried.  I do quite a lot of fine detail work.  With other brands, I would need to touch/drag multiple times before it actually selected or moved text or item.  Not so with the Friendlly Swede.  It works every time with no need to repeat the gestures.<br /><br />The multipacks are a good bargain as you get extra replacement tips (and instructions on how to swap out the bad tip for a new one).  I like to tuck an extra stylus in my travel bag just in case I misplace one (yes, it has happened before).<br /><br />This will be my “go-to” brand for styluses in the future -- no more succumbing to the temptation of a lower-price “bargain.”  You really do get what you pay for.",1652080145447,0,True
5.0,"Heavy, but definitely holds a lot of charge ...","I purchased two of these on the Amazon subsidiary, Woot! ...<br /><br />I purchased my first in January -- a blue one -- and liked it so much I purchased a second one (white this time) in February.<br /><br />I'll keep one at home in case of power outages (they don't happen too often, but I like to be prepared).  The other goes in my emergency travel/""hospital"" bag.  Unfortunately, I've had to make several ER trips over the past 1.5 years that have resulted in hospital admission -- and while I always have my iPhone with me, I haven't had the means to recharge it, depending on friends or hospital staff to help out until I can my hands on a charging cable/etc.  I now maintain a ""grab and go"" bag for those times when I'm headed off somewhere where I might need to recharge my phone, packing a few toiletries, nightclothes, etc. AND this charger plus a charging cable or two.  I'll be checking it every month and recharging it as needed so that if I need to head off to the hospital, it will be fully charged.<br /><br />I like that it also has the flashlight feature -- although I always have flashlights laying around the apartment -- but it never hurts to have more.<br /><br />Honestly, I have no complaints about this at all.  It charges both iPhone 12 mini and IPad Pro multiple times on a single charge, so it works perfectly as far as I'm concerned.  If anything changes as to performance/etc., I'll definitely revise my review, but for now, it's a solid 5 stars from me.",1646005226514,0,False
5.0,No issues so far ...,"I prefer these elastic bands for my Series 6 Apple Watch as I use it for monitoring O2, pulse, exercise, etc., and it needs to fit securely on my wrist.  Elastic bands allow for more flexibility in terms of how tight the band is worn, so this works well for me.<br /><br />I purchased this set of 2 bands (the multi-colored ""rainbow""-ish ones) mostly for the colors -- we're heading into spring here in the Pacific NW, which means our gray cloudy chilly days will soon be replaced by less-gray sunnier warmer days -- with the burst of spring color that follows.  It just seemed fitting to replace my gray stretchy band with a multi-colored stretchy band.<br /><br />In terms of quality, I have no complaints at all.  The band stays secure -- it doesn't loosen with wearing (I think another review mentioned that -- it hasn't happened in my case).  The ""clasp"" (more like a sliding size adjustor) stays put, and no metal touches my skin (I'm kind of allergic to some metals) -- no discomfort there at all.  Many versions of this type of stretchy band have plastic size adjustors which kind of cheapens the look in my opinion.<br /><br />No problems at all with these -- I like them a lot and will likely purchase another set for summer wear.",1645994429233,2,True
5.0,No problems ...,"I've definitely developed an affinity for elastic Watch bands.  They make the watch so much easier to take on and off.<br /><br />This set is particularly nice.  I wear mostly black or navy slacks, so the dark gray and navy two-tone bands work very nicely with my wardrobe.  Easy to install, too.  No issues with adjusting the size -- I need to keep the watch fairly close (not too tight, but not loose, either) as I use it to monitor pulse and O2.  The elastic bands just do a better job with that.<br /><br />No issues with quality or durability, either.  Very nice bands.",1635726283081,0,True
5.0,"Nice bands, fit my Series 6 40mm watch perfectly ...","I decided to change out my standard-issue black silicone band for something more colorful and found these.  My wrist tends to run a little large (around 8"") and not all bands fit, so I figured elastic might be a good choice.<br /><br />These are adjustable, so I'm able to get a precise comfortable fit.  I also use several of the health tracking features (O2, pulse, and ECG) and fit is critical, especially for the O2 function.  So far, this band is working even better than my old silicone band as I can get just the right ""tightness"" for the monitor to work.  The O2 monitor is particularly finicky, and so far, it's working perfectly every time.<br /><br />The bands are colorful, and since I tend to wear black slacks with bright solid jewel-tine tops, they fit my wardrobe, too.  My only reservation on these is durability -- so far, I haven't noticed any problems, but I'm not certain they'll last more than a year or so.  Time will tell.  The cost isn't that great, so it's not a huge risk.<br /><br />Overall, I really like these.",1617563572970,50,True

The installation is so easy and fool-proof that even a klutz like me can get it onto my iPhone 8 perfectly aligned and straight.  In less than 5 minutes, the new protector was installed and my phone was ready to go.  How easy is that?<br /><br />And you get *2* protectors  -- definitely a great deal for a brand-name protector with a great reputation.  Solid five stars -- I like it that much.",1565988485935,0,True
4.0,Works great on my iPad...,"I've been using this stylus extensively over the past 3 weeks on my iPad -- at least 3-5 hours a day for various things.  So far, it has performed very nicely.  I had been using the rubber-tipped styluses (styli?), having to replace the rubber tips every 3-5 days (yes, really).  So not having to deal with that is a huge benefit.<br /><br />My only quibble is the length of this stylus -- it's about 1"" shorter than my other styluses and that 1"" makes a difference.  I have osteoarthritis in my hands and sometimes something as little as a 1"" in length can mean a change in how I ""grip"" it, which snowballs into some significant discomfort.  It's not a deal-breaker -- I still think this is a high-quality product and I can definitely recommend it.  I just have to be careful to change hand position periodically.<br /><br />I like this -- solid 4 stars.",1563413481107,0,False
4.0,Seems to work OK and the tripod is a nice addition to the usual selfie stick ...,"I got this to replace a selfie stick that went missing after my last cruise (I suspect it's buried somewhere in the depths of one of my suitcases, but its location isn't obvious ... ).<br /><br />At first examination, this is a nicely designed selfie stick.  It includes a Bluetooth remote that can be charged via USB cable -- a remote that stores conveniently on the stick itself making it less likely to get lost (I'm notorious for losing things -- see the first paragraph above ... ).  It also includes a built-in tripod that will be useful for stabilizing my iPhone (Product)red (basically a red standard iPhone 8).  Instructions are minimal but this isn't too tricky a device.<br /><br />Following the instructions, I attached the USB charger to the remote, and a red light appeared on the charging cable.  So far, so good.  Then it went out after a few minutes.  OK -- does that mean the remove is now fully charged?  No way to tell except to use it.  Determined that it's not an indication of whether or not the remote is fully charged:  I used the remote to take two test photos, then let it sit overnight.  Attempted to use it the next morning to find that it was depleted (wouldn't pair with my iPhone).  Plugged it in again to charge, left it the entire day, then again used it to snap two photos, left it overnight, and this time, it was still charged the next morning.  When in doubt, charge overnight to ensure you have power for the next day.<br /><br />The second issue came from the directions.  When you use the remote to pair with your phone, there's supposed to be a blue light on the remote that flashes to indicate that Bluetooth is turned on.  And after successful pairing, the blue light is supposed to stay on while paired.  The blue light on my remote never came on, either flashing or steady.  You press the power button on the remote to initiate and disconnect pairing (hold it down for 3 seconds in both cases).  Without the blue indicator light, I used the ""Settings"" on my phone to determine that Bluetooth pairing and disconnect were successful.  This isn't a dealbreaker for me -- but it was an annoyance and I docked one star for this.<br /><br />Once pairing was complete, use of the selfie stick is fairly straightforward.  You put your phone into the holder, follow the instructions (you need to swivel it around 180 degrees), set the angle (untighten/tighten the bolt on the side of the holder), activate your camera app, and you're set to go.  You can leave the remote in its place on the stick and use it as a ""normal"" selfie stick.  Or you can detach the remote and use it with or without the tripod to trip the shutter (make sure your camera app has the volume button set to act as the shutter when the camera app is ""live"" -- I think the app on my iPhone is automatically set for this as I didn't have to change anything to get it to work).  In that respect, it works as advertised -- no issues so far.<br /><br />Overall, I do like this -- I'll be taking it on my next trip (cruise to Hawaii, Tahiti, and French Polynesia) in Mar/April and I'll see how it holds up under the stress of travel and fairly heavy use.  If I encounter any further issues, I'll update this review.",1544226643754,0,False
4.0,Better than pricier alternatives I've tried ...,"I was more impressed with this stylus than I thought I'd be.  It's well designed, comfortable to use, and accurate.<br /><br />It has a capacitive stylus that unscrews to reveal a powered high-precision stylus.  The capacitive stylus can be ""stored"" on the opposite end (covering the charging port), a feature that works well for me as I tend to misplace bits and pieces that disconnect from things.<br /><br />I tested the fine-point stylus on several applications on both iPhone 8(red) and my iPad Pro, including free-hand drawing, coloring, and writing, and it performed well in all of them.  I didn't notice any skipping or dragging.  The capacitive stylus worked as expected for navigating and selecting.<br /><br />Bottom line:  I like it!  I'm replacing my current stylus with this one.  If I detect any durability issues, I'll update this review.  But after 2 weeks of use, this is performing well.",1541197294869,1,False
5.0,"Quality product, great for travel ...","I've recently started doing some cruise travel, and I always take along a bunch of electronics that over time need recharging.

I can charge my iPhone, iPad, wireless keyboard, external batteries, and smart stylus at the same time (although I don't often need to recharge them all at once).  It works just fine, and I like that the power cord is detachable (makes packing a bit easier).<br /><br />I have one plugged in at home all the time, and one that stays in my carry-on bag so I don't need to worry about forgetting to pack it.

Someone on a cruise social network site recommended this, so I thought i’d give it a try.<br /><br />So far, it’s working fine.  It fits my phone and the Soeck case I have on it, the camera lens is NOT obscured, it’s easy to apply and remove, and most important it provides the security I need to comfortably take photos from close to my balcony rail.<br /><br />I usually wrap the strap around my wrist a couple of times so that if I lose my grip on the phone, it won’t go very far.<br /><br />Good buy, if only for the peace of mind knowing i’m much less likely to lose my phone.",1533738094827,0,True
3.0,"Does the job, but how economical is it? ...","The Boost Up Bold is easy to set up, basically just attach the power cord, plug it in, put it on a flat surface, and center your Qi-enabled device on top.<br /><br />I have an iPhone 8 RED with an OtterBox Symmetry Series Clear case.  It charges my phone fairly quickly, but not that much faster than my current Belkin 5W Boost Up wireless charging pad that I purchased just two months ago for half the cost of this.  The primary differences between the two are size/thickness (my older/new-ish charging pad is larger and flatter) and this new 10W model has a rubber surface that prevents the phone from slipping if the surface isn't completely flat -- that's a nice bonus.<br /><br />But I'm not sure it's enough to account for the cost differential between the two.  I like the smaller footprint, but again, that's more cosmetic.<br /><br />For me, this is an OK wireless charging pad.  Perhaps if I didn't already own another Belkin charging pad, I might feel differently about this.  Belkin quality is consistently good across both products.  Bottom line:  3 stars -- it's OK.",1528852461895,0,False

5.0,There's a lot to like here ...,"I originally purchased a Mophie Juice Pack Helium several months ago as my first foray into battery/charging cases for my iPhone 5s.  When I was offered this Vysk model, I decided to give it a try, to see which I preferred.<br /><br />Easy answer:  I'm switching to the Vysk EP1.  There's a lot to like about it:<br /><br /> -- ""non-slip"" grip<br />It has a textured back that makes it less likely to slip, and the edges are ""angled"" rather than curved like the Mophie.  The Mophie, although a nice case, was just too slippery compared to the Vysk.<br /><br /> -- It's MUCH easier to install than the Mophie.  I have a ""thin-film"" type screen protector on my iPhone and I didn't have any problem getting the case on the phone smoothly and easily.  I also like that the buttons on the phone actually protrude out of the Vysk case -- just far enough to be useful, but not so far that removing the case is impacted too much.  Because of the design, the earphone jack is recessed so there's a ""dongle"" supplied which allows you to use wired headphones (just like on the Mophie).<br /><br /> -- Recharging the phone from the case is relatively fast (&lt; 2 hrs from 5% to 100% on the phone).<br /><br /> -- I got one full (100%) charge from the case plus about a 50% second charge without recharging the case.<br />I had charged both phone and case to 100%.  Used the phone with the case switch ""off"" until phone got down to 5% charge.  Turned the case to + (on), and charged the phone.  As soon as the phone got to 100%, I turned the case off.  Ran the phone down to 5% again, turned the case on, and got to 58% before the Vysk ran out of power.  That's not too shabby, really.<br /><br />Basically, this unit exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />There are a few things that might be considered negatives:<br /><br /> -- As mentioned above, you have to us a separate ""dongle"" in order to use wired headphones.  That means you have to keep track of that little gizmo, and it might a somewhat inconvenient.  I use Bluetooth headphones and speakers, so it's not an issue for me, but it might be for you.<br /><br /> -- The added security is nice, but the lens cover also covers the camera's flash, which doubles as the flashlight.  With the cover in place, you cannot use the flashlight.  You have to remember to slide the cover over if you need to use the flashlight.  I consider this a minor inconvenience, but others may consider it more troublesome.<br /><br /> -- It does add to the weight of the phone. It is, after all, a battery, so it's going to add some weight.  Again, I don't mind this but others might.<br /><br />Overall, I'm sold on the Vysk EP1 unit.  I wasn't expecting it to be that much better than the Mophie, and they actually both perform well.  But the Vysk has some extras that I like better, so it has my vote.

5.0,This one's a keeper ...,"For some reason, I seem to collect charging cables.  I like having them near where I'm likely to need to charge my phone, so that means having one in nearly every room.

4.0,Cute convenience -- and it works ...,"I'm always looking for electronic accessories that actually make my life easier.  This is one of those accessories.<br /><br />First, the pros:  it serves double duty: USB --> Lightning or Micro cable; and it's a functional small key ring.  Since I usually keep my car and house keys separate, I tend to use at least 2 key rings, and this could easily serve as one of them, which would give me a usable charging cable 24/7.<br /><br />It's brightly colored, so it's easy to spot in my bag.  It appears to be well made, sturdy, and unless unusually badly handled, it's not likely to rip or tear.  Should last awhile.<br /><br />The lightning attachment fits my iPhone 5S snugly, but not *too* snug -- in other words, it's fairly easy to plug it in.  I have a case on my iPhone, and it fits fine without having to remove the case.<br /><br />It seems to charge relatively quickly on the lightning attachment -- not as fast as the original Apple cable/etc., but would work fine to recharge overnight.  I didn't get an ""incompatible"" message, so my iPhone is happy with it.<br /><br />Cons:  My only quibble with this is the length of the cable.  You release the cable by pushing it through the hippo's ""mouth,"" but even fully extended, you have barely 2"" from USB to hippo and dual-headed lightning/micro to hippo.  This means that you'll need to be careful where you charge -- I have mine charging right now next to my laptop via the USB port on the computer, and it's fine.  I don't see how you could use your device WHILE it's charging -- there's just not enough ""play"" in the cable to allow for that.

So, go very slowly, and be very careful you do not accidentally touch the adhesive side.

(It doesn't bother me.)<br /><br />You can tell this is a quality screen cover. It feels very nice and smooth under the touch. Silky smooth.<br /><br />I did not detect any loss of touch sensitivity or screen clarity after the installation.<br /><br />Adhesion looks solid all the away around.<br /><br />I am glad I bought it, and recommend it.",1447232190000,1,True
3.0,Slippery When Not Wet,"The very first thing I wondered after holding this case is: Why did they have to make it so slippery? What was the point of making it slippery? I do not understand.<br /><br />Were there many people requesting a slippery case for their expensive iPhone 6 and/or 6S? (I know I certainly wasn't.)<br /><br />I can think of other materials they could have used that would not have resulted in a slippery case.<br /><br />On a different note: The company goes out of its way here at Amazon to brag how their case is Apple MFi certified. They neglect, however, to mention in advance that in spite of this MFi certification some people can still expect to get the error message on their iPhone that &#34;this accessory might not be supported.&#34; (They do include this fact on the instruction sheet you get with the case.)<br /><br />Sadly, at the current asking price for this case I cannot recommend it to those who do not want a slippery-feeling Qi charging case because of its slippery feel. Hopefully the company will eventually release a second generation case that is not as slippery, for those who prefer that.<br /><br />I do recommend this case for those who do not mind a slippery-feeling Qi charging case.<br /><br />To put your iPhone into this case you pull up very hard (it takes a bit of effort...perhaps too much effort) on the upper piece of the case. Slide your phone into the case and then snap the top back on.<br /><br />I like the fact the case is lightweight. I love the pull-out lightning connector at the bottom so you can insert a lightning cable when you are away from your Qi charging base. I like that the sound curves around the bottom and comes out the front.",1447056437000,10,True
2.0,Negative Experience With The Cinder I Received,"First please know that I installed the Cinder onto a brand new, fresh out of the box, iPhone 6S. The phone was untouched. As soon as the factory plastic was peeled off, installation, where I followed the instructions, was immediate.<br /><br />Of course, installation is usually not quite as easy as the video would make you believe. The red pull tab on the Cinder to peel off the cover from the backing broke off immediately, and thus was worthless. This made peeling off the back more difficult, but certainly doable.<br /><br />My Cinder arrived with some kind of small circular imperfection, with a tiny black dot in the center of the circle. I am uploading a picture. I am not sure it is easy to see in the picture, but it is there. It is not a bubble. It is not &#34;hazes&#34; (per the instruction manual). And it is not something that pushes towards the edge using pressure.<br /><br />Besides the very disappointing details above, which made me give this 2 stars which means &#34;I Don't Like It&#34; according to Amazon's ratings system, there are positives about the Cinder: The Cinder feels nice to the touch. The edge to edge looks nice. I was able to line up the Cinder screen cover relatively easy by going slow and being patient upon application. Touch sensitivity seems good.",1443212183000,17,True
5.0,Once You Go Wireless Charging You'll Never Want To Go Back,"The iNPOFi Wireless Charging System is very classy and nice and convenient. And it works exactly as advertised, and as you'd want. Everything seems well-built and good quality.<br /><br />Slipping the iPhone into the case is very easy to do. I bought the gold colored case, and I think it looks and feels nice.<br /><br />I can then put my phone right on top of the charging base and a light turns on, and the phone charges. It also allows you to use the wonderful &#34;Hey Siri&#34; feature, where you can communicate with Siri without having to touch the phone. (I love that. You only need to try the &#34;Hey Siri&#34; feature once to immediately become hooked. Make sure you turn on the feature in the Siri settings first, of course.)<br /><br />I am buying an extra charging base to keep in another room. It is so convenient.<br /><br />I also love the Mobile Charging Base. It is very easy to carry room to room, or take it with you when you go out.<br /><br />I recommend this wireless charging system, and the iNPOFi company. The company responds to calls and emails to answer questions.",1431023853000,0,True

My favorite colors are blue and light shades of green so it's only natural for me to love the emerald color of this case. If I had to get another case for whatever reason I would definitely get this exact same one because one I had it before so I already know what it's like and two because this case just calls out to me it's also like I was meant to see this case just because someone knew I would love it and want to get it immediately. This also showed me that sometimes the first thing we see catches our eye so much that we don't want anything else because what we saw was the very thing that we were looking for in the first place it be very foolish and inconsiderate to ourselves if we were to throw this very type of opportunity.""",1634515723083,0,False

5.0,Stop Looking and Buy This One. You Won't Find One Better for the Price.,"I teach an after-school photography program and I needed a bunch of tripods for my students. I was tight on cash, so I tried to get the $15 tripod, but that was stupid. They're not meant for SLRs at all. This may have been clear to everyone but me though. After I realized how they weren't going to work for me at all, I scoured Craigslist for a bunch of older Bogen tripods. I spent too much money, but felt good about them. I like finding deals so I paid less than they were worth...but then I found this tripod and realized I had actually wasted a lot of money. The larger, heavier tripods aren't really necessary for what I do. They're great for pros who want to have the biggest, best, and most expensive...which I was, and did, at one point. In my opinion, there's really no need to spend $50-$100 for a used Bogen tripod, or $200+ for a new one. These Ravelli's are sturdy and light weight. The weight is more important that I originally thought too. My students complained about the heavy metal tripods. They wouldn't take them out on their shoots. The Ravelli's are light weight and have the bag...which makes it a lot easier for my students to get out and shoot. Anyways. I really don't think you'll be disappointed with this tripod. I was pleasantly surprised. Frustrated that I spent too much before, but happy that I've found these guys now. Anybody need a used Bogen tripod? :)",1488499638000,0,False

2.0,No fingerprint cutout?  For a Moto Stylus 5G??,"PROS:  The dark heavy rubber or plastic ""bumpers"" and edges on this case are great.  I especially like the snap in flaps for the input/output ports on the bottom.  The back and the front snap together firmly and the case itself feels fairly indestructible.<br /><br />CONS:  The Amazon listing says this is ""Designed for Moto G Stylus 5G.""  Now, why in the world Poetic would market this without a cut out on the back side to accommodate people who use the fingerprint scanner is beyond me.  Using an X-acto knife I cut out an oval to allow access to the scanner, but I shouldn't have had to do that.  Furthermore the heavy plastic on the back leaves gaping open spaces by not clinging to the surface --a sure attractor of dust and debris ..and moisture, should the phone be dropped in water or splashed.  Secondly, the clear screen protector on the front is little more than a heavy grade Saran-type plastic.  It seems cloudy and doesn't cling to the surface well, leaving MANY bubbles, streaks, etc.  I have friends whose phones are uglier looking than that, but it's more than I can put up with.  There's no way this moderately thick clear plastic could protect a glass surface from cracking or scratching, imho.<br /><br />I'm keeping this case for the time being, but will very likely replace it with an Otterbox and tempered glass in the future.

4.0,Fits my Moto g7 Supra perfectly,"My 5 year old Samsung Note 4 recently died, and the only affordable replacement I could find is a Motorola Moto g7 Supra (Cricket).  I had been using a wonderful Caseology protective case on my Note 4, but didn't find one for the new Moto, so I chose this Spigen case.  It fits about the same, leaves plenty of access room for cameras and fingerprint authentication, etc.  I also like the fact that there's a small lip on the Spigen so that, if I put the Moto down screen down, the case keeps the screen from touching the surface I placed it upon.  The only thing I kind of dislike about it is that, rather than the slightly softer, grippy feel of my old case, this Spigen feels a bit more like XXX fine sandpaper.  Which is okay, except that, since the Moto is slightly heavier than my old Samsung, the grip feels a little less secure, and I have a feeling the Spigen will attract a lot more fine dust to its surface.

2.0,USABLE WITH CAVEATS! YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET!,"I have had the pan for about 5 months now. I find that it takes a noticeable time to heat up and once it does the cooking surface becomes convex and all the liquids float to the edges. There is a definite hot spot in the center that will actually burn anything that touches the area requiring careful attention while your cooking. If the handles are too close to the heating element or flame they get very hot! Be careful! Just a few minor scratches in the coating so far. Yes, easy clean up of most everything I cook in it. I always use plastic or rubber utensils with it and rarely need to wash it with other than a soft sponge. I also never heated it on ""High"" and most always cooked at medium heat. Because of the handles and the convex cooking surface when hot I would not buy this again. I chose this in favor of a more expensive heavier pan with lid that probably had one maybe two more coatings of the non-stick surface on it. Most of these pans last about 2-3 years before their scratches make them unhealthy to cook in anymore. It's just a fact of non-stick cookware. In general non-stick cookware  prices vary by thickness and type of metal and how many coatings are on it. There can be as little as 2 and as much as 5 coatings but unfortunately that doesn't really extend the life of the surface very much. A more expensive pan would be less likely to warp, probably heat more evenly and the handle or handles would remain cool. My last large pan like this was made in Sweden. It was much heavier and cooked very well but the surface only lasted about 3-4 years even with the best of care. It seems it's the nature of the beast.",1573695585878,0,True

There are 10 micro screws that you screw into the case after assembling it to your phone so its as sturdy as can be.If you drop your phone it will be protected pretty well,but if you need to remove your phone from the case you have to use the special tool it came with to un-screw all 10 screws.

4.0,"I admit, I like it","I am still not ready to pay 50 bucks or more a month for an iPhone and this was the next best thing.<br /><br />PROS<br />In a case, it is pretty indestructible. I have dropped mine and had the back pop off and it come apart and yet, I snap it back together and it works like a charm.<br /><br />You can personalize it much better than the older phones<br /><br />I love the blue icon grid (used to just have green and orange and now has green and blue and the blue is AWESOME)<br /><br />Holds quite a few pictures, videos and songs<br /><br />You can customize the front grid so whatever you want is on there<br /><br />I actually like the Qwerty keyboard. I am a big fan of those and they work very well for me. I know some people hate them but I am not one of them<br /><br />Holds a charge for quite a long time<br /><br />Sets multiple alarms (my last phone didn't do that but it was pretty old)<br /><br />Great music sound<br /><br />The loud ring is really loud and the vibrate is pretty strong so you do feel it<br /><br />The notepad feature is pretty good. I use it a lot for my grocery list<br /><br />I love the fact that you can set world times so that all you have to do is click the icon and it will take you to the time of the city you are looking for. I have friends or relatives in several cities around the world and I find myself using this more than I thought I would.<br /><br />CONS<br />It is not as ""cool"" as the iPhone<br /><br />It is easy to punch a button by accident (like your voicemail)and that is super annoying<br /><br />The videos have to be put into another format to play on the Brightside and its a little annoying to put them on<br /><br />The bluetooth settings are not very good and its very hard to get it to be compatible<br /><br />It needs more fonts and needs a larger font for people who have difficulty seeing. The large font is not very large and the normal font is tiny<br /><br />You cannot set the phone so that it locks after a few minutes. This was a great safety feature on other phones and this phone does not have it and I don't know why. If it is stolen, it can be used by the thief. The security features on the iPhone are much better than this phone and the older flip phones were much better than this phone.<br /><br />The camera is awful. The pictures are dark and grainy. I have used it but it really is awful.<br /><br />It only has two languages, English and Spanish. If you wanted Russian, Hebrew, Yiddish, Chinese etc....don't go with this phone, go with another phone.<br /><br />Very hard to use it with voice prompts but it says it has those. It may be that bluetooth is very hard to set up and that is why.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />All in all. I am happy with it but in a few years when only smartphones are offered, I will have to bite the bullet and I will get an iPhone and get one and I know it will be better than this one but for now, this one is ok and as I share a service plan...I only pay $15 a month and rarely go over my minutes.",1364080624000,4,False

I got mine at Verizon Wireless and as they are little more than professional scam artists in that store, I am sure they will not be willing to help and Plantronics said ""hey ship it back to us and we can ship you a new one""...so I have to pay for the shipping.

This stand stays right where I put it, even when I adjust the arm.<br /><br />I like that this stand has a clip for the phone holder (my other one did too - that's what broke though). I'm always putting my phone in and taking it out do do something, and it's so easy with a clip compared to other stands that you have to tighten or loosen a piece around your phone.<br /><br />The colors on this stand are lovely and the build quality is good.

The clip that holds the phone is on a ball joint and easy to move around, also holds well where you position it.<br /><br />A con is the base clip is weak and slides around easily which makes the whole thing tip over in certain positions, especially if the arm goes off to the side. Clip is definitely strong enough to hold it when aligned better though, but it seems like the clip might break eventually if you adjust the arm by cranking against the base. I hold the bottom of the arm when making big adjustments to the arm or else the clip slides all over or pops off. I've got a metal wood clamp with a spring and I'll probably try to anchor it with that.<br /><br />The only other con is the clamp can press the side buttons on my phone if I'm not careful - there's no way around it because of how the clip works.

I must say that at least initially, I’m impressed with the attention to detail made in creating this product and the installation process.  I’ve never had a screen protector this complicated to install, but if you take your time, it seems like the results are definitely worth it.  They really thought through everything thoroughly, from the bubble level to the weight that goes over the fingerprint sensor.  My protector looks smooth as glass, and the fingerprint sensor seems to work fine, although I was initially worried that no amount of pressure would get it to read (turns out you’re better off not trying to press your entire fingerprint on the screen when registering it).<br /><br />The plastic film that comes pre-installed on the S10 was starting to look like crap on my device (sort of defeats the purpose of having a gorilla glass screen when you have a very easily scratched plastic protector on there).  Time will tell how this holds up, but my previous experience with glass protectors saving my actual screen from near-certain scratches has been good.  I expect this to be the same but will update my review if I find otherwise.

Completely unusable. Original Review :  I like how easy this was to apply.  (My last product actually cracked WHILE I was applying it!)  There are a few issues with it, however:  1) The instructions are written in really tiny print on the box, so I actually had to use a magnifying glass to read them!  2) There is no cutout for the front camera lens.  This didn't appear to affect the ""selfie"" function, however, so probably not a big issue if you make sure it is adhered well over the lens. 3) Most importantly, it does not register your fingerprint once installed on your phone screen.  (I didn't try to do this first, however, so maybe it would work that way, but I don't think it would.)  I personally don't use the biometric function on my phone because I don't like being forced to have a screen lock, so the lack of fingerprint capability doesn't matter to me.  If you do use a fingerprint unlock, I don't recommend this screen.  For me, however, it's just fine. Hopefully it actually protects the phone, since I do drop it occasionally, but I can't speak to that issue yet, since I just installed it.  Hope this info is helpful!",1675698321811,0,True
3.0,Needs a Built-in Screen Protector or Raised Bumper,"Poetic cases are always my go-to product for all of the phones and tablets in our home (we own at least 6 currently).  However, because the phone it was bought for (Galaxy Note 20 Ultra) has a unique CURVED screen, Poetic did not include a built-in screen protector into the design of this particular case.  Not only that, the frame that surrounds the screen is not as protective (more like cheap plastic) than we have on all of our other Poetic cases. Because of this, there really should be a raised bumper around all four sides of the phone in the event the phone is dropped face down, but there is only a slightly raised bumper at the top and the bottom.  I still love Poetic cases, but am really nervous about this one, since I drop my phone fairly frequently - - a habit I've allowed in the past in large part because of how well my other Poetic phone cases have worked.  Guess I'm just going to have to be more careful with phone!",1672090121597,0,True
3.0,WHY YOU SHOULDN'T BUY THIS PHONE,"I bought this phone SOLELY because it's the only newer phone that still has a micro-SD card slot for extra storage.  I had also had a Note 3 which lasted 17 years before we eventually retired it. (That'll NEVER happen with newer phones that are made to have to be replaced after a couple of years!). Now for a few of the reasons you should NOT get this phone:  1) THE BATTERY LIFE IS HORRENDOUS!  If you use your phone a lot, or use it for streaming or gaming, plan on having to charge it several times a day.  I actually use my phone very little compared to a lot of other people, I have it on extreme battery saver with most of my apps restricted from running in the background, and I STILL have to charge at least once a day, even though the settings tell me that I have 2.2 days of charge left.  2) AMAZON WILL NOT HONOR THEIR PREMIUM RENEWED COMMITMENT OF ONE YEAR REPLACEMENT OR REFUND--as stated clearly on the product description page!  In fact, they stated that they wouldn't even allow the 90 days that are given for lesser renewed products, only the same window for Christmas returns, which is less than 2 months!  3). It is nearly impossible to find a phone case with a built-in screen protector because of the unique CURVED screen on the phone, and the ones that are available don't work with the fingerprint reader.  Therefore, if you regularly drop your phone like I do, PLAN ON HAVING TO REPLACE YOUR PHONE ENTIRELY.  Very disappointed in this phone AND in Amazon!",1670947239983,15,True
2.0,Don't Waste Your Money on This Product!,"BOTH of these screens CRACKED when I was putting them on!  (The first one cracked, so I attempted to put on the second one and it also cracked.)  Also, the one for the camera did not come with instructions, so I attempted to put it on following the instructions for the screen protector.  There ended up being big bubbles underneath that I couldn't smooth out, and these would have definitely shown in any pictures that I took.  Not only that, I couldn't get it off my camera!  I ended up having to Google how to get tempered glass off a phone screen, and eventually got the glass off the camera.

Additionally, the kickstand is very flimsy and difficult to open and close.  Also, since the kickstand is not centered, it does not work--the phone just tips over whether in landscape (when you'd be using it most often to watch videos) OR portrait mode.

Or even just interfere in other ways I hadn't yet considered. Other phone cases have the zipper portion inside, close to the phone. I didn't like that. This one is on outside. I like that.<br /><br />Next, there are card slots that dont touch the screen. There are also some card slots that do, but there is an OPTION to just use the sets that dont touch the screen. And that portion snaps closed. It isnt just flailing open while my phone is in use. I like that-- added security. My last phone case when open, meant that the cards were exposed. Also, I had slots that touched the screen, and the cards made little scratches over time on the screen, and then once I put a screen protector on, scratches on the protector. SO this has 7 card slots that do not touch the screen at all. Then there is a panel of 3 slots that do. I dont need every slot filled, so I know I could keep the slots that are against the screen clear.<br /><br />Basically goes like this: Magnetic closer strap, zipper portion, then 7 slot card area that has snap closure, then on opposite side has 3 card slots and a pocket, then the phone area. Includes a wrist strap.<br /><br />The zipper area is spacious, but not too big, bulky. I would rather it was deep enough to be able to fold my cash in half and slide in, but that is not possible. I have to fold it further to get it in place. Just needed to be a couple millimeters wider and it would work. Oh well. There is a pocket on the slot side that touches the phone where I can simply fold the cash in half and slide it in. I like the added carrying space.<br /><br />Going back to the slots. The slot that has the clear window, also has the snap closure rivet. Be mindful of what you place there because for some reason, it makes for an extra tight fit, and it slights scrubs against what you put there. I decided to only put a credit card or ID if I have it in a paper protective sleeve. I dont want anything scratched up. Other side has the other rivet, but doesn't seem to rub anything I put there.<br /><br />Overall I like it, am pleased with it. Could be a little better in ways, but still has all that I am looking for. Adds minor bulk compared to other cases, but it suits my needs just fine. I do feel secure with it, and that is most important. Might buy another in a different color.",1638029297632,3,True
5.0,"So far so good, install directions are ok, all features work well with this","So far so good for use with my Google Pixel 6 Pro. I can use all features and functions no problem, including fingerprint reader.<br /><br />Install was ok. The video is aggravating because it plays quickly, and anytime I paused it, the written info was covered up by the playback bar. Written instructions worked out best, but I did accidentally ruin the first one because the peel back slipped. Once I tried again, all went very well. I have been using stuff like this for years, and always get it on the first try perfectly. This one threw me off a little. Just watch video on this page a few times, read directions, have patience, then have at it.<br /><br />LOVE the plug in ""guide"" and the added no slip backing (like a carpet backing) to help out this process. Plenty of wet wipes, dust wipes, dust pick up tape. Overall, a really good kit.<br /><br />I happened to order this knowing my phone was on the way. Once my phone arrived, I didnt touch it until I had this ready to use. It saved me greatly from having to clean the screen off as it comes comes covered up.<br /><br />Hopefully it does what it is supposed to do and keep my phone screen safe.

I didn't shop around; I just came right back to this brand.<br /><br />I have various bands for different needs. I like the elastic bands for times I just want a different look, and ease of fit. I prefer the regular silicone watch bands for working out, and other high activity days. But for a comfy, attractive, barely there feel especially when going out for dinner or running errands? The elastic style are a must have.

If I wanted more features, then the price goes way up. I basically knew what I needed this for, and the worked from there. Not bad for a newb. :D<br /><br />So far, I think it has been a great choice. I am happy with it. It took some getting used to as it was so new to me, but the included instructions are good. And I can come back here for more info too. I am kind of new to power banks of this size, but I needing something to keep my old tablet going (and occasionally lap top or phone). My tablet  doesn't hold a charge for long, and I am not always in a spot that has an outlet for me to charge it up. I can pack up this bank, and take it wherever I find myself working. There are plenty of additional options- USB, USB C, regular plug in. I like that I can see how much charge is left on the power bank, and I can see how far along it is when I am charging it back up. No guessing!!! That really helps me.<br /><br />It comes with a durable soft ""hard case"". It zips up, and it has a mesh pocket for keeping cord and instructions organized.

5.0,For devices with USB C ports.

There are three items in the small box. I recommend keeping the box for storage for when not in use. It has the dual port car charger that you plug into the cigarette lighter (or whatever they are called now a days), a USB C to USB C cord plus a USB C to USB cord. That is is. This item is meant for use with phones and devices that have a USB C charging port. If you have another cord- say a USB micro to USB, then it could work, but it likely won't have the rapid charge effect.<br /><br />For QUICK CHARGE: Make sure to use the USB C to USB cord if you want to QUICK CHARGE your phone. The port you want to plug into on the car charger takes the regular USB. This port is labeled QC 3.0.<br /><br />For STANDARD CHARGE: Use the USB C to USB C cord. This will charge at a regular rate. This port is labeled, PD.<br /><br />I about never drive at night, but the charger does have a low blue glow. I had tried it out to be able to say that it isn't distracting.

5.0,gorgeous deep jewel tone purple with pretty design; functional secure wallet,"I pretty much only use wallet cases like these- more protection than just a holder. I had an expensive wallet case for my 3XL, and seems they don't have one yet for the 4XL. I needed something in the meantime, so I took a chance on ordering this case. I must say, the color is outstanding. It is a deep, gorgeous purple. On my end, darker than what is pictured. Clearly purple, but almost a black purple, if that makes sense. I also love the design on the front cover and magnetic closure tab. The rear is plain yet also attractive. The optional strap that comes with it seems sturdy enough. I have it attached though I don't often find myself using it. I like that I can take it off if I find it irksome.<br /><br />The interior has 3 slots for bank cards (or whatever) as well as a longer slot for paper money. As with every wallet case I have ever had, the opening isn't long enough to just slide money into. I always have to fold it. Not a problem as I usually just carry a little extra cash, and leave my wads of money (lol) for my actual wallet.<br /><br />The magnetic closure is sturdy and solid. It grabs the case and keeps it closed. Easy to open as needed.<br /><br />Built in kick stand is basically just allowing the phone to rest horizontally on the inside cover. It works.<br /><br />I am so impressed by the color that I want the other two colors as well, just to swap out.<br /><br />The cut-out around the rear camera is perfect. Zero issues. No haziness or other obstruction.<br /><br />If you are a fan of wallet style phone cases AND use it to hold bank card in the slots, then you should also get a screen protector. I say this because on my 3XL with another wallet case, the cards began to etch the screen. I don't think it is a matter of the brand of wallet or the quality, just the reality of a hard card hitting the screen over and over. So I made sure to buy a screen protector this time around. Now if there is any scratching, it will be on the protector and not the actual phone.<br /><br />For what it is worth, I like the wallet style not so much for the wallet part, but that it adds an extra level of protection that a non wallet/cover style case offers. I just prefer to have my phone covered from all sides. The interior of the case has the part that holds onto the phone, and it does so well. But I like the wallet aspect too. I tend to just go into the store with my phone rather than bring in a purse. So... No complaints!<br /><br />No complaints whatsoever. :)<br />If I have any, I iwll be back to update<br /><br />Truly, thanks for making a nice looking, budget friendly, functional case.",1573587676182,0,True
5.0,"so far so good, fits great on 4Xl, no interference with anything","FANTASTIC (so far). I bought a flip cover wallet case for my new Google Pixel 4XL, and my experience with my 3XL and a wallet case is that the bank cards were etching the screen. Not wanting to repeat that mistake, I made a point to purchase the screen protector that I could put on the moment the phone arrived.<br /><br />The protector went on easily. Since I put it on as soon as the phone arrived, the screen hadn't any opportunity to get smudge marks or fibers on it, so I didn't need the accompanying tools to help with that. I simply eyeballed the screen protector over the screen, and let it drop gently into place. I nailed it in terms of setting it on perfectly, and I didn't have to fuss. Any bubbles that presented once I pressed down were easily pressed out.<br /><br />Prior to buying this set of screen protectors, I had asked the question to the community (or company) whether or not the material creates a haze around the front facing camera lens. No answer, but now I can answer in case anyone is wondering. See, with my 3XL any tempered glass protectors were too thick around the lens. It created a hazy halo with the front facing camera (selfies, I guess). The way the old phones were set up, the protectors had a cut out around the lens.  The cut outs were weird because the top portion of the layout on the phone was weird. They fixed that with the 4xl. Anyway, the cut outs were barely any bigger than the lens. I am a master at lining up protectors, so it wasn't a matter of failed placement, it was more a matter of design on the 3xl along with the thickness of the protector. I wanted to avoid that going forward- ie; not bother to buy the protector if it was just going to be like that again, but I went ahead and ordered it as I waited for my phone to arrive.<br /><br />Forward to everything arriving and setting everything up. The protectors fit fine, easy to put on, the protector does not surround the camera eye, so there is no risk of creating a haze (unless maybe you put it on wrong). SO much better!!<br /><br />It is still early on for use of this screen protector. I will be back to update if I find that it isn't working out the way it should.",1573586633491,0,True

I have used it with a wall charger, I have used it in a wall receptacle that has USB port, I have used it plugged into my computer. I will likely keep it in my bedroom, and get another for use at my computer. I like having the extra length to my cord as sometimes I take pics while it is plugged in. Say, I have taken pics for review purpose, then while transferring pics to computer I think of other pics I want to take. I can keep it all connected- take more pics- and be able to easily transfer my pics without taking additional steps. It is a little thing, but a big thing in terms of time saving. Of course, I could just take all the pics I need before connecting phone to computer, but that doesn't always happen.

3.0,"Cellphone arm moves too much; great idea, needs some improvement","Not bad, but not the best.<br /><br />First I will describe the product, then let you know how it can all go wrong.<br /><br />Easy to put together. Comes with directions, don't really need them.<br /><br />This is basically a lamp with a cellphone holder. The lamp is a ring with three settings: ""white, warm yellow, warm yellow + white"".  You can adjust the brightness level for any of those modes. The lamp ring can be manipulated in a few different directions. The lamp gets it power from USB only. The cord of the lamp runs freely out from back of ring, and is approximately 65"" long. There is a switch to turn it on (and adjust lamp mode and brightness) located about half way down the length (between 24""-27"" from lamp ring). The switch has 4 settings. ""Up"" & ""Down"" switches to change brightness levels, an ""on/off"" switch, and a ""mode"" switch to change between (white), (warm yellow), (warm yellow + white).<br /><br />The base of the stand has three sturdy legs that spread out fairly flat. When not in use, they can be arranged to be all folded tight together, and used supposedly as an awkward handle for self stick. The entire stand itself at full height is approximately 47"". My measurements are not exact, and I have the lamp ring in full upright position. The stand can be adjusted just by turning the tubes/poles- they drop down some as they are loosened. You can collapse all of them to create a very short table top lamp, or they can all be extended to create medium-tall lamp.<br /><br />This last part is actually what makes me kinda not like this unit. By adjusting one, it is way too easy to accidentally adjust another, so while you may want to make a section taller, but the whole thing collapses too short. You try to make it right again, and things move. All these parts do this. It is not a simple adjustment unless you get it just right, and don't move anything else. So that is annoying. Even by just moving the lamp ring, you can easily put enough pressure to loosen up one of the tubes, once again collapsing the pole and making it shorter. Same deal with the cellphone holder. There are too many moving parts and not designed to be sturdy enough to handle these adjustments without impacting the other. As a photographer and avid reviewer, I need to be able to make quick adjustments without much time or hassle. If you just need a light, or just need to adjust once in awhile--and have patience- then this will be fine for that use; pretty good really!<br /><br />Ok, now the cellphone holder. I like the tension holder. It is solid on one end, and has a sliding tension bracket with silicone grip. Not bad. It holds my Google Pixel 3xl just fine (once I take it out of case). BUT the weight of it can pull the holder down, and while the holder itself seems to do a fine job, the spot where the holder attaches to the stand is not latched on enough to to securely hold the weight, or be able to handle adjustments, or tap it for pics, etc. See,  the spot that holds the cellphone holder arm (rugged material, about 8"") to the pole of the stand is a vice style clamp. However, the poles are smooth, and while the vice parts have some traction on each side, it is not enough to firmly hold the cellphone holder in place firmly; it drags it down some. I've tried it on the pole with widest diameter down to smallest- all of them make me question its ability to stay in place. I don't know about you, but this makes me queasy to trust it to keep my expensive cellphone safe from drops.<br /><br />THAT, and if you try to make adjustment to that area, the whole thing can start collapsing on itself (see prior paragraph).<br /><br />So yeh, I love the idea of this equipment. It is something I want and need in my life- but I get frustrated with it. I will continue to use it as intended as I still need to use something. If I come up with any ideas how to deal with some of the short comings, i will share my thoughts. I will say that the overall quality of every part seem good. I am impressed with that!<br /><br />My reduction in rating is based primarily on the cellphone holder arm staying in place. Even with everything else perfectly adjusted, and behaving perfectly (I am generously considering user error), the arm of the cellphone holder dips significantly, and therefore impeded my ability to do my job/tasks.",1555089716516,0,False
5.0,Works with Google wireless charging and others,"--As soon as my husband and I each ordered us a Google Pixel 3 XL, we proceeded to search for a phone case cover. Independently we each thought the SnakeHive was the best contender of the bunch. I have used cheap phone cases in the past with success. This is not cheap, but it is still affordable for the quality. When selecting a phone case, it really comes down to what exactly you are looking for, and as for reviewing, if it met those needs.<br />--My husband wanted a folio style case as well as one that worked with the Google wireless charger. I wanted a folio style case, didn't care about the wireless charging, but definitely wanted 2-3 slots for my banking cards. He purchased the black, and I, wanting some color went with the Honey Gold.<br />--It is probably my computer, but I imagined the Honey to be more yellow. This isn't a negative, just wasn't quite what I thought. It is however, truly a Honey Gold (so the naming of the color is spot on). Reminds me of honey mustard sauce. --Soft, newbuck leather. It definitely has a soft feel, and as with any new leather, it will break in over time- both in flexibility and the surface patina. Real leather will absorb oils (from fingers) and absorb other elements of the environment. This is what gives the leather character. Expect your phone case to exhibit these changes over time.; especially a sheen around edges and magnetic clasp. Some people may decide on some additional leather care products.<br />--The stitching is solid and even.<br />--The magnetic clasp is strong, and accommodates additional thickness from use of card and money slots.<br />--3 horizontal card slots, with a full vertical opening to stash cash or receipts.<br />--Cut outs are perfect. The cut outs do not interfere with anything, including back facing camera (I had purchased a screen cover that while the cutouts were good, and the placement was perfect, it created a haze on the resulting picture. This case does not create that effect. It is well done!!)<br />--It doesn't have a special viewing stand, but due to slight fold in rear part of case, it acts as one simply by putting phone into horizontal position.<br />--This case WORKS with wireless charging units, both the Google Pixel wireless charging unit as well as some cheapies purchased on the side.<br />--I have yet to drop my phone, but so far it seems pretty secure in the case, including the rubberized phone holder - it feels secure, and meets up directly with surface of phone.<br />-- My husband does not care for the magnetic clasp. He has to be in and out of his phone many times throughout the day at work, and does not care to have to use two hands basically to get into it, without it feeling clunky. It can be done, but he found that he prefers the feel of a non clasp case, and has since found something else he likes (now I own a black case and my Honey gold case).<br />--I find that the security that the magnetic clasp adds to the safety of the phone (and bank cards, etc) is a great feature. For all the time I spend on my phone (which is a lot, as I definitely use social media and spend time writing reviews), I don't find it too intrusive. I have found it helpful at times when I have been in an odd position trying to get a selfie (usually when trying to get one with one of my dogs or cats), and have used the clasp as stability for my fingers. I guess this is preference thing.<br />In summation, I really see no complaints worthy of down rating this product. It appears to be as described, with the ability to protect the product and be functional. It works with wireless charger, which many of the cases for the Pixel 3 XL do not, or are far and few in between at time of searching for a phone case. Other aspects are simply a matter of preference.<br /><br />Edit 10/2019: Added pics of case that I just took. Also wanted to add that I have dropped phone many times, this case has kept my phone safe. Case color definitely deepens over time, great addition of character. It is a deep caramel brown now. If you use it to store credit cards in the slits, be sure to have a screen shield, or risk scratching phone screen. Other than that, it's holding up well!",1553112725508,3,True
2.0,Creates haze on front facing camera pics (selfies),"EDIT: Well I put this screen protector on same day I got my Pixel 3 XL, and followed up with a review. I had it at 5 stars.  I had written that I would be back to edit if there were any issues. I'm back. The issue is that the holes on the  front facing lense create a halo that is evident when taking a ""selfie"". I thought it was something in my camera settings when it occurred to me that it could be the protector. I hated taking it off to check, but that was it. It isn't a matter of alignment as I couldn't get it any more perfect. I had given my husband one to use, and asked him about what I saw. When testing his camera in selfie mode, sure enough there was a haze there too. Bummer! I thought it a nice protector. My husband said his about came off when he hit it on something. So that's disturbing. So either cut outs needs to be bigger, or material around that section thinner, as the thickness is getting picked up by camera. I'm sorry to have to drop rating from original 5 stars to 2. If I never used the front facing camera, that would be one thing, but since I do, I do not want the end result with a significant haze around the picture. Right now it is worthless to me, unfortunately.  All other info in my review stays the same.<br /><br />No complaints or issues so far. Easy, perfect fit. Nice material, feels like it will protect my Google Pixel 3xl from scratches. I can navigate without hindrance from the protector material. Fair budget friendly price. Came with a link to video instructions. I did not view that prior to installation. As soon as I took my brand new Pixel out of the box I put this protector on before any dust or smudges occurred. Everything lines up perfectly. The box came with 3 protectors, some dust and cleansing wipes, a guard frame as well as guides and a tool to smooth out trapped air. I have only had it a couple of days so i will return to adjust review as needed.",1551040786601,1,True
1.0,"Cute but disposable. I really wanted to like this product, but..","Pros:<br /> Easy to use. I like that I didn't have to unscrew anything to make the band go on. Just pop your Blaze out, and pop this in through the back. Feels secure, I've never worried about my Blaze slipping out. Band buckle is secure too.<br /><br />However.. CONS:<br />Color wears off. Ive had two designs from this company. I don't switch them out every day, but instead wear them day in and day out for several weeks. One had a black background with silver. The silver wore away in spots, leaving me with noticeable black areas. Looks shabby now. I gave it a pass and bought another design, the one I am reviewing now. This design that I am reviewing in particular is a white base with the additional colors on top (pink, green, black). So when those colors began to wear away, the white showed through. Again, making it look shabby.<br /><br />Additionally, and the WORST part of it, is that it didn't take much for the band to rip. Now this made me angry. That could have been the loss of an expensive piece of technology.  It tore right across the band. That was it for me.<br /><br />Too bad the cons outweighed the pros. I really wanted to like this product. I love all the cute designs and overall ease of swapping out. But when that band ripped, and of course with each one having their colors wear away.. meh.",1494178393000,2,True
5.0,"Used daily, 21 months later this wallet is still in perfect condition","I bought this wallet nearly two years ago. I use it every day. There hasn't been another wallet that has caught my attention, nor have I needed another one as this one had been near perfect for the entire time I have been using it. It is a sturdy, well constructed wallet that holds more than it needs to and feels secure to use. Cleans easily. Zippers stay shut, the card holders are deep enough to hold cards. The wallet is wide enough to carry cash and checks without folding them. I love the internal coin zip pocket. I can stick a pen, lip gloss, pack of sticky notes, and a few other slim doo-dads in center zipped area. Despite it having the ability to hold a lot of little extras, it is not bulky. At all. I can stick my cell phone in there so long as it doesn't have a thick case (which is why I originally ordered it so many moons ago). Wristlet is secure.<br /><br /> I'm reviewing it now because I am interested in buying a wallet that has a cross body strap. I don't want to use it in that way every time, but occasionally I want to just take my wallet into a store and not an entire purse. But want to emphasize that the wristlet on this wallet is very well made and super sturdy, and works well enough for semi hands free shopping/errand running. Nothing on this wallet has ever made me question the integrity of the materials. It is solid!<br /><br />However, now that I am looking for one with a cross body strap, I am sad to move out of this wallet and into something else. So now I am looking at the exact same company (Belfen/Befen) for something that will be similar to this wallet and yet have a cross body strap. Way to go Belfen/Befen for making something of quality that has made me want to purchase from you again. Hope my next one is as good as this one.",1494174599000,4,True
5.0,"Sounds good, feels good, looks good. So easy to use!","I LOVE this head set. I HAD a retro cordless/blue-tooth style, but it is a pain to keep charged, remember to have it connected, sometimes it doesn't connect, and often doesn't have good sound quality for either party. I was bummed, since I really like the idea of conversing with a head set reminiscent of a traditional phone. I find them comfortable to talk into, and wanted the same feel for my cellphone.<br /><br />When I came across this corded product, I decided to give it a try. I AM SO GLAD THAT I DID! It just plugs into the cellphone. No need to have the units read each other. No charging. The phone can be answered through a button on the head set, or as normal on the cellphone. Sound quality is good, if not better, for both parties. The head set is comfortable, and the cord is adequately long enough. Same size and feel of a real telephone piece. I usually hate talking on my cellphone, but this makes a world of difference.  I have only used this at home, but I am not against using it out in public if desired.<br /><br />If this looks like something you would enjoy using, I recommend it.",1421092955000,0,True

It has a clear piece of plastic that covers the screen and protects it from scratches. I have not EVER liked the ones that you stick to the screen, like this one has. Good luck getting it on without a finger print or a speck of dust getting on it while installing it. Also, the rubber feels super cheap and flimsy compared to mine. The only reason I chose this one was because she wanted one in green, and the one I ordered didn't come in green. So I took a chance. For the cost, it's not a huge deal but my experience with those sticky screen protectors has been that eventually, they lose their stick and you get bubbles that are impossible to get rid of.

3.0,Sturdy but silly design flaws.,"12/30/2019 - UPDATE: Price dropped from $29.99 to $19.99. They won't refund the difference, but I guess at $19.99 the product is slightly closer to being what it is actually worth. So there is that. But still, a phone holder that doesn't really hold the phone securely? Meh, get the WeatherTech one instead.<br /><br />The cup part seems fine enough. It’s not going to tip over or anything. It looks good and serves the purpose. HOWEVER, the phone holder itself doesn’t “click” into the top of the gooseneck. So if you bump it, it’s going to drop your phone. It’s easy enough to glue the two pieces together though and solve that problem. It just seems like a silly design. Second complaint is that the plastic tabs that insert into the gooseneck or tiny bits of plastic. It’s pretty much 2020, and we STILL have not learned not to make stress points out of tiny plastic??? Finally, if you have an iPhone 6s in an Otter case, it WILL fit, but not snugly. This could have easily been solved by making the side grips flat instead of curved. Or rather than having a button to release the grips, have a lock of some sort. Overall, I think it is overpriced based on the obvious flaws. I wouldn’t pay more than $15 for this in hindsight unless they address these issues.",1577503830486,2,True

Sometimes, if my slots are full and I've a small grip of money (cuz I be small grippin people), I have to adjust and massage crap to be sure the magnet hits in the right spot to be sure it closes.<br /><br />A preference would be to have my ID window separate from the card slots.",1565134477235,0,True
3.0,My 1st impressions (1 week in),"Pros:<br />*Seems very sturdy. Not real leather but I didn't pay for real leather.<br />*Snaps and magnets seem strong.<br />*I'm able to handle my phone without it slipping out of my hand because the removable case is not slippery.<br />*The stylus is handy and works well. It's nice to be able to walk around with 1 clutch vs a wallet and a phone case.<br />*There are a lot of slots for storage with a huge clear panel for your license.<br /><br />Con:<br />*The finger activated security thingy opening on the back of the case is too small; so you have to take the removable case off to use this option. The potential for issue if you don't immidiately replace the case on the magnets is a bit concerning.<br />*It's a little bulkier than I expected. I find myself removing the case from the wallet portion often for easier handling - a thing I dont want to do when I'm out of the house.<br />*The charger port is also too small. I have to lift the phone out of the removable case to charge the phone. Annoying: I'm concerned about the potential for stretching the case over time and my phone falling out.<br />*There is no flip stand so if I want to watch videos on my phone, I have to prop my phone against whatever random object might be nearby.<br />*I don't know the name of the technology, but ive had phone cases that automatically sent the phone into sleep mode when I closed the case. This one doesn't have that tech so I need to make sure I send my phone to sleep before I close the case.<br /><br />I don't think I'll order this case again. However, I've only had it for about a week now. Perhaps my cons won't be a big deal over time.",1522774029670,0,True
3.0,"Accessories are fine, cover is not my favorite...","I purchased this package because it came with a lot of accessories and I needed a cover for my phone. ...at least I got accessories... I like that it comes with a stylus. It would be nice if the cover had some place for it to attach. Unfortunately, the cover and magnet strength is so sub par, just booking it on the cover isn't the best option. I believe damage will occur at some point...<br /><br />The cover is hard thin plastic - not leather & not leather look. I'm on Amazon now looking for a replacement cover. As others mentioned, the finger print option doesn't work. This was no big deal for me however. Get this for the accessories and you'll be happy. If you're a clutz, get a different cover that offers more protection. The magnet closure doesn't provide a secure close. Unfortunately, if you bend the cover backwards while holding the phone (for a more secure grip) unlike real leather, this act will mess with the grip of the magnet. Though the flap closes back, it won't grip quite as flat.<br /><br />Meh... It'll do until I find the right cover...",1450306211000,3,True

4.0,It’s good,"Looks just as pictured. The only issue I have with it is that the screen plastic doesn’t lay flush with the screen. In certain places it bows up which cause issues when typing. For me, the screen bows on the right part of the key board so when I need to use “L” or “M” or delete button I have to tap it several times, 4+ , for the screen to register that I’m trying to use that key. If I use swipe to text it’s different and works fine but it’s super annoying to have to type a key several types. I do also have a privacy screen protector on my screen so maybe with that and the built in screen plastic of the case it maybe too thick to type normally. I’m not sure. I’ve used my phone without this case but with the privacy screen and works as it should. With the case and the built in screen protector errors happen a lot and it’s frustrating.

5.0,This gimbal is very nimble.,"Hotel family. What I like about this gimbal is the price the price is really came down from when I bought my first gimbal.

I believe neodymium magnets are inside this holder.<br />* Ball joint articulation on both ends of the holder. This is a unique design. Most holders only feature articulation on one end.<br />* Ball joint movement is nice and rigid. You don't want it loose.

So this gets the job done.<br />* Three metal plates are included for you to adhere to cases, or surfaces that are not metal.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Surprising lightweight. I was expecting something heavy duty. The main round ends that houses the magnets seem to be chrome plated plastic. If it's not plastic, it's very lightweight aluminum.

However, for the strongest bond, the magnetic surface of your mount should be equal in size or greater than this holder.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Extremely difficult to open the ring without finger nails. Opposite of the hinge is a notch that can help you pry out the ring. I took close-up picture of this for you. However, you won't be able to get it out if your finger nails are freshly clipped. LOL! The notch was cut too shallow. You need a credit card, a toothpick, anything flat to dig in and pry it out.<br /><br />For the quality you're getting at this price, this would have been 5-Stars, but I'm docking 2 star for the ring being extremely difficult to pry out. To need a tool to pry out the ring is such an inconvenience. I won't be using it.",1655279124675,0,False

Considering how big phones have gotten, 3.3"" is cutting it really close. My Pixel 6 Pro along with its case barely made it.

This is actually also a bad point, more on this below.<br />* Peak Design is a reputable company that makes some great stuff.<br />* If your car has a magnetic mount, this wallet will stick to it along with the phone. I discuss this in my video.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Though the magnetism is strong, the wallet is longer than the PD adapter. So the bottom half of the wallet can easily pivot since it's not sticking to anything. So imagine removing the phone and wallet out of your pocket, and the bottom of the wallet brushes against your hip or something, it can pivot and fall off the phone case. So you have to be careful with this. Ironically, this ability to pivot is actually a good thing when it comes to using the wallet as a kickstand. That is how you go from portrait to landscape easily. You just pivot/twist the wallet.<br />* Cards DO NOT cascade nicely like the stock photos.<br />* At 6 cards or more, there is friction when pushing closing the cards, so you'll have to support the bottom of the wallet when pushing the cards down, otherwise, you will push the wallet right off the phone, and people in line will stare at you.

5.0,A better looking alternative to ugly magsafe round ring adapters...,"THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* Aesthetically, a much nicer solution than round metal rings. If you already have a magsafe case, then you do not need this adapter to use the PD line of accessories. A magsafe case has built in metal ring in the back of it. You can also buy metal rings to stick to the back of any case to turn it into a ""magsafe"" case. But again, aesthetically, this is better than a round metal ring.<br />* The 3M on the back of this adapter is the real deal. Perhaps it sticks well because the entire back is 3M. The 3M for metal rings are terrible. I had a magnetic charger yank off the metal ring cause the adhesion was so weak. I think it has to do with the nature of the shape, a round adhesion ring is hollow in the middle, so it's weak.<br />* I have a Google Pixel 6 Pro, and wireless charging was not an issue with this adapter. That was my main concern. I wondered if the thickness of the case, plus the thickness of this adapter would make wireless charging ineffective.

It is simply A.I. witchcraft and it just works. I have no clue how or why it works, it just does.<br />* Some of these holders can make a motor noise that you cannot hear, but your camera may record it, and you'll hear it when you replay your video. I've seen people say they get motor noise with this exact model. However, that hasn't been my experience at all. I don't know if the phone you use has anything to do with it, but I use a Google Pixel 6 Pro, and I don't get any motor noise in my videos. This thing has been perfect.<br /><br />HOW TO OPERATE:<br />-----------------------<br />* Charge it, or keep it connected to a power source and use immediately.<br />* Place your phone on it.<br />* Secure it with the onboard tightening knob.<br />* Hold power button for 3 seconds. It will blink red. Now if you skip the manual, this is where you get confused because it simply shuts itself off. I admit, I didn't read the manual. LOL! Anyway, after turning it on and seeing it blink red, you need to face the camera and make an OK sign with your fingers. The led turns green and it starts tracking you. Again, no wifi, no bluetooth, just an OK sign with your fingers. LOL! Simply amazing.<br />* To pause the tracking, Give it an ""OPEN PALM"" sign like you're about to give it a high five.

Voila.. you now have a magsafe case.<br />* Not just limited to iPhones. You can use this on virtually any case for any phone. I will be using this with my Pixel 6 Pro.<br />* Built in kick stand/ring holder.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Adds bulk to your phone. But it is detachable at any moment.

I think since I've gotten this case, they've changed their wording to bumper, which is more accurate.<br />* When I got this, I was very disappointed because I thought I didn't have to shop for a screen.

Unfortunately, the kick-stand is a separate piece that will stick your case via double sided tape. How elegant for your $1000 phone. LOL! Usually built in kick-stands are flush with the case when closed. This double sided tape kick-stand won't be flush.

I just wanted the four batteries inside to serve as back-up to some of my light sabers, but they can't even serve that function because they're made shorter than the ones used in light sabers.<br />* The case is very cheap. Only 3.6 ounces without the batteries.<br />* The case is also difficult to open, you'll break it at some point down the line.<br />* The batteries loosely fit inside. Have you ever used a portable battery bank that jiggles or moves around inside? LOL! I haven't, and I'm not about to start.<br />* I had only put in two batteries when I saw the springs heat up RED. I guess I must have pushed the power button on the side by accident. I guess there is no built in safety measure where it doesn't turn on unless all batteries are installed, or compartment closed.

4.0,Nice quality goggle with comfortable padding...,"If you've ever come across VR videos on YT and wonder what's it like, then this is what you need to find out.  But remember that on certain VR videos on YT, at least the good ones that are 360 immersive, you need to click the GOGGLE icon in the Youtube video itself. Because when you start playing a Youtube VR video, it assumes you do not have a google, and so the default is non-VR. You need to change it to VR by hitting goggle icon. Around this price point, some goggles come with a button so you can make selections within they YT app without having to remove your phone, but this goggle doesn't have such button. The padding around the eyes are adequate and comfortable. Overall, I'll subtract 1 start because it's missing a feature others have at this price point.",1602039143723,0,False

This box has an inner dimension of 7.3 x 3.5 x 2.1, making it deep enough for your phones with cases as well as odd shapes such as your keys. The box has a smooth look with rounded corners. It looks like a high end Samsung accessory. It has wireless charging on top of the lid which worked even when my iphone had a case on it.

5.0,Go ahead and satisfy your curiosity...,"I always see VR videos on Youtube and I've been curious for the longest time. I'm not a gamer, so I can't attest to that yet. But for VR videos on Youtube, this is pretty neat. At first, I thought it didn't work. I had to close one eye to be focused, and no matter how I adjusted the settings on the goggles, nothing worked. Then I realize that you have to click the GOGGLE icon in the Youtube video itself. When you start playing a Youtube VR video, it assumes you do not have a google, and so the default is non-VR. You need to change it to VR, then you'll see the video split into two. Now when you insert into the goggle, you get VR! There is also a button under the mask that allows you to move a little cursor around, but so far, the only thing you can do is stop or pause the video. So unfortunately, you cannot control the entire youtube app. But that's not an issue with the goggle, I believe the onus would be on Youtube to make the app goggle friendly. So currently, you have to remove phone to change volume, to change video or search, or you can simply allow the next video to play. Fortunately, taking out the phone is simple, you can just reach on top of the headset and press the tab. No need to remove headset every-time you need access to your phone.

For purposes of this review, I used this headset with my iPhone 6s.<br /><br /> Pros: It has a rugged design, but is light weight and extremely comfortable to wear. In the box you receive the headset, 2 wind socks, 2 spare rubber ear pieces, a spare ear clip, and a charging cord. The headset stayed in place well, even while doing some light manual labor. Incoming sound was clear and easy to understand. The controls are simple to work.<br /><br /> Cons: Outgoing transmissions sound tinny and have a slight echo to the person on the other end of the call. The battery life is short. If used moderately heavy, it will not last an 8 hour work day. The charging cord is very short. You have to download and install an App on your phone in order to use this headset. It is the first time I have seen that. The App also contains a locator feature to find your headset and digital manuals.<br /><br /> Summary: While this headset is very comfortable to wear and sounds good on my end, it may not be good for those with whom you are talking. The short battery life means you will have to charge it mid day. Having to use space on the phone for a separate App to use the device is also a downer for me.

5.0,Compact and Sturdy Tripod,This is an excellent tripod that folds down to about the size of a standard thermos. It comes with a Bluetooth remote control that you can use to operate the shutter on your phone. I was able to connect to my Galaxy S7 with no problems and it didn't require downloading an app (although there is an app available).<br /><br />The tripod features a standard bolt thread that is mounted on a platform that can be removed. The bolt thread is likely to fit most cameras. The tripod also includes a cell phone mount that can be adjusted to fit most cell phones.<br /><br />The legs are easy to adjust and they each feature three locking latches. This is an effective and sturdy tripod that's well-designed and easy to to use.,1665853621066,0,False
5.0,Very Nice Power Bank,This power bank is a very convenient size. It's just a little bigger than a standard deck of cards and fits easily into any pocket. The exterior has a nice surface that is ridged and easy to grip. There is a small button on to the top which sits next to the ports. The button can be pressed to get a reading on the charge level. The power bank uses a USB-C cable to charge and has two standard USB ports. A charging cable is included so you have everything you need. This is a very nice power bank.,1606846928460,0,False
5.0,Great Phone Holder,"This is a very simple phone holder that is intuitive to use. It consists of a clip which inserts into your car's air vent. There are arms on either side of the holder which keep your phone in place. You only have to set your phone against the back and push the arms closed. To release the phone, there is a button on the side. I have a Galaxy S7 with a case and this holder works great.",1590936137871,0,False
5.0,Convenient Device,"We live in an era of digital devices that always seem to need to be running low on batteries. Your tablets, fitness watches, cell phones, and headphones all need to be recharged and it never seems like there are enough ports to plug them all in. This is a nice charging dock that provides you with 5 USB ports to help facilitate your charging needs. The dock does not come with any USB cables, but that is okay because most of us have a drawer of extra cables somewhere in our homes. The power plug detaches from this dock so you can conveniently thread the cable through the power hole at your work desk.<br /><br />Placing a few convenient charging docks like this throughout your home ensures that nobody will ever unplug your phone so that they can charge theirs. It is a great, convenient device that works perfectly.",1580267124234,1,False
4.0,Works Well,"I got this product because the football games aren't always available on the local television channels and I am occasionally forced to watch them on my cell phone. The product is cleverly designed with wooden components that support the enlarging lens, and make a stand for your phone. When you have finished watching you lay the lens flat, and unroll the stand so it acts as a protective covering for the lens. When flat, the product is about the size of a standard notebook.<br /><br />The lens makes the phone image considerably larger, although the resulting image doesn't completely fill the lens surface. Still, I find it much more comfortable to watch an image that is two or three times bigger than a standard cell phone. This is a great travel item and will serve to keep kids entertained on the go. Good product.",1580262575698,0,False
5.0,A Convenient Charging Solution,"These days everyone has at least one and probably multiple electronic devices that need regular charging. This tray allows you to establish an organized charging station so that you can recharge multiple devices at the same time. The tray has six USB ports and comes with six small cables. If you get the wrong cables, there is a notice on the instruction manual that you can write the manufacturer and they will send you free cables. You can also use the cables that you already own.<br /><br />The tray has plastic dividers that easily snap in place which you can add or remove at your convenience. They are wide enough to accommodate phones and tablets even if your devices have thin to moderate sized cases. If you have a very large case you can either remove the dividers, or lay your device down beside the station.<br /><br />This is a very practical tray, but I don't feel it is ideal for travel because you'd have to remove all the trays to ensure they don't break during transport. It is perfect for a home or office. The dividers light up blue when the device is plugged in and charging, and there's even an on/off switch at the back (although we just keep ours on). If you've ever gotten into an argument because somebody unplugged your device to charge their own, this is the product for you. It provides you with an instant and well-organized charging station.",1576178952226,1,False
3.0,Pretty Good but Wears Out fast,"This is a pretty decent cell phone case, but there are a couple of problems. First of all, the plastic ID case on the interior is probably going to be too small for your ID. I could get mine to fit in, but it just barely closes and the placement of the image within the framing isn't ideal.<br /><br />Second, there is a credit card slot on the front that is very tight. I almost bent my card in half trying to get it in there the first time. After a few weeks, it stretched, and then developed about a half inch tear on the side of the case.<br /><br />I like the design, and the case stays out of the line of the camera, but a little more durability would have been preferable.",1566833429689,0,True
5.0,Good Cables,It's nice to have some extra cables. I have a strip outlet with USB ports so I just leave these plugged in as a charging station all the time. These have kind of a flexible fabric covering so they hold up a little better than typical plastic covered cables.<br /><br />I received a free sample in exchange for an honest review.,1449587533000,0,False
5.0,Great Product,"This is a great product. I stuck mine to my windshield rather than my dashboard just because it seemed like I could get a better fixture point. It sits on there upside down from the product image, but it holds the phone exactly the same. I use this for listening to podcasts on my cell phone while I drive. I use a Blackberry Q10 and my wife uses a Galaxy S5. Both of these phones fit in the holder and can be set in place or removed with one hand. Also, it is a solid mount for anything from smooth roads to gravel. Highly recommended product.",1428359174000,0,False
4.0,Be Blackberry...Don’t Be Apple,"It took me about a month to decide whether I wanted the Blackberry Q10 or the Samsung Galaxy S4.  Eventually I went to the local Verizon store to actually handle both units and that made the decision quite a bit easier.  I’m a keyboard person, so I was very much inclined to the Blackberry.  I’d owned two prior Blackberries, and didn’t feel like learning how to use a different phone.  Actually handling the phone showed me that the Q10 is exactly what I wanted it to be: a miniature computer that I can actually do work on (as opposed to a miniature DVD player that I can fritter away hours with playing games and watching movies).  After handling the two units, I made up my mind to go with the Q10, and ordered one from Amazon because they were $130 cheaper than my local store (I’ll buy local, but you have to be closer than $130 in price).<br /><br />The unit arrived promptly in the mail and I had to go through the process of switching over my account.  This all went relatively easily, but I had a problem getting my contact information on the Q10.  Apparently the Q10 uses an operating system that is incompatible with the Curve 9370 which I had been using.  Eventually I got it to work, but I couldn’t walk you through the process.<br /><br />I decided to wait a week before I wrote a review because I knew I would be frustrated as I got used to the new phone.  That little snafu with the contact list would have dropped my rating a star all in itself.  There are some quirks that you have to work around which take about a week to familiarize yourself with.  Once you get used to it, it’s an effective phone.  Here are some areas that need to be discussed:<br /><br />Keyboard:<br />Let’s face it, this is why we buy a Blackberry.  The Q10 boasts the “best keyboard available on any smartphone” and after using it I am inclined to agree.  At first, I thought the 9370 had a better keyboard.  The buttons are more rounded and it feels more precise.  But it’s just a matter of getting used to the Q10.  The whole unit is a little bigger and this keyboard works just fine.<br /><br />Touch screen vs track pad:<br />Half the reason I prefer a keyboard is that I seem to have big, fat fingers that don’t access the correct thing on a touch screen EVER!  I always get the item immediately above or below the item I actually wanted.  I had gotten used to the 9370 track pad because it allowed you to make your selections but never forced you to cover up your screen with your finger.  Plus, there are directional buttons on the 9370 that allow for a bit more precision when you’re correcting a text.  However, the Q10 has a feature where you can place a cursor on your text and then slide it to the left and right which is effective for making corrections.  It isn’t quite as good or precise as the directional buttons, but it is effective enough.  I’m getting used to the touch screen and it has some advantages.<br /><br />Constant Swiping:<br />The interface for the Q10 is really where it shows a bit of “iphone envy.”  I don’t know what the deal is in our society today that instills people with an obsessive need to stroke their phone.  Getting the Q10 to do something is the equivalent of petting a cat, and this is probably my biggest gripe with the unit.  With the 9370, for example, you’d see a flashing light that indicated a message, hit the unlock button, and scroll to the text message icon.  Boom!  With the Q10 there are a couple extra steps.  When you see the flashing “message” light you have to 1. unlock the unit by pushing the button on the top 2. swipe away the initial screen (bottom to top swipe) 3. go to the hub (or go to the text message icon) 4. open the message.  It doesn’t seem like much, but it’s a couple extra steps that you have to perform every...single...time.  The whole sequence is the type of thing that is convenient for showing off the unit in a show room, but gets annoying during actual use.<br /><br />General Interface Irritations:<br />You have to learn a couple swipes just to make this unit work, swipes that start off screen and then go in various directions.  For example, to close an app you have to do a bottom to top swipe that minimizes the app where you can just close it (ironically, iphone has a BUTTON for performing this same feature).  Inside apps, a top to bottom swipe will open up options menu.  There are also menus that appear from right to left swipes and left to right.  The lack of symmetry kind of irritates me.  You have to think a little bit too much about which direction you have to swipe to get what you want.<br /><br />The Hub:<br />I’m not too excited about the hub.  To get to it you have to swipe all the way to the left to access a vertical menu that connects you with all your social media and email stuff.  However, this tool is a little too rigid in my opinion.  For example, I have 3 different Facebook accounts that I use for various businesses, but there is no option for installing 3 different Facebook accounts onto your phone.  I used to be able to just log in and out with my 9370, but that’s inconvenient on the Q10 because every time you log into Facebook with the app it wants to download all your contact information onto your phone (I don’t want the names of 5000 people I only casually known on my phone).  Sure, all you have to do is disable the “download contacts” feature, but it’s annoying to have to do it every...single...time.  This is the kind of thing that drives me nuts about Apple (and why I won’t buy Apple products): the fact that the units are specifically programmed ONLY to be used a certain way.  If I’m going to buy a device it’s MY tool and I want to be able to use it however I want.  Reoccurring automatic prompts for absurd procedures do not help me.  Programmers sitting in little cubicles thousands of miles away cannot conceive of how I want to use my device.  Don’t be so “helpful” just sit there, shut up, and do what you’re told.  If I wanted to be told what to do, I’d buy an Apple product.<br /><br />The Camera:<br />Ok, the thing that annoys me about all cell phones is that the cameras are always mediocre.  When is Olympus or Cannon going to make a camera which is also a cell phone.  To make a good camera you need a big lens!  These tiny little cell phone lenses are terrible.  Also, the lens should be in the middle of the phone for stability, and there should be a button on the edge of the unit for taking a photo.  Also, I’d like a button that instantly called up the camera (the 9370 had this) rather than have to swipe through a dozen redundant screens while the object I was trying to photograph scampers off into the woods.  Get rid of the rear facing lens (you’ll use that twice) and give me a solid camera body with the cell phone functions.  That’s how you get ahead of Apple Blackberry!  Not with a stupid feature that allows you to “rewind” a group photo so everyone is smiling.<br /><br />Apps:<br />No kindle app and the .pdf readers are pretty much terrible for what I need them for.  I’ve downloaded a couple, they’re garbage.  However, there are a couple nice camera apps, one even has a tilt shift feature that’s kind of nice.  If only this took real pictures.<br /><br />All that being said, I have started to like this phone.  It is very much a portable office unit, although it still seems a little harder to navigate than the 9370.  Blackberry is on the right track with this, but they need to eliminate the clunky interface and produce a top of the market camera before they can really compete with the other phones on the market.  I think there’s still room for Blackberry out there, but they have to be Blackberry and not succumb to Apple envy.",1392828328000,9,True
4.0,Really nice phone holder! Can also clip to other things!,"Currently I have mine clipped to my wall shelf by my bed so I can watch videos at bed time to wind down. The clip works really well and it has several joints making it to where you can easily adjust the angle to anywhere you need, I'm very impressed with that!<br /><br />I have a Sony Xperia 5 ii in a case and it's a slender and narrow phone but this mount still holds it very well! My one concern is the top silver pivot ball, some reason they made it to where the little round part on top of that loosely spins and there's no adjustments to tighten that. I'm thinking when I hit bumps in the car, it'll cause it to just flop back and forth... But I'll test it in the car and come back to update you on it later. Overall it's not a deal breaker if it does move around, I can put a dab of super glue on the moving part and it'd fix it easily. Even with that, this is the nicest phone mount I've come across!",1676710748632,0,False

5.0,Make sure you have a compatible phone case for this that it'll stick to!,"I didn't know how this attached really and thought like some of the things out there, it'd have a metal disc or magnet to put inside of my phone case. (it didn't) They didn't advertise that it did so that's all on me for not understanding. It'd be a nice future addition though as the metal disc in my phone case that I use for my car mount, some reason it doesn't stick well to this battery pack. Like it barely sticks at all. But the magnet in my car- the phone case sticks to it extremely well for some reason. So just know you have to have the right sorta phone case if you want to attach this to your phone.<br /><br />Battery wise- it came completely dead so I charged it up and it works well/ has a decent lifespan to it.

5.0,"AMAZING rugged phone, night vision camera works in pitch black! Loud speaker kind of muffled","SO I got this thinking I can ditch my little bluetooth speaker I use outside and SURE you can, this thing gets PLENTY loud. You can turn it on and hear it all thru a room like a stereo almost. But it's muffled kind of... I am willing to bet this has something to do with it being rugged and waterproof. Even a cheap little bluetooth speaker has better clarity than this but it DOES have plenty of sound and being waterproof is pretty amazing. I think this would be a fantastic phone for any trades person, it's very durable feeling and seems very well made.<br /><br />The night vision camera wowed me, I went into a room that was pitch black and took a couple pictures and could see everything in the room! You'd be able to see faces okay but pictures are kind of odd, I have a big curtain with a printed beach scene across my bedroom window and the whole curtain shows on the night cam as just a grey curtain, you don't see any outlines of the scenery on the huge mural... I'm not sure how all of that works and it shouldn't be a deal breaker, just an observation that some things might not pick up in night mode is all. I'm still very impressed with the night mode cam and even if I don't use this for my main phone, I'll probably keep the phone around just for the night cam feature! Take some neat shots of animals at night and such...<br /><br />SO using the apps and everything on the phone- it's very responsive, not sluggish at all. The camera takes decent pics during daytime too and good video too. I honestly have no real complaints about this cool phone other than the loud speaker and I think it'd be hard to make a phone at this decent price point to be rugged and waterproof AND have a perfect sounding loud speaker. I don't think that phone exists. SO it's a trade off, a little clarity for it being rugged. Definitely a well made phone as a plumber's son I can say this phone will come in handy for trades people and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone!",1663988170238,5,False

3.0,Works (with quirks),"So downloading the app and pairing it was EASY. This isn't that big and is light which is nice. It does work to find my keys from the app but with quirks sadly. One of them being you have to open the app and wait for it to load (slowly) and eventually it has pair with the keychain again each time for some reason. Once it finally pairs again, the key icon in the app lights up and you can click it to make your keys start beeping. It works at pretty far range versus the old beeping keychains that were non bluetooth. The other annoyance I have is this claimed you could click the keychain to find your phone... That worked ONCE and never again using my android phone and it's on a current android version so I dunno what's going on.<br /><br />Overall it works but it's slow and buggy sadly.

5.0,AMAZING phone!,"Was taken back at first by the slenderness of this but after using it a while and then using a friend's phone, their phones now seem fat. This one fits in the average hand much better! The fingerprint reader works well. The video quality on this is fantastic and the 120 refresh rate is absolutely a great selling point and why I grabbed it! The slow-motion 4k video is another feature that I love and works amazingly! It's been truly fun playing with the cameras on this! That being said, the front-facing camera is garbage and just almost unusable. I don't know what's going on but the picture is really blurry and grainy on the front-facing cam. The lens is perfectly clean so it's not anything like that.<br /><br />Call quality is great. Very clear audio there and the speakerphone gets plenty loud. The speakers for watching videos/ listening to music are really good and get pretty loud which is nice! The clarity and quality for those speakers are pretty impressive.<br /><br />Phone is very responsive and opens apps quickly. I did have a very annoying glitch going with the facebook messenger and this phone for some reason. The messenger was trying to put things in what it called bubbles and this constantly froze the keyboard no matter what I did. I restarted the phone multiple times, each time I get the same result trying to use messenger- phone freaking out and freezing up the keyboard. I found some way to turn off the bubble thing on the messenger and it stopped this issue. Other than that messenger issue, the phone runs flawlessly and I've had no other problems!<br /><br />I am on 5G with this phone which was a nice surprise! Overall this is an extremely impressive phone! Would I have paid this full price myself? Probably not. I feel like this phone should be a bit cheaper but then again it is pretty new, it might drop in price over time. Overall I love and recommend this phone! I initially didn't know if I'd keep it after reviewing it as I have Motorola I love but this phone is so great that I am definitely going to hold onto it!<br /><br />A minor annoyance is the lack of cases for this.

4.0,Light weight portable battery,"Very light and portable, I got it to put in my work bag and it's perfect!

5.0,I'm actually pretty blown away by this phone for the price point!,"This phone actually beats out my Moto G Stylus in MANY ways. In most ways this phone is so so much like it! The biggest con is the side fingerprint sensor which seemed cool up to the point I am using their included phone case! With the thin case on it makes it hard for my finger to make contact with the sensor, had they put the sensor on the back this phone would have been nearly perfect! The only other little complaint is the phone has no 3.5mm headphone/aux jack on it but that's a dying thing among phones anyways- you're now supposed to get the cord that goes usb-c to 3.5mm if you want to hook it into a stereo or an external speaker. The other missing feature of course is the shake to activate flashlight which I'll miss- I've tried using apps to bring it to this phone and it just didn't work out.<br /><br />It boots up really quick which is a plus. The picture quality is on par with the Moto G Stylus- it produces really nice photos! The screen is actually brighter than the Moto G and gives a slightly better picture. It has a really high definition screen, high clarity, and a big screen.<br /><br />Overall this phone is absolutely amazing for the price considering it's an unlocked phone with all these features! I've been using it for a while and only had it freeze on me once and that was because of Skype acting crazy (I've had skype freeze up many various devices, it's very buggy). Aside from that- I think this phone is nearly perfect!",1608256417985,4,False

If I had it to do over, I would have bought a better case.",1655466991339,0,True
3.0,Slightly Better than Nothing at All,"I do like this case but it needs to be thicker IMHO. Also, it should be made out of a cushier or more rubberized material, so that it offers more shock protection. There is no screen protection, so if you need that, find a supplemental accessory. Lastly, as other reviewers have stated, it is somewhat slippery and holding a grip is not great, although just slightly better than the phone by itself.

My husband spent over a month making minor adjustments to it every time we drove until it was ""perfect"". Then we got a chip in our windshield and had to have it replaced.<br /><br />If you can get it installed perfectly, with little instruction, and never have to move it to change cars or replace your windshield, then this could be a solution.

5.0,Great for Zoom Calls,Since the pandemic started I do a lot of zoom calls and having something like this that can automatically track me as I move around on the call is great. It does a great job moving as I do and it was easy to install and use the app on my phone. It works so great no matter when and what I want to use it for. Such a great thing to have.,1619303249496,0,False
4.0,Great Ear Piece,"This Bluetooth earpiece is a very innovative turn-on carrying case for the battery bank. The audio coming out of this earpiece is 5-star. This earpiece is meant to be for conversations but sometimes I play some bass-heavy Spotify music on it and it does not disappoint.<br /><br />The carrying case has managed to spark a minimalist professional look to me. It has an LED display that depicts the charge percentage and will continue to shine through the clear(but shaded) case cover when closed.<br /><br />This earpiece is not without its flaws, sadly. If you get a phone call and you answer with your phone instead of the earpiece, the earpiece will keep saying that you are receiving a phone call during the phone call(muting both YOU and the CALLER). It has disconnected several times during phone calls and while google maps were directing me to my destination and did not reconnect until turned off and on again or re-paring it on the phone. I still love the design and the thought that was put into this earpiece, very professional.",1619297159254,0,False
5.0,Great Phone Mount,I needed a new phone holder and this one works great. I just push a button and it fits my phone without problems even with my thick Otterbox case.

I also ended up changing the base to fit my other one and it changed out without problems. Couldn't be happier with this phone mount.,1618862772860,0,False
4.0,Loving It,"This battery bank is an EXCELLENT performer, it stays cold and can charge any number of devices slowly, but steadily. I was able to power my Nintendo Switch and charge the switch from 57% to 100% across an hour and continued to play for nearly 5 hours while only discharging this battery bank by 20%.<br /><br />This battery bank does not seem to actually deliver 15 watts across all ports or even the PD port... to gauge the power transfer by the battery bank I used a charge monitor app on my phone and collected the following info<br />Not Charging -623mA ... Baselined at highest discharge<br />Charging USB-A 1267mA ... 1890mA difference from Discharge<br />Charging USB-C 2068mA ... 2691mA difference from Discharge<br /><br />I was unable to achieve 3 Amps across any port and I was expecting to meet 3 Amps across all ports as advertised. 1 out of 4 came close as it was a USB-C with Power Delivery... I am still very happy with this purchase.<br /><br />I believe the volt reading can be disregarded as it had a voltage when not being charged...likely depicting the voltage of the battery itself while discharging and charging.<br /><br />I would be interested in seeing stats other people collect, maybe I got a lemon?",1617162364070,0,False
5.0,Great Phone Holder,This cell phone stand is great. It was easy to put into place and then it mounts where you want it.

The colors change with a turn of the bottom of the pen and then you can choose between blue, black, and red.<br /><br />The pen itself is elegant and easy to hold in the hand.

However, I do have to say that with these being the metal braided cords, be super careful with them because anything and everything will get caught in this cord. What I mean, is that hair will get wrapped in this like it's gotten caught in a fan blade and if that hair is still attached it will be pulled out. So be careful with these around yourself but also your pets because their hair will also get caught in these cables. So just be careful and these will be awesome.",1596395645489,0,False

I also wanted something that had large buttons so that it would be easy for her to push and use.<br /><br />This phone has ticked all the boxes I was looking for and has been a great starter phone for my mom. It has large buttons so they are easy for her to press and dial the numbers. It's nice and loud and she can hear anyone on the other end.

I also love that the legs can be bent and moved to make the tripod very sturdy to the point where you can not tip it over without really trying. I also love that this kit came with a shutter button. It was easy to find the app in the app store and it works great with my phone. It makes it a lot easier to set things up and take all the pictures I want. Everything works just as it should and I've been happy with everything.,1579639785341,3,True

4.0,"Love the Phone, Speaker Not So Much","I am simply in love with this cell phone. I originally had an older Samsung Galaxy, which I loved and still love but it needed to be replaced because the memory on it was just horrible and no matter what I did I never had enough. Not anymore, I have plenty of memory now with this Xperia and I can add up to 256 gigs more makes it amazing. I can do everything I want to do and more with this phone. I have a huge presence online so being able to post on instagram and twitter is a must for me but also Snapchat too. I can do all of that with ease with this phone as it is a breeze to use. I also love all of the personalization you can do to this phone also with live wallpapers and stuff. The phone itself works great and is crystal clear on my end and my callers end. It pairs easily to my wifi and is just great all around. I didn't think I would love another type of cell phone like I have the Galaxies but Sony has made me a believer in another brand of cell phone.<br /><br />**Update**<br /><br />Okay, now that I have had this phone for a while and really used everything I can honestly say that this is a great phone and I adore it. Everything on this phone works great, it's super quick and just awesome.<br /><br />Now, there is one thing about this phone that I would change. That would be the speaker! The speaker on this phone, sucks! I mean that too. Unless I am in a quiet room with nothing else going on, I can't hardly hear anything when I have the speaker phone on. It really is that bad. I use it all the time and every time I use it I have to make sure I am some where closed off from everything, nothing on so I am able to hear the person on the other end.<br /><br />Besides the speaker being junk, the phone is brilliant in every other way possible. It has more room than any phone I have ever had. I am able to fill it with apps, pictures, music, whatever I want and it runs as fast as ever with no lag or problems. Phone calls are great and clear, so long as you don't use the speaker phone, and the phone itself is sharp and handsome.<br /><br />If you can get past the speaker phone being pure junk, then you are going to love this phone.<br /><br />***If you don't like my review, please tell me why so I can make them better and more informed. Thanks.",1491957758000,3,False
5.0,Totally Great Cover,"Great case that totally protects my phone. I was so glad I popped this on when I did. I went to a football game the other night and totally threw my phone down the cement steps but it didn't have one scratch on it thanks to this case. It kept the screen from scrapping across the ground and it stopped it from cracking it as it flew down the steps, pretty much hitting everything on the way to the bottom.

I can pass my phone to a person in the back and let them change the music without any problems and still have a nice amount of cord left. It is amazing how well this cord works and just makes things so much easier now. I love this extender and I didn't even know you could get them.

5.0,I'm Loving It!,"Finally, a selfie stick that actually is easy to use and works perfectly with my Galaxy S3. I've went through a few selfie sticks and they have all been hard to use with my phone, for some reason. When I received this one I was expecting the same but after a quick read through the instructions and a quick download of an app that works with the selfie stick I was taking pictures within five minutes.<br /><br />This selfie stick is super easy to use. Just simply place your phone into the mount, plug the cord into the headphone jack, with my phone I would then go into the selfie stick app, extend the stick and begin snapping away. It's literally that easy and so much easier to use than all of the other selfie sticks I have attempted to use.<br /><br />As far as what the selfie stick looks like, I'm not going to lie that I love that it is girly and pink. Might not be everyone's cup of tea but I like it so whatever.<br /><br />Once finished just push the stick back to the normal size, fold the mount head down, which fits perfectly around the stick itself and place into the holding bag that comes with the selfie stick. I then throw it in my purse because it goes every where with me now. I really love it and love using it, especially when I want to get all my friends in the picture. Love it!",1457898831000,0,False

It has a very nice taste with orange, ginger, and other things that make it fruity and spicy which is great on a cold morning. I've also done this in an iced tea and it is good that way too. As for giving you an energy boost I would say that it totally does. It warms me up and puts a spark back into my step. I really like it. I can see drinking this more often and it would help much more. But as for just a tea, it's really good and any tea lover will really like it.",1452396269000,0,False
5.0,Looks great and Protects,"This is a great case for my new Galaxy S6 Edge as it fits in nice and snug, no worries about it falling out. Also, it's great that it has places on the inside to put your credit cards, extra cash, or license so you don't have to carry around a wallet or purse along with the case if you don't want to. It also seems to protect it pretty well also as it doesn't stick out of the case and if it were to fall the case would cushion the fall. The only thing with this case is that it does stand up and that's great but the tab that keeps the case shut gets in the way and doesn't want to flip back or anything so it does make it a bit of a pain to hold it back when you want to watch something. Other than that though it's a great case and I love the variety of colors you can get so you can match it to everything.",1431654474000,0,False

However, it has survived perfectly and honestly I would totally buy another one and am thinking about it to have a choice between colors. This case fits perfectly on the 3DS and there is no chance of it slipping off or anything like that. The underside is covered in a velvet like stuff to protect  the 3DS itself from the cover. It's easy to hold and doesn't feel bulky in your hands. It's really a perfect case and very well made. I really do love it.",1399491143000,1,True

I am very motivated to use bamboo products as often as possible as it's an economical and environmentally friendly material. This is a small box on the underneath that holds the top tray. The charging station can hold 3 devices or more. The front of the tray has two slots as well as the section behind it. This allows cords that are fed into the sides to peek out to charge smaller devices like phones. I find this is great for multi-device households. The kids don't take their devices with them once it's bedtime for good sleep hygiene. Instead, they are always fully charged in the morning. I use this as well while sleeping on weekends or when the entire household is at home. It helps any tabletop or desktop surface stay neat and tidy looking as it holds all of the charging cables. I do suggest using tape inside the box section to secure cords. I hope my experience is helpful to you and you kindly click the button below.",1628927479442,12,False
5.0,Works Well,"I'm happy with my order of the PSOOO Solar Power Bank 50000mAh Phone Charger. It does a good job and keeps a good charge. It didn't take as long to re-charge as some of my other power banks. I like the option to use the solar charge, even though I've not had a need for it yet. The light is nice and bright, and certainly handy for emergency situations. I also like that I can use different cords, which is great for me as different devices have different cords. I find this power bank to be a fair value and appreciate the added features. I hope my review is helpful to you and you kindly will click the button below.",1624846067871,0,False
5.0,Solid Phone Charger,"I'm happy with the 2 Pack 18W Type C PD 3.0 Fast Chargers. They are excellent to charge cell phones and tablets at our house that use this style of plug. They certainly seemed to charge a bit more quickly than the adapter we were using previously. It's a good value for a twin pack. I especially like the shape, as it doesn't block other outlets on a strip.",1617950202599,0,False
5.0,Very Happy!,"I'm very happy with the myCharge Portable Charger Power Bank because it charges all my devices very quickly. The housing on the power bank in thick and strong. I would trust this bank for transport in a purse, backpack or bag because it's solid and durable. I take this to work with me, as I work at a hospital and I'm sometimes too tired between shifts to fully charge my cell phone, which I also use at work. I carry this in my pocket of my scrubs, and despite all my moving about, it hasn't had a scratch. This is a great power bank for busy people!

5.0,Hold my iPad Well,SUPERONE All Metal Tablet Mount has not disappointed at all in terms of function or ease-of-use. I can easily use my iPad away from surfaces while I'm following tutorials at the workbench or take it to my nightstand to watch movies comfortably. The goose-neck allows for different positions and holds my tablet securely. I'm very pleased with this order and highly recommend it for the great value and versatile use that allows your tablet to be more accessible for use.,1602311016023,0,False
5.0,Flexible and Sturdy,"I was skeptical of the stability of the Soonpho Tripod Stand, but no matter how I positioned my phone into the holder and flexed the goose-neck, it was very stable on the floor. This is great if you want to have your phone off of your work surface, make videos or to make photos and keep a stable view. I have no regrets in ordering the Soonpho Tripod Stand. I found it easy to set-up and fold-down for storage. It requires very little space to store. It also comes with it's own nylon bag to keep it easy to grab-and-go and keep organized. I have no regrets for ordering the Soonpho Tripod Stand and recommend it for anyone that needs some flexibility for their tripod phone mount.",1602304075998,0,False
4.0,"Charge Outdoors, No Outlets Needed","The ECEEN Solar Charger 20W Portable Solar Panel Charger allows for charging from sunlight. It does better with full sun, but it will charge with less, only slower. That's just how solar panels work. I've charged a few things at different times. It depends on how much power your device can store, the amount of sunlight, angle of the panels and sometimes just luck. This is good for me to take along anytime I'm out in nature. I've never been lost, but there is always the first time and I feel a lot better having a way to charge my phone. It doesn't weight much. The panels are thin, fold up, but it's delicate. I put it in the top of my pack. It says it's waterproof, but I don't care to find out the hard way so I put it in plastic anyhow. The panel's backing is nylon canvas, so it's decently sturdy.<br /><br />I find the ECEEN Solar Charger 20W Portable Solar Panel Charger to be a fair to good value. The peace of mind I have is worth it to me.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review. Click Helpful below if my review was in any way helpful to you. Have a blessed day.",1600660427011,1,False
5.0,Versatile Use Solar Power Bank,"This works great on sunny days. I've had a difficult time finding full sunlight available to me lately during my regular waking hours, so I don't feel the charge speeds I get from the power bank most recently are a fair assessment. However, this can also charge in the same manner as any other power bank. Use the appropriate cable for your device(s) and you are all set. If you are using the solar panel feature with the power bank, I strongly suggest to use the charging panels to shield your device underneath from the sunlight to avoid over heating your batteries.<br /><br />Not only is the solar charger a solar power bank that can use an wall-outlet adapter, but it also has a flashlight with a couple different modes, a compass and it folds small. It has some weight to it, but the panels are fragile. Store this at the top of your pack, in plastic if you are going to be outdoors. Indoors, do not store in plastic to avoid the risk of mold growth. I may depend on this in emergencies, so it's important to maintain it in good working order throughout the lifetime of the lithium batteries within. This is handy for the times you may be venturing out into the wilds or traveling somewhere unfamiliar to you.<br /><br />This is great for outdoor adventures to have on hand in case of emergencies or at home in case of power outages. I feel the value is fair, for the versatile uses, but would not be ideal if used primarily as an indoor-only power bank. It would make a wonderful, thoughtful gift for the outdoorsy person in your life.<br /><br />Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope you found it helpful and will click he Helpful button below.",1599180331739,0,False
5.0,Works Well So Far,"The BLAVOR Solar Charger with Foldable Panels has not disappointed in function. It has a nice flexible tab over the ports, so this would certainly be good to have in outdoor situations or when slight humidity may be a concern. The flashlight is bright enough for me to see well in a dark interior room. I've tried wall charging, and that is as I would expect for the capacity of the battery. I found it easy to use. I've not had enough sunlight available to me while I am awake during the daytime to get a full-charge, but it does get some. It really depends on what is available.<br /><br />I ordered this to have for emergencies when weather causes the power to go out. I can charge my phone and other daily use devices several times over when the battery is fully charged. The only thing that I do not care for is the fabric material. I do not believe it will age as well as the electronic components. I would have selected a thicker fabric with a tighter weave. This is may seem a minor concern, but I see this as an oversight in the overall engineering.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review. I hope you found it helpful and will click the helpful button below.",1598826840146,1,False
5.0,Versatile Kit With Many Configurations Possible,"The Ring Light with Stand and Phone Holder was a really nice surprise. This is actually a 2 pack of gooseneck desk clamps that come with 2 swivel ball-jointed adapters, a small 6"" ring light and a spring-loaded phone holder. The phone holder can accommodate a phone from 6.5cm (2 3/4"") up to 10cm (4""). The gooseneck alone has a length of 58.5cm (23cm) from the surface of the desktop mount. The clamp opens to a maximum depth of 6cm (2 1/4"").  This should fit most desktops. The ring light has 11 different brightness settings with 3 different color temperatures. I like that the control is on the cord because it helps prevent accidentally resetting while manipulating the position of the light. Each part has the standard 1/4"" threading, so this can work with many different compatible components available from various sources. This is great because a reflector mount or clip can be used, different phone mounts, light weight cameras or different sizes of ring light besides what is included in the kit.<br /><br />The allows for filming, photos and lighting from overhead of the table/desk top, instead of only from the side as you would have with tripods. It preserves your table top space. I really like this to take photos of some desktop projects I'm working on from an overhead perspective. It also is great for those with limited floor space or anyone that wishes to avoid having their fragile equipment on the floor (especially great for anyone with rowdy animals or crawling babies and toddlers). I can have the ring light setup on my desk and no fears of my dogs running into it or knocking something over.<br /><br />On thing worth noting is that there is padding on the top side of the desk clamp. On the threaded underside, there is not padding. I've simply used a felt furniture pad on this to protect the underside of surfaces. I have a stash of these in my junk drawer. They're not at all expensive. You can find them in nearly any shop that sells basic home goods. It would have been nice if this was included.<br /><br />I've compared the price point to similar offerings and concluded this is among the best values. This is especially true considering that these are 2 separate goosenecks with an adjustable, secure mount. I would highly recommend the Ring Light with Stand and Phone Holder for it's versatility and value.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.

5.0,"Portable, Light-Weight and Easy to Use","I was surprised this came in it's own case. That was nice and very much appreciated. I like how small and light weight it is. I use lots of power banks. My phone usually holds a good charge, but it's good to have on hand. I'm using the Hot Pink Glitter Portable Charger 60000mah Power Bank right now to power a small globe lamp on my table to avoid a cord going under anyone's feet. It makes for a cute centerpiece for dinner. This will easily fit in a purse, diaper bag or many pockets. It's so simple to use, a child could manage it as well.<br /><br />So far, this does exactly what I would expect any 6000 mAh power bank to do. You can use either a micro-USB or a USB A cord, one is even included with the case and instructions. You get a lot of bang for your buck with this. Also, it's cute, which is nice. It will stand out so you will not mistake your power bank from another if you live in a busy household.<br /><br />Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope you found it helpful and will click the Helpful button below.",1598496947330,0,False
5.0,"A Nice, Strong Charging Cord","This is a nicer charging cord. I have a micro USB cord that's held up quite well and this one is just as nicely made. It's not the longest cord, but works well for bedside charging. It also looks really nice. My son goes through cords like... well, a teenage boy. I'm hoping this one will last a little longer for him.<br /><br />It's hard to buy charging cords without seeing and touching them in person, but I will not lead you astray, fellow Amazon shopper. I would be very happy to buy this from a local shop, so let the package come to you and save yourself some trouble of going out. Christmas is closer than it was yesterday, this would make a good stocking stuffer.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review. I hope you have found it helpful.",1598236720825,3,False
2.0,"Not the Best Engineering, Not for Heavy Cameras","Endurax Cell Phone Tripod 60"" isn't sturdy enough for heavier cameras. A simple point-and-shoot or cell phone would probably work fine. It's stated on the box it will hold up to 6.6lbs, but I wouldn't recommend any more than 3lbs. The tension thumb screws lock into place with little nuts that will drop out of the head mount if you loosen too far, which is easy to do. If this happens in the grass, they would be easily lost. One of the tension thumb screws and nuts isn't pre-positioned, it's in a baggie and the instructions state how to place it. The other 2 tension thumb screws are already positioned, so I'm unsure why this is sent to customers without being fully assembled. The cell phone holder does extend to hold some of the wider phones, so that is nice. There is a remote included. I don't use those, so I cannot comment on that. The tension for the spread of the tripod legs isn't terribly secure, and without some counter weights, it could easily topple over. Usually, camera tripods have a hook to hold some counter weights, but this one does not. The legs are not terribly sturdy, so I certainly would not try a very heavy camera on this tripod.<br /><br />However, if you are looking for a budget tripod for a light-weight camera, ring light or something else light-weight, this will do the job. It's not the worst tripod I have tested and reviewed, but it's far, far from the best. I wouldn't recommend this one because the nuts can fall out and be lost so easily, making it useless. If the nuts were securely placed, and there was a hook for counter weights, this would be a better value. If I do use this beyond testing, I'm adding some tape to cover the slots for the thumb screw nuts. I'm also not going to use this anywhere it may be accidentally bumped, or in wind because it's just going to topple over so easily. This would be better for very occasional indoor use.<br /><br />The two nice points I can find is that a carrying/storage bag is included and the legs extend easily are are easy to adjust.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review. I hope you found it helpful.",1598223316255,8,False
4.0,"A Sturdy Mount, Keeps Your Phone Steady","This is a more solid bike mount than some others we have tried. If you need something a little more sturdy, this will do the job. It takes a little more effort than some other types to remove your phone, but it's also held securely quite well. If you do short trips and need to grab and go, then this may slow you down a little bit. Each movement will require the thumb screws to be manipulated. It's not unreasonable to believe that with time, the threads will become worn and stripped. With regular use, this should last a couple years. However, it's solid metal and can withstand some conditions that simple silicone and plastic mounts will not tolerate as well.<br /><br />My son has been using it, and he likes it. There are two options listed, so make sure you order the one that meets your needs best. I do believe some others may have picked the option that had less parts and found the product to be disappointing, so that's something to keep in mind.<br /><br />You don't need anything other than a place to mount the Bicycle & Motorcycle Universal Phone Mount. It could also mount on nearly any other tube, like exercise equipment or a wire shelf.<br /><br />Thank you so much for reading my review. I hope you found it helpful.",1598047811157,0,False
5.0,Great for Higher Capacity Power Banks,"I've been using the 65W USB C Wall Charger to charge a few different power banks. It does what I need it to do, and doesn't take as much time as some of my other wall chargers. I appreciate the space-saving ability. This would be great for students or others that have smaller living quarters. The included cable appears to be built solid, and it's thicker than most charging cables. I like that it can also accommodate USB-A cords, as most of mine use that type of charging cable.<br /><br />I cannot speak to durability as it's new. I will be sure to post an update if/when I ever encounter issues.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review. I hope you found it helpful.",1598005272379,0,False
5.0,Durable and Versatile Power Banks,"I liked that this came as a twin pack. My son has given these some time to charge while riding his bike around the neighborhood between trips to visit grandma, the little corner shop and just to exercise. I would advise to use zip-ties if you would like to hang these on a bicycle or backpack. That has worked well for us. Each bank holds a decent amount of charge. My son has had a few re-charges for his phone and wireless earbuds along with more power for some USB ring lights we used outdoors a few times.<br /><br />There's a bumper all the way around the bank, so these are great for outdoors. It's always good to bring more power with you than you might think you need, just the same as water. The flashlight is a thoughtful touch.<br /><br />This would be a great gift for anyone active outdoors and teens.<br /><br />Thanks so much for reading my review. I hope you found it helpful.",1598004245137,0,False
5.0,Versatile Ports are Great!,"This is my favorite power bank. The more power a bank can store, the higher the weight. This is a good shape for the amount of power it can hold, which is 20,000 miliamp hours. My favorite feature is that there are multiple ports for charging the ROMOSS Sense 6S Portable Charger. It charges just as I would expect either with the USB-A or USB-C type cable. I've not tested the lightening port yet.<br /><br />I've used this outdoors to power ring lights during night-time dinners, re-charged my phone, re-charged my wireless earbuds and gave my vape mods charges while I was away from home. It does exactly what I would expect. I carry it in my purse. I don't carry much, so overall it's not too heavy. It reminds me of having a 24oz bottle of soda in my purse. It would be too big for my pocket, but I like to re-charge a few items before giving the power bank some time at the outlet.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review. I hope you found it helpful.",1598003845626,0,False
5.0,Meets My Expectations,"This proves handy. You get a decent amount of charge from a full bank. It's handy to have for using USB devices outdoors. I can have some ring lights attached near the patio table and no worries about anyone tripping over power cords. If our camping trip had not been cancelled, I would have brought this with me. The lights are good indicators of when you have a full charge, it goes solid. I use the supplied cord and it's decently thick and durable so far. I've used this for several occasions and would recommend it. MyCharge is a favorite brand among many of my co-workers that sometimes pull shifts lasting over 24 hours. This keeps phones charged and Bluetooth speakers playing tunes well into the night.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review. I hope you find it helpful.",1598003389170,1,False
5.0,So Convienient and Easy to Use,"This is a very nice basic tripod. I had it out of the box and doing work within only a few moments. I simply unlatched the locking slides and let it expand, then expanded the feet. I like how small it folds, my older tripod does not fold up very small. This is better to use for ring lights or cell phones. It's only heavy duty in comparison to table top tripods, not the traditional style tripods for heavier cameras. This is great for me to use with a ring light and a power bank out on the patio for outdoor dinners and BBQs with family. It's so easy to use for what I need, I happily award the Ruittos 54” Selfie Stick Tripod stand 5 stars.",1597553078036,0,False
5.0,Helps Tame the Multi-Charge Cord Mess,"This features all the regular safety features of any similar extension cord but also provides a 10-port hub to charge all your devices. I don't know about anyone else, but my charging cords were becoming a mess. I had more things I wanted to charge at once and not enough space. I don't always like to use my PC either, as it just makes for more clutter and it's annoying. The ISWOJOR Multiple USB Charging Station can go into any outlet in your home and make one place for charging. It might sound like a small thing, but all the different cord nests around the PC, the kitchen counter and my night stand have been moved and I have a lot more space for living than charging all this stuff all over the house.<br /><br />Thanks for reading my review.

Also, the alchohol wipe that comes with it was completely dried out. Because of the dust stuck in there I'm going to have to scrap this one and buy a different one.

5.0,A slim iPhone 14 case with a silky feel and a built in ring/holder,"[[VIDEOID:66092c961c39bff86f0c9349a84e5066]] When it comes to phone protection, I strike a balance between bulkiness and protection.  I opt for a slim case to keep the phone small, then I add a tempered glass screen protector for the front and it generally protects my phone well enough.  Including protection from falls and scratches.<br /><br />Thomo Compatible with iPhone 14 Case is just the kind of case that I like.  It is slim at perhaps 1/8 inch thickness all around, made from silicone and lined with a soft felt so there's no danger of scratching the phone while taking it on/off.<br /><br />The silicone case itself has a silky texture that gives it a high-end feel and the color isn't well-represented in my pictures is a nice, dark maroon.<br /><br />Add to this, the built-in ring that I usually have to add to my phones to give me better grip so that there's even less chance for me to drop it.  Of course, the ring also serves as a kickstand for video watching.<br /><br />Now while most cases just come in a box, Thomo tried to set themselves apart by including a nice letter with little blurbs written by various people in their company.  It's a nice touch that gives the impression that they care.  The included sticker is nice too.",1672937107673,1,False
4.0,Lovely band that has so many conveniences.,"I really do love this watch band.  I pair it with my Galaxy Watch 4, although the listing says that it is for Galaxy Watch 5.  That's not to say there aren't issues with it, though...<br /><br />So instead of going for the sure thing that is the black silicone band, I went for the blue.  I think it really makes the watch stand out on my wrist.  The silicone is soft with a satin finish that is comfortable against my skin.<br /><br />This band has many nice features.  The soft silicone, as I said, is comfortable and flexible.  The clasp mechanism is a quick release that lets you take of the watch very easily.  To adjust the length of the band, there is a little lock on the clasp that allows you to adjust the band, then close the lock and the band stays in place.  This means that the band is infinitely adjustable so that you can get the perfect fit.  The clasp mechanism is magnetic, which is fine for the most part.  Magnets make is easy to clasp and unclasp the watch.<br /><br />So here's the big problem with this band:  The magnetic clasp.  While it is very convenient, it does come off.  I haven't had any issues with it coming apart during day-to-day use, but when I'm active (playing tennis), I do find that it comes apart.  Being silicone, this really should be considered a sports band and if the thing comes apart while playing sports, it kinda defeats the purpose.  I'll probably need to have a little velcro band or rubber band to keep the clasp closed when I play sports.",1668811129445,0,False
5.0,Neat little fast charger,"[[VIDEOID:1610c6ad3b0203a9eeccb968991a85b4]] With Apple leading the way to not including a charger with their phones, it's become necessary to invest in a good charger as part of your phone purchase.  I have personal gripes about their claims of it being more environmentally friendly, but I'll leave that out of this review.<br /><br />With that said, let's talk about this Type-C fast charger.  It supports 35W PD over Type-C.  On a Pixel 7 phone, it will support the maximum charging speed at 20W of power with power to spare.<br /><br />While it's compact, it unfortunately still takes up an extra plug space on my power strip.  The folding prongs makes this charger great for travel as it is super compact and just looks neat.  This is power and style in one package.<br /><br />This is a secondary charger that I keep in my bedroom and it works perfectly for what I need.",1668280828603,11,False
3.0,Pretty bulky power bank.  Well built,"This laptop power bank is powerful and built like a tank.  It as an aluminum casing and the whole product is quite substantial.  In this review, I'll be approaching this device through my previous experience with a similar [[ASIN:B09S9LP3D4 Portable Laptop charger (let's call it The Competitor for clarity)]].<br /><br />Both products boast an AC output and type-C PD.  They have similar ratings when it comes to their battery capacity.  This power bank does output 150W through its AC output while The Competitor outputs only 120W, which is why I decided to pick up this one power bank.  One additional feature that attracted me to this power bank is also its DC barrel connector output.<br /><br />In terms of the AC output, my laptop takes a 130w power supply through Type-C.  Both of these power banks only output 100w PD so my laptop, will charge but will complain about the lower power input, and thus throttle my CPU/GPU.  The AC output will give this power bank the advantage here.  At 150W, I can plug the laptop's charger into this power bank and my laptop will perform at full power.<br /><br />As for the DC barrel connector output, my hope was to be able to power my projector, but it takes a 19v input.  It's unfortunate that the output of this power bank is only at 12v.  Unfortunately, this makes the DC output on this power bank useless for me.<br /><br />One last departing thought:  The Competitor comes with a carrying case and can charge through USB type-C and this power bank comes with a DC power adapter with a barrel connector as well as a car charger, also with a barrel connector.<br /><br />Just as a test, I did plug in Type-C from my wall charger to this device and it does seem to start charging so I believe Type-C charging is possible on this power bank.<br /><br />Overall, I think that both are good products, but there IS a big price difference that you really need to have a good use case to justify.",1668047497216,0,False
4.0,A more portable solution for my Dell XPS 17 9710,"My Dell XPS 17 9710 is a gaming laptop with a discreet Nvidia RTX 3050 which means that it can be a power hog.  Designed to be charged through its USB Type-C/Thunderbolt ports, this laptop requires a 130w power source, otherwise, Windows will warn about a low-power device and will throttle the GPU and GPU.<br /><br />This 140W USB C Charger for MacBook Pro 16 inch 2021 outputs the necessary wattage.  It is very stylish and quite compact in size.  Compared to the standard charger, this charger is much more compact and easier to pack into luggage when the prongs are folded in.<br /><br />However, no charging cables come with this charger, which means you need to invest in a good cable.  When it comes to USB Type-C, every component of the charging system needs to be rated for the wattage you need because the voltage and amperage is negotiated by the charger, the cable, and the device itself.  If any one of those can't go up to 130w, you'll be slow charging.<br /><br />In terms of price, you're paying a premium for the Mac design aesthetics and add to that, the price of a good cable can be up to $20.  In the end, you're around $100.  Compare this to a standard 130w type-c laptop charger and you'd be paying almost double the price.<br /><br />In the end, it'll be up to you to decide whether the portability of this product is worth that extra upcharge.",1666930568674,1,False
5.0,Not just for Apple devices!,"While this 4-in-1 wireless charger is marketed for Apple devices (the iPhone, Airpods, and Apple Watch), wireless charging works across other brands as well.<br /><br />First, this charger is stylish in white and sports a nice RGB light that you can toggle among 8 different colors.  It can serve as a nice night light if that's something you need.  It has 4 induction coils (two for the phone to support portrait or landscape modes) but does not support mag-safe.  The phone charger portion supports three positions and can be used as a phone stand for watching videos while charging.<br /><br />For myself, I don't use Apple devices but it doesn't mean that I can't take advantage of some of the nice accessories that are made for them.  This charger is able to charge my Cleer wireless earbuds and my Pixel 3, but unfortunately, I'm unable to charge my Samsung Galaxy Watch 4.<br /><br />The problem with the Samsung watch is because Samsung decided to go with some sort of custom wireless charging standard rather than the standard that everyone else is using.<br /><br />Overall, I like this thing.  It is stylish and allows me to easily to keep my devices charged for my daily use.",1664845030673,0,False
4.0,Great little charger that works for Android as well,"I love this little charger!  The NEWDERY Magnetic Wireless Portable Charger is compact, fast-charging, and supports magsafe.  There is a single type-c port to charge the power pack with or you can use the port to charge your device if it doesn't support wireless charging.<br /><br />Just snap this charger to your phone and it will stay put without the need to mess with a charging wire.  It came in really handy just the other day when my phone ran low on charge but I needed to leave the house.  I just attached the charger and put it in my pocket.  It kept the phone working for the rest of the afternoon.<br /><br />I don't use an iphone so I purchased a magnetic sticker to stick to make my phone magnetic which then allows me to use this charger.  The sticker is about 1/8"" thick and doesn't work well through a plastic case, but I plan to cut out the back of the case in order for the sticker to fit through the case.<br /><br />At 10000mah, it serves well as a personal charger, but if you need something to charge multiple devices, you'll need to buy something bigger with more ports.<br /><br />The reason I gave this a 4* is that there are very similar devices out there that also have a fold-out stand to turn this into a phone stand.",1664842842891,0,False
1.0,The change to the phone is permanent.,"I was going to do a full review with pictures and even sample video but the FeiyuTech Vimble 3 really disappointed me.<br /><br />Firstly, I tried to pair this gimbal on three of my Android phones and none of them were able to pair.  In fact, it had a very odd problem.  On the first phone, I installed the Feiyu On app and attempted to pair the gimbal.  No devices were found.  In the phones bluetooth settings, I searched for bluetooth devices and saw a bunch of things around me but none of them were the gimbal.<br /><br />For sanity check, I checked the other two phones and they were able to see the gimbal in their bluetooth list, ready to pair.  I decided to give up on the first phone and moved on to the second phone.<br /><br />On my second phone, I installed the Feiyu On app and tried to pair.  Unable to find a device and after that, the device no longer showed up on the phones bluetooth list.  The app did something to the phone where it no longer sees the gimbal.<br /><br />Reluctantly, I decided to try on my daily driver.  The phone that I have in my pocket every day.  This time, I paired the gimbal through bluetooth first, then installed and launched the app.  The app found the gimbal but warned me not to pair it with the phone through the system's settings.  It let me connect anyway.  I took the opportunity to update the firmware on the gimbal but I really don't want to use my daily driver as the phone I want to use with this gimbal.<br /><br />So back to my other two phones.  Try as I might (reinitializing the gimbal and unpairing the bluetooth according to Feiyutech's FAQ page), the other two phones still wouldn't see the gimbal.  I even factory reset one of them.  The change to the phone is permanent!<br /><br />On my main phone, I decided to give up on the whole thing and unpair the gimbal and delete the app.  Guess what?  After unpairing, my main phone no longer sees the gimbal anymore.<br /><br />Something really fishy is going on.",1655609842991,1,False
3.0,palm rejection and that's about all.,"This basic stylus for the ipad is only slightly better than a pen with a capacitive tip, really.  There is no pressure sensitivity, no tilt sensitivity, and no soft tip for a paper feel.  The advantage that it has over a standard capacitive pen is that it is more accure, but then you don't need to charge a capacitive pen.<br /><br />This stylus comes with three tips but that's really just for show.  You will never wear the tip out because it is hard plastic and doesn't have any sort of paper-like feel.  It takes a little getting used to because I prefer more friction when I'm writing and so my handwriting isn't quite the same as when I write on pen-and-paper.<br /><br />If you don't want to spend $100 on an original Apple and you don't need any of the fancy tilt and pressure sensors, this will work just fine for you.  Add a paper-like screen protector and you'll probably have an easier time with this than I did.",1638031171309,0,False
5.0,Works well with Oculus Quest 2,"When it comes to USB type-c cables, it is a jungle out there.  I'm not going through the litany of cable types out there suffice it to say that when it comes to cables required by Oculus, you need one capable of high-speed data.  What you'll find is that most type-c cables that fit this bill are quite short and have a premium cost.  You the add the fact that you will need a very long cable in order to be tethered to your PC, the price can get outrageous.<br /><br />Thankfully, the popularity of the Oculus Quest headsets, there is a market for cables that meet these two requirements and along with that market comes competition for price.  So now that the early adopters who purchased the Quest/Quest 2 at the get go helped create this market, we can take advantage of the new, lower prices of these cables.<br /><br />The FBesteam Quest Link Cable 16FT/5M is a thick braided cable that is fairly stiff (which is a minus when it comes to tethering and moving around), but performs well with Oculus Link.<br /><br />On my laptop, the Type-C port may have outdated drivers or firmware so I'm unable to use the Type-C to Type-C cable by itself.  I was forced to use a Type-A to Type-C adapter.  The quality of the image is better than the wireless options and the data rate is fast enough for what I need.<br /><br />Overall, a good cable.",1626710401426,2,False

This particular one, the Battery Handle Grip, is advertised for GoPro but I think it is ideal for the DJI Pocket and vloggers in general.<br /><br />I had a chance to take this battery handle on a trip over the weekend and I must say, it performed beautifully.  This battery handle has a 10000mah battery built in.  Enough to keep my DJI Pocket charged during an entire day out and recording throughout the day.  I even had the DJI Pocket connected to my phone for most of the second day.  I can't describe how big of a difference it makes not having to worry about how much battery life is left in the camera.<br /><br />The mini tripod helps to extend the length of the handle, meaning when doing selfies, the camera can be placed far enough to frame my face along with other subjects that I want to keep in the background.  Open that tripod up and set it down anywhere to include myself in the shot.  I also set the tripod down to take panorama shots that is programmed into the DJI Pocket.<br /><br />Such a great experience!",1617826346823,1,True
4.0,This charger comes with two coils and has a mount for a third.,"As declared in its listing title, this charger was made for Apple devices.  When used with Apple devices, there is one charging coil for the phone, another for the Airpods and there is a mounting hole to mount the charger for the Apple watch that can supposedly plug into the USB port on the side of the device.  As a bonus, it comes with a selfie light.<br /><br />This wireless charger comes with a wall adapter that can output 5V 3A, 9V 2A, or 12V 1.5A and is rated for Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0.  This means that by itself, the wall adapter can charge some hefty devices from tablets to phones but it is not as strong as the newer Type-C PD chargers.<br /><br />I'm not an Apple user so my experience is with an LG V40 and a pair of wireless earbuds that supports wireless charging.  What I found is that the 15W wireless charging can charge the phone very well, even though my phone's coils don't line up perfectly with the charger (again, the stand is designed for Apple phones).  It can also charge the earbuds to full with no issues.  It just can't do both at once.  Whether it's because the two coils are stealing amperage from each other or because the wall adapter isn't strong enough, I'm uncertain.<br /><br />With this experience, I believe that this charger probably can't charge three Apple devices together if the watch charger is plugged into the stand's USB port.<br /><br />Overall, I still like this charger because my earbuds generally don't need to be charged daily and the stand makes my phone easily accessible.",1616909323270,0,False
5.0,"In an emergency, the battery pack that works is the one that gets 5 stars","Thankfully, I haven't gotten myself into an emergency where the solar capabilities on this power bank was necessary to save my life but would anyone wish to be in such a situation?<br /><br />When putting together an emergency kit, food, blanket, hand cranked radio, flashlight, and drink are a must, but now more than ever, battery power may be necessary.  What better than a solar-rechargeable power bank to fit this bill?<br /><br />This power bank is not compact, in fact it is quite bulky compared to all other power banks I've purchased in the last two year.  It is not feature rich, there is no quick charge 3.0, the USB type-c seems to be for charging the power bank and not for charging a phone.  It is also not pretty, it looks like a Black and Decker power tool.  Those things aren't what you're buying this for though, right?<br /><br />After a couple of weeks of use, I found that you can gain one bar (there are 4 led's, one led representing one bar) with one day's exposure to the California sun, and one bar can theoretically charge my LG G6 about 20%.  Not too bad, I think.  In addition, there is a built-in flash light that, being LED, should last quite a while with such a big power pack backing it up.<br /><br />Basically, this device works.  It is advertised as solar-charging and that feature works -- slowly, as expected from such a small panel.  It is advertised as a 25000mah battery pack and that works as well.  I'd say this device is just what I thought I was going to get.  Very satisfied with my purchase.",1572443676834,35,True
5.0,No bubbles!,"Having purchased many, many tempered glass screen protectors, I pretty much know what to expect in the package.<br /><br />This product comes with three sets of the following:<br />- wet towelette,<br />- dry towelette (dust free paper),<br />- sticker sheet (two rectangular to help keep the glass lined up while you take off the protective film, and one dust collector to take off any dust that may have floated onto your nice, clean screen)<br />- tempered glass.<br /><br />The fit of the glass on the phone is very good, although if you're a perfectionist, you may find that the cutout for the front-facing camera is perhaps 1/16 inch off.  It doesn't block the camera in any way.  The glass fits on the screen with no air pockets on the corners and the feel of the glass itself is smooth, like the original gorilla glass.<br /><br />I've had phones (LG G5, Galaxy Note 4) where the glass just wouldn't sit completely flat and there would be one corner that will always have an air pocket.  I've also had glass that felt...  wrong.  Something on the glass made it hard for the finger to slide on it.

1.0,T-Mobile-specific review.  Signal boosting...  if you're standing within 10 feet of it.,"This review will be specific to T-Mobile customers.<br /><br />The big question for anyone interested in this product is whether it does what it says.  The quick answer is No.  But we need to  break down exactly what is claimed:<br /><br />My test conditions:<br /> - T-Mobile provider<br /> - MyTouch 4g and BLU Studio 5 II<br /> - Suburbs of Cleveland, Ohio<br /><br />As a comparison, I have a cel-fi provided by T-Mobile for free but needed another signal booster for my parents who are also under my phone plan.<br /><br />Setup:<br /> The setup for the zBoost is fairly simple.  An external antenna is connected by a coax cable to the booster itself and the booster is plugged in to the wall socket for power.  The next challenge is to find the right position for the external antenna.<br /><br />Tip:<br />As other reviews have noted, the separation between external antenna and the booster unit is important, but the manual suggests that it’s the VERTICAL distance that’s important.  It suggests a 10ft VERTICAL separation between the external antenna and the booster unit.<br /><br />Claims:<br /> - Dual Band (800/1900):  Searching Google shows that T-Mobile deployed the 1900 frequency between 2012 - 2013.  This means that phones older than 2012 will not work with this signal booster for 3G.  The MyTouch 4g did NOT work with this signal booster at all.  Not even for Edge.  The BLU Studio worked.<br /> - Up To 2,500 sq ft. coverage:  The zBoost fails here.  It’s a separate issue from whether you’ve found the optimal position for the external antenna.  Holding the BLU Studio, I get 5 bars at 5 feet from the booster unit, but walk away to 25 feet and the signal falls to about 2 bars.  Walk to the next room and the signal disconnects and calls are no longer possible.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />First thing to note about this unit is how old your phone is.  T-Mobile started providing the 1900 frequency to attract iPhone customers away from ATT and coverage for that frequency is spottier than their already poor coverage (popular opinion, not mine).<br />Compared to the T-Mobile Cel-Fi, the T-Mo unit stays connected at 40 feet at 2 bars.  So while both units have very short broadcast distances, the zBoost is inexcusable.  Exclusive of whether it is possible to find an optimal location for the external antenna at your location, the lack of coverage from the booster unit negates the usefulness of this device -- especially for the price they charge for it.  I’d like to say that you should give the T-Mo units a try but the ones on Amazon are sold by individuals so you may not be able to return them if they don’t work out.",1409764928000,1,True
5.0,Bursting the Mobile Carriers' bubble.,"Take away the bull$h** of contracts, SIM locking to carriers, and fancy &#34;finger print readers&#34;, build a solid Android device using a low-priced, but powerful chipset, now make sure to use IPS screens, next in Dual Sim capability,  and lastly, offer the device at a great price.  There, you have the BLU line of phones.<br /><br />BLU, Asus (with their line of ZenFones), and other companies are telling the consumer that the phone in their pocket doesn't have to be locked in to (or locked by) your Wireless Carrier and that it doesn't have to cost you the price of a high-end computer.  This is a great trend and I wholeheartedly support it.<br /><br />The BLU Studio 5.0 II is in the lower end BLU's line of phones but it is still impressive for the price.<br /><br />The Good:<br />-  IPS screen means the screen is bright and has good viewing angles<br />-  SIM unlocked means you can use it for any carrier as long as the carrier bands are supported by the cellular chip<br />-  1900 Band for ATT and 1700 band for T-Mobile<br />-  Bloat-free Android 4.2 is fast, efficient, and full of great functionality without the additional crap put in by the major carriers.  Really, do we need TV service from T-Mobile or ATT?<br />- Solid build.  Doesn't feel flimsy in your hand<br />- Includes silicone case.<br />- Dual Sim:  Have one phone for work and one phone for personal use?  Use one phone for both.  Calls coming to and called from each card are clearly marked to minimize confusion.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />-  Low screen resolution.  Coming from a Galaxy S3, the lower resolution took some getting used to.  If this is important to you, look at the higher end BLU phones.<br />-  No LTE.  To be expected for this price.  No great loss for me since my LTE speeds usually are pretty poor anyway.<br />-  Some bad software settings (Reference my tips)<br />-  When using only 1 SIM card, there is always a warning in the notification bar that a second SIM is not inserted.  Hopefully, they will address this with an update.<br /><br />TIPS:<br />-  Set the APN.  The phone comes with a single APN pre-programmed, which is selected by default.  The APN is the address that the phone passes through to get to the Internet.  If you are having a problem with network connection, go in to Settings &#62; Data Networks &#62; Access Point Names and choose the APN for your carrier.  Don't tap on the name of the APN, tap on the radio button to the right of it and make sure the bubble is filled in.<br /><br />-  Only SIM1 can access the HSDPA+ network while the other SIM is limited to the EDGE network.  This is not really an issue since only the Android OS will only use 1 SIM to access the Internet.  You choose which SIM card ALL network traffic will go through so basically put the SIM that has the higher data limit in the SIM1 slot.<br /><br />-  Rename the SIM cards in your settings to better differentiate the sim cards.  Also select to display the SIM cards using the last 4 digits instead of the first 4 (three of which is your area code).<br /><br />So in summary, this is a solid phone with solid support for &#34;mobile&#34; usage (not so great for those who use their phone in lieu of a computer for everything they do on the Internet).  The truth that Samsung doesn't want you to know is that there is really nothing on Android that requires an octacore CPU, or even takes advantage of it.  In fact, while I have not tested XBMC on this phone, my Android HDMI Stick that also has the Mali 400 supports more codecs than Samsung's video chip.",1404768065000,13,True

I hardly charge the phone through the USB port so I have no reference as to how long it SHOULD take, but I don't find myself thinking that the charging takes too long.  The charge time is probably helped by the Docooler charger since it as a full 1 amp output.<br /><br />As a bonus, the contacts are carried over to the back side of the Zitrades pad, allowing the chip in the S-view case to work.<br /><br />The final result is that there is a slight bulge to the back of the phone, and a spot that pokes out where the S-View case's chip sits, but the case still fits tightly and the S-View function works.<br /><br />I'm taking one star off because the answers above insist that NFC still works with this pad...  it does not.

3.0,"Easy to install, good quality compared to other kits.","My first time repairing glass on a phone and it went pretty well, thanks to the S3 ProKit.<br /><br />The Glass:<br />-  Slightly tinted as it should be.  Another kit my friend bought had completely clear glass.  After installation, the clear glass looked drastically different from the original.<br />-  Thinner than the original and slightly flexible.  I wasn’t expecting Gorilla Glass here, but the flexibility presents a small problem.  If you have a tight case on the phone, it will cause the glass to cave in, creating a dark spot where the glass touches the lcd screen.<br />-  Has the logo.<br />-  Touch function was not affected after the replacement.<br /><br />The ProKit adhesive:<br />-  Compared to another kit that came with 3M adhesive, the ProKit’s design made it easy to apply.<br />  1.  Remove the paper from the adhesive.  You are now left with a clear blue film with the double-sided tape around the edges.<br />  2.  Pull the home/back button ribbon through the hole in the blue film (as described in the instructions)<br />  3.  Position the blue film as closely to the edges of the phone as possible and apply it in place.<br />  4.  The blue film is pre-cut in the top right corner.  Use that corner to peel the blue film off.  Adhesive is now in place.<br />-  While the size of the adhesive is correct for the phone, there should have been more of it (I’ll explain below)<br /><br />The Toolkit:<br />-  Bunch of plastic and a couple of small screw drivers.  Not much need to be said about them.  They work.<br />-  My suggestion is not to use the tools to try and pry up the glass.  Start by using the suction cup near a corner and heat the adhesive there.  Use the cup to pull the glass up enough to jam the guitar pick in.<br /><br />The Instructions:<br />-  Instructions were in color and were pretty clear to me.  Combine this with a couple of youtube videos and it should be clear how to replace the glass.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />The kit does well to replace the original glass.  Obviously, you will not get the same quality glass as the original but the phone will “look right” after the replacement.  My big problem with this kit is that I keep the phone in my front pocket and dust gets under the glass.  A lot of it.  Had the adhesive surrounded the home button rather than leaving the seams of the button open, the dust would probably not get in.",1404319605000,5,False
5.0,iOttie continues its great line of One Touch mounts,"When I upgraded my phone to a Note 3, its larger size forced me to upgrade my car mount as well.  After my great experience with the original iOttie One Touch, I didn’t look beyond the iOttie brand so my choice was now between the iOttie XL and the iOttie One Touch 2.<br /><br />With a $5 difference between the two, was the price difference justified?  For me, the answer was “yes”.<br /><br />Building on the stand out features (namely, the soft suction cup/adhesive combination and the one touch dock and release system) of the original One Touch, iOttie made a couple of changes to the design that solves yet another problem that I didn’t realize I had -- specifically, how far I needed to lean in to access the phone.<br /><br />The first significant change is the extension arm.  The advantage of this arm is to give you the ability to place the phone closer to you.  When mounted on my dashboard near the wheel’s 2 o’clock position, I’m now able to extend the phone to about 3 inches from my hand.  This distance gives enough clearance to turn the wheel, but still close enough for me to touch the screen without taking my hands off the wheel, and without having to lean in.<br /><br />No leaning in means I don’t take my eyes off the road longer than necessary when checking navigation waypoints or answering calls.  Not taking my hands off the steering wheel means my arm is more stabilized so I’m actually able to hit the buttons I was aiming for.<br /><br />The second significant change is that the joint connecting the phone clip to the mount base is now a ball joint.  It gives a bigger range of movement to the phone clip, making it adjustable to any angle.<br /><br />The distance between the mount’s clamps is only slightly wider than the Note 3 itself so a Note 3 with a slim case can fit, but forget about trying to get a Note 3 with an Otterbox case in there.<br /><br />Overall, the One Touch 2 is a worthy successor to the One Touch and One Touch XL.  Well worth the extra $5 in price.",1404261718000,1,True

5.0,"Comfy, stretchy, stylish","This band looks just like the photo and fits my Apple Watch 7 45mm perfectly.  It is adjustable and will fit thin and average wrists, but will have to stretch on big/thick wrists.  It may not be comfortable if you have huge wrists.  The metal clasp has a brushed finish (rather than high polish) which is nice because small scratches aren’t so noticeable.  The material is very stretchy (like a hairband almost) and comfortable.  Since it’s going to be stretching often as you wear/remove it, you might want to buy a second one if you like it.  Watch bands (except high quality solid metal) don’t last forever and even after only 1 year of normal wear my $100 Apple watch band (magnetic) looks very worn, and one of the connectors has broken.

5.0,Maybe the best looking case for iPhone,"This is easily the best looking case among the clear/mostly clear group of cases I’ve seen and/or tried.  It’s surprising how many ugly, clunky rubber phone cases exist and why anyone would spend $1000+ on a beautiful new device and then throw an ugly colored rubber case on it to make it look like a child’s toy.  If you want a case that offers some protection but also preserves the original look of your phone…THIS is it.  Anyway, the case looks just like the display image - shiny metallic edges/sides with a clear and VERY matte back to hide minor scratches and fingerprints.  The Apple logo is still easily visible, though.  Even though the sides are glossy and look like polished metal, they are made of hard rubber and are more grippy (unless your hands are oily) than they look.  I think the case would provide mild to moderate impact protection, but not as much as one of the big clunky rubber cases.  It’s not a big rugged case.  This case may be tagged as slim, but it is not the slimmest, either. There is a slimmer semi-hard clear plastic case available on Amazon (under various brand names) which is slimmer, but it scratches and cracks easily (I owned that case too) and just doesn’t look as good as this case does.  The edges of this case around the screen and camera are raised by a couple mm to provide some protection.  The back is thick enough that MagSafe accessories will not really stick to the phone, though. It can still charge wirelessly with this case on, but you will barely notice any pull from MagSafe accessories.  If you have a magnetic charging stand that is angled (maybe 45-60 degrees) your phone will NOT stick to it with this case on.  The case seems to be sealed well and doesn’t get moisture spots inside when in humid areas like the bathroom.  One amazing thing about this case is the precisely cut holes and button molds.  The cutouts for the charging port and the side mute switch are cut EXACTLY and evenly - not even a half mm off, so they are centered perfectly.  The cutouts also leave enough space around the charging port for a cable’s surrounding frame, and enough space that your finger can easily toggle the mute button.  The speaker holes are cut perfectly, too.  The button molds are raised just enough that you can feel them with your fingers (so you are not fumbling around trying to locate them) but do not protrude very much, allowing this case to slide easily in and out of your pockets.  I’m really amazed at how they got all of these little details right.  I would definitely recommend this case if you want a sleek, beautiful case that provides a bit of protection.  I wish they would make a MagSafe version of this case - possibly with rings painted to match the phone paint so they are nearly invisible.",1653888176366,1,True
3.0,"No bubbles, partial screen coverage, lines","Overall, I this was a MEH screen protector in my opinion - BUT still better than the last 3 screen protectors I've bought.  It has a good installation video guide, and I was able to install it with zero bubbles on my first try.  I think most people (who actually *watch* the video and follow their method) can do it, too.  However, I'm disappointed in the ugly lines near the middle third of the screen - check out the attached photo to see what I mean.  You will see those same lines with almost all of the other plastic film style protectors, though, to be fair.  The other thing I'm disappointed in is that this doesn't cover the whole screen - you can see the edges on each side are not covered.  This film is simply smaller than the 45mm screen by at least a few mm on each side.  You can see how much smaller it is in the photo.  When you are swiping from the side, to change your watch face, for example, you feel that annoying edge of the film.  I'm not sure why it's so hard for companies to make a film that fits the watch, but it certainly doesn't feel like 2022 when it comes to watch screen protectors.  The only one that was a close fit for the screen had a thick black border that actually covers the edges of the screen, and was impossible to install without bubbles.  Don't buy that one!<br /><br />Anyway, this film protector is better than nothing, for sure, especially if you wear your watch to the gym or anywhere where it can be scratched.  Remember - only the high end ($1000ish) apple watches have the sapphire screens - not all models.  So unless you have that model, your screen will almost definitely scratch without a screen protector.",1643431489276,3,True
3.0,Good band but missing connector pins,"The band looks nice (like the photo) but the package is missing the connector pins to connect the Watch band to the Watch head, and as a result I had to order them separately and the band (a gift) couldn’t be used or worn as given.  I dropped the rating by 2 stars as a result.  If you buy this, you may need to also order two (20mm for Galaxy Watch 4) push-slide connector pins in order to connect this band to your watch.<br /><br />The package contains link-remover tools (with 2 extra heads) also.  The chrome finish on the band looks nice on both sides but the inside of the band clasp has a rough unfinished look.  It is unlikely anyone will ever notice that though since the clasp is always closed when worn.  None of the fake diamonds are missing and I have to say that the band looks really nice with a silver/metal/chrome watch, especially for this low price.

Also you CAN’T just lift it off and try again because the inside is coated with a very sticky tape/glue layer.  2 - This does NOT fit perfectly on a 45mm Apple Watch screen.  It’s slightly smaller and you can see the ugly black borders cut off the edges of the Watch display.  Look at the photo.  Whoever designed this product….should not be designing anything!

5.0,Nice metal band for the price,"I ordered the 7-section metal band in black, and am fairly happy overall with it.  The small glossy in-between parts of the link appear darker than the matte/satin finished parts of the link.  In fact, the matte parts look almost more like charcoal gray rather than black.  While the contrast of the two looks nice (in my opinion) this band will probably not look like an EXACT color match if you have a glossy black watch case.  The links are easy  enough to remove with the tool provided and should be able to fit 99% of wrist sizes.  The band snaps in easily enough to the watch base, and the clasp buckles securely and requires you to press the two side buttons on the sides of the clasp to release, so the watch band doesn't accidentally come undone.  That solves one of the major problems that many other watch bands have, especially magnetic ones.<br /><br />The minor drawbacks to this watch band are:  1 - it sometimes pulls at the the hairs on your arm/wrist like many metal watch bands do  2 - the metal links are a LITTLE wiggly and make a bit of noise.  If you've ever owned a very expensive watch you know that expensive metal watch bands feel more ""premium"" and don't really rattle this way.<br /><br />Given the price, I'm skeptical about how long the paint will last.  If it rubs off quickly, I will edit this review and drop the rating.  If not, I think this watch band deserves a solid 5 stars considering it's low price point - for this much money you really can't ask for more.",1638802668656,0,True

There is a thin camera bump cover and raised edges of maybe 1 or 2mm on the front, but that’s about it.  Protection will be minimal (but more than no case) with this case, so expect damage from major drops.  However, if you are a careful person and rarely drop your phone AND want an ULTRA slim clear case, this is for you.

4.0,Watch out for finger prints on the glue side,"Relatively easy to do. Instructions were generic and did not match the product. Did not see a video link to follow; but found similar. Only trouble I had was that i didnt realize that the green film on sticky-side was not covering the whole piece of glass.  It had cut outs where the lenses and sensors were located (See photo). So when handling the glass I unfortunately transferred finger prints and smudges to the glass, which resulted in poor picture quality.  Fortunately this kit came with two pieces of glass and I got to do the process all over again :-/  but it wasnt bad. Just tedious.  After using the tweezers to pull out the glass and glue from the original broken glass, I actually carefully vacuumed up any bits off the phone.  I then used a Q-tip and adhesive remover to remove the residue left.  Again, slow and careful.  I also squeezed out the Q-tip so it wasn't dripping.  Before placing on the knew glass, I debated whether or not to whipe off the lenses. I did and it was fine.  I tested the camera focus in both modes as suggested,  then put on the glass.  The second time I did it, I made sure there was no dust or smudges on the glue side of the lenses before I removed the film. I even wiped it down and used dust sticker",1620074647222,0,True
2.0,"Overpriced,Lacks Compatibility, Blocks Antenna","I’ve had the Razer Kishi for a few days now and I have to say that I am disappointed.  It works great with Fortnite on my Samsung Note 8.  Does not work with Call of Duty.  There is apparently a work-a-round (connect an xbox controller wirelessly to your phone and then the game will respond to the Kishi); however, for an $80 controller, it should work.  Games that have normal controller support (like Sega’s Altered Beast for example) do not work with it.  The Kishi is advertised on Microsoft’s website as THE controller for cloud gaming via Xbox Game Pass with an Ultimate subscription.  For something that is already overpriced, having to fork out more cash to play “compatible” games is another downside.<br /><br />As I already indicated, the controller is way overpriced $$$.  Wired Xbox controllers are going for $30.  The selling point of the Kishi is low-latency mobile gaming via the USB-C connection; however, for $80 there should be a Bluetooth option.<br /><br />Speaking of Bluetooth, because the controller does not provide a passthrough analog headphone jack, you are forced to use wireless headphones.  More $$$ to spend.<br />Another downside is that the pass-through USB-C connector is for charging only.  So you can’t use it as a USB-C digital audio connection.<br /><br />Like the switch, holding the Kishi is sometimes awkward.  You hold it with your fingers. Your palms have nowhere to rest.<br /><br />Although not advertised to do so, when you connect the Kishi to a PC, it does not appear as an xbox controller.  The button mappings are mostly different as well.  First, the left and right trigger buttons are not even analog.  They are digital.  They show up as buttons 15 and 16 instead of +Z and -Z Axis.  The Xbox button, menu button, and view buttons don’t even map the same.  The only buttons that do match are the directional pad.<br /><br />As I figure more things out (and more support is added) I will update my review.  But, for now, it is what it is...<br /><br />[Update]<br /><br />Wifi signal is significantly weakened when the Kishi is on the device.  Makes the phone unusable with games connected to the internet.",1609552764912,0,True

3.0,Functional With Some Issues,"Would like to give this a 3.5 stars so I opted for three instead of four. I had the old Demy that Key Ingredient first came out with. I loved it until it finally died. Then it revived itself, but I couldn't get any uploads. In any event I thought I'd give this a try.<br /><br />I like that it immediately went and got all my info as soon as it was connected wirelessly. What I don't like is that instead of storing your recipes on the machine it is storing them in the cloud and therefore you have to always have a connection to get to your stuff. This is great, but when the Zombie Apocalypse comes, I may not have a connection, but I still might want to cook. :))<br /><br />I absolutely hate the new format that lists the recipes with their pictures, instead of just an alphabetical text listing. I don't have pics on most of mine because it's a pain to upload them. Now you have to scroll down through all these graphics to see the tiny titles beneath. If someone figures out a way to change this I would be interested to know.<br /><br />It operates very much like an Android phone so if you have one of those you won't have a lot of trouble getting around. The printed instruction manual is useless since it was written in China by folks that don't have a great grasp of the language and pigeon English isn't my native tongue.<br /><br />There is a nice feature that I got all excited about called Recipe Snap, that allows you to use the camera on the device to take a picture of a recipe and then upload it for transposing. Great idea except that it costs 1.00 each time you want to do that and can take up to seven days to show up. How helpful is that??? I have hundreds of recipes that need entered, so I guess I will be doing it the hard way through the website.<br /><br />Speaking of the website, it is probably one of the slowest I have ever encountered for doing data entry.<br /><br />The voice feature is an interesting twist in this new machine. It may be helpful if you can hear it. I have mine turned up as loud as it will go, and it is still kind of hard to hear over my commercial grade exhaust fan. I like that you can pause it, do a step and then start it again.<br /><br />Need to look for some screen covers as this seems more fragile than the screen on the old model and it is already splashed and messy after one day.<br /><br />All in all I am glad I got this for a reduced price and I think it will work fine once I get all the outstanding recipes caught up and entered. I would not have paid the original 150.00 asking price. I just noticed that Key Ingredient has lowered the price on their website to the same one as here on Amazon.",1417355889000,11,True

And now my Apple watch is taking forever to charge. The watch is less than a year old, and generally took no less than 30-40 min to reach a full charge (from about 20-30%), now it takes my watch over an hour and a half to charge from that same percentage!

5.0,Great iPhone 14 Pro Privacy Screen Protector Set,When we invest what we do in an iPhone it’s important to protect the most vulnerable part of the device which is the screen.  I always keep tempered glass protectors on my iPhones to protect the screen - I have one placed on my phone prior to ever using it for the first time.<br /><br />I used this set with my iPhone 14 Pro and they held up incredibly well.  I tend to be rough on my phone - I don’t try to be but I just have crazy things happen.<br /><br />These screens have saved my having to have the screen replaced more times than I can count.  From drops to carrying my phone in my pocket with other items these screens worked exactly as they are intended.<br /><br />They are easy to apply - the key is to make sure your iPhone screen is completely clean and free of dust particles.  The set comes with everything you’ll need.<br /><br />These privacy screens can take a bit of getting used to as your screen will only be visible from straight on - this can be a benefit and a hinderance.  Often I was used to glancing at my phone when I had a notification but with this protector I must most often actually lift my phone to look at it.<br /><br />Something I have learned with screen protectors that seems specific to the last couple generations is if it is listed as edge to edge where the screen protector wraps around the edge of the screen issues arise with cases.  This is the type of screen protector you want - look for “phone case friendly.”  This set has proven excellent.<br /><br />I have had no issues with these protectors on my iPhone 14 Pro.<br /><br />This is an outstanding deal for 2 screen protectors that you can count on to protect your investment.,1667824592557,0,False

4.0,OK iPhone 13 Pro Max Case but Not Great,"After purchasing my iPhone 13 Pro Max I knew it was critical to get a case immediately to protect my investment.<br /><br />I have used this case for multiple months and it works.  Here are a few things you need to know - do not purchase the screen protectors that descriptions read “edge to edge” as the case will cause them to peal away. You want to look for screen protectors that descriptions read “case friendly.”  The same applies to the camera protectors.  The case will protect the camera lenses to a degree though if you are hard on your phone, as I am on mine, get the protectors.<br /><br />The MagSafe accessories will not work well with this case.  Some will work better than others - I have found the higher quality battery packs work well though I have yet to find a magnetic wallet that I would trust to remain attached.<br /><br />This is a case I would recommend as a backup.  Not bad but also not great.",1658411906119,0,False
2.0,Poor Case for iPhone 13 Pro Max,After purchasing my iPhone 13 Pro Max I knew it was critical to get a case immediately to protect my investment.<br /><br />I knew quickly this was not going to be a case that would work for me as the built in screen caused the phone to be far less responsive than I expect.  Often I find this to be the case unless the built on screens are produced with the utmost care to take this into account.<br /><br />In addition MagSafe accessories will not work with this case which was a deal breaker for me.<br /><br />This is not a case I would recommend.,1658411269200,0,False

The ports were reinforced where the wires entered, the gauge of the wire was adequate for the amount of current.<br /><br />Unfortunately after about a month this cable began having intermittent issues.  I would plug something in to charge overnight only to find it only partially charged in the morning.<br /><br />By the third month this had become the norm.  I decided to charge my phone with this so I could hear when it connected and disconnected and it was indeed not maintaining a solid connection for no known reason beyond the cable itself.<br /><br />After thoroughly testing this cable I have found it unreliable and not one I can recommend.",1658405730959,0,False

Ugh.<br /><br />Lesson learned - first buy your case and then fit the camera protector after.

2.0,Disappointing Results with Case,After I purchased my iPhone 13 Pro Max I wanted to try the MagSafe products - after testing several I have learned quite a bit about the limitations.<br /><br />What I have found is these will work great for those who do not require a case on their phone.<br /><br />Even cases that claim to be MagSafe compatible will greatly reduce the ability of the magnet to adhere to the back of the phone.  This is one thing when it’s a charger but a whole other when you are expecting it to hold cash or cards.<br /><br />I definitely would not depend on this to remain attached if you have any case on your phone.,1658060397215,0,False
5.0,EXCELLENT DEPENDABLE CHARGING STATION - with DIGITAL DISPLAY,"With so many products being either powered by or recharged via USB having one of these multi port charging stations really comes in handy.<br /><br />I installed this unit to the inside of my desk drawer utilizing heavy duty double sided mounting tape.  This has allowed me to plug in multiple PC accessories that require power but do not utilize USB to transmit data to my PC without occupying my PCs USB ports.<br /><br />Having 5 ports means I always have a port to plug my iPhone, iPad, headphones and myriad of other USB charged devices without having to search for another USB plug.<br /><br />I’ve found that this station provides dependable 2.4A to the 4 outlets and the QC 3.0 outlet will charge my iPad far more quickly than other outlets.<br /><br />I’ve had no issues with over charging where my devices get hot - and having the digital display allows me to monitor what the charger is actually doing which is a great feature.<br /><br />This is a well built, dependable charging station that I’ve thoroughly enjoyed using every day over the last couple of months and have had zero issues from.<br /><br />Highly recommend.",1654055760424,0,False
2.0,Disappointing RGB Qi Charger,"As someone who loves colored lights and all tech things I was excited to test and review this RGB Qi charger. I’ve been using it for a couple of months and have been really disappointed with the quality.<br /><br />In terms of design there are some facets that are quite good - your phone can charge through even a beefy case which is often not the case with Qi chargers, a definite plus.  In addition, you can charge your phone in either a vertical or horizontal position, which is great if you want to use the phone while charging.<br /><br />The ports on the back are handy for charging other devices as to keep everything contained and they work well.  It’s handy that a super fast USB C port is included as this is the newest of charging technologies and definitely the fastest.<br /><br />Now on to the flaws in this device.  When manufacturing an RGB device why not have the colors mean something?  The light below the phone turns white when the phone is placed on the charger, white while charging and white when completed charging.  Seems like this would be an ideal opportunity to make use of the RGB lights in a functional way.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the noise.  Over the course of using this the last couple of months it has become louder and louder. I have cleaned the vents yet the sound persists.  I started with this on my nightstand therefore this was definitely an issue.  The sounds go from a high pitched screech to a lower pitched fan blade rubbing sound - both very irritating.  I have done everything I can to eliminate the sound without success.  After failing at this I moved the charger farther on my nightstand but it still kept me up so I placed it on my desk for use while working.  In the end, the sound is so distracting, the charger is in my drawer and not being used.<br /><br />While this RGB Qi charger could be a great device, my experience has not been indicative of that.  This is not a product I would recommend.",1634216439252,1,False
5.0,Excellent Case Specifically Made for iPhone 11,"While I try to be careful with my iPhone, life just happens.<br /><br />I’m a multimedia sculptor and since my phone is always with me it ends up being jeopardized in odd and crazy ways.  While I don’t necessarily need my case to be able to withstand being at 328 feet under water for 12 hours, the fact that this case is truly waterproof has been a real benefit.<br /><br />This case is tough!  I have owned cases by many manufacturers - OtterBox, Life Proof and many others.  I have seen this case take incredible impacts and falls with absolutely no damage to my phone.<br /><br />All of the buttons and ports are accessible including the mute / silence button.  While the speakers are protected, sound remains unmuffled, clear and excellent.<br /><br />I’ve had no issues using Qi chargers with this case which is unusual with similar protective cases.<br /><br />While previous iPhone cases I’ve had with built in screen protectors were not very responsive, this case’s screen has been both clear and responsive.<br /><br />This case has been superb - it fits perfectly, protects all aspects and still allows for full functionality.<br /><br />This is definitely a case I recommend.",1630903114662,1,False
5.0,Great Screen Protection at a Reasonable Price,I bought other screen protectors thinking they were what I needed for my phone and 2 days later cracked my screen in the small area cut out for the camera at the top.  That was when I researched and found these “Full Coverage Screen Protectors” and I’ve been completely satisfied with these.<br /><br />After that I switched to full face screen protection that includes the self facing camera and I’ve had no problems since then.<br /><br />Now this could just be personal bad luck but if you are looking to protect your phones glass screen I recommend protecting all of the screen including the camera at the top.<br /><br />I worried that there would be some issue in covering the camera that would cause problems with facial recognition but that has never been the case.

Something many of us have had to figure out is a better way to support our phones during these and provide adequate lighting so we can be seen - this will take care of both.<br /><br />By simply clamping this on to the edge of any desk or table and plugging it into any USB outlet you will have a gooseneck phone holder that can be easily positioned anywhere you need it and a small ring light on a separate gooseneck.<br /><br />The ring light’s temperature can be adjusted between a cool (more blue) to neutral to warm (more yellow) light.  And there are 10 degrees of intensity.<br /><br />This is an item that will definitely save your arm and help make your lighting perfect all video calls.<br /><br />This is an all around great product.",1620479821026,0,False
5.0,Awesome Accessory,"I am a huge fan of dual use products.  The less electronics I need taking up valuable desk space the better.  I have always had great luck with Belkin products so when I saw this Qi Wireless Charging Speaker I was excited to test it.<br /><br />I set this up at my home workstation and have absolutely loved it.  I have used it with an iPhone 8 Plus, an iPhone X Pro and my current iPhone 11 Pro - each of them charge flawlessly and connect to the Bluetooth speaker without any problem.<br /><br />I can not speak to how well they would work through bulky cases as I don’t use them.  I opt for thinner cases which I have found provide adequate protection for me and never disrupt wireless charging abilities.<br /><br />There are several characteristics I like about this unit.  I certainly would recommend the 10W version.  I have found with all Qi chargers not all of the power is going to transfer due to the loss through it being wireless.  This isn’t a huge deal if you are using a wireless charger overnight but if you are like me, and have times where you need to get charged rather quickly, this pays off.<br /><br />The Bluetooth speaker is great for FaceTime calls (or video calling such as Zoom). Rather than being dependent on your phones speakers to hear the person you are speaking to the devices speaker and microphone take over producing far better sound quality on both ends.<br /><br />I often use this little speaker for listening to audiobooks as I work and it works great for that.  Now this doesn’t have the sound quality of a Bose speaker but I didn’t expect that.  In relation to the size the sound quality is really quite good.<br /><br />I have tested this product for three months now which is how long I’ve found is required to fully evaluate a product to see if it will develop issues and then be outside of the return window.  We have all had that unpleasant experience.<br /><br />I can definitely recommend this 10W Belkin Qi Wireless Charging Speaker.  It has proven to be a well made, very useful device that will continue to reside on my workstation for daily use.",1607267389579,1,False

5.0,AWESOME WAY to SANITIZE & CHARGE your PHONE,"Like most people I have seen the many reports about just how many germs we carry on our phones.  It only makes sense - we carry them everywhere and often don’t think about wiping them down.<br /><br />This phone sterilizer by SMARTURTLE is a great solution to this issue. By getting in the habit of using this to charge and sterilize your phone each day you’ll be guaranteed to carry around far fewer germs.<br /><br />Within the sterilizer box there is a Qi charger which I’ve found works without any issue.  After plugging the unit in you’ll be greeted with a voice welcoming you.  Place your phone or any other object of similar size or smaller within and press the button on the left.  The unit will say disinfection in process - the UV light will illuminate and run through the cycle.  There is a button to the right that allows for the use of aromatherapy oils if you wish to freshen scent.<br /><br />Ultra Violet light, such as used by this unit, is what hospitals often use to decontaminate equipment.  It has been clinically proven to kill 99.9% of germs and bacteria.  The size of this unit is ideal easily fitting both our iPhone 8 Plus or iPhone X Plus with their cases still on.<br /><br />We have thoroughly enjoyed having this product and feel this is an easy way to keep our phones free of harmful germs and bacteria.

1.0,Stylus Pen Doesn’t Work With My 2018 iPad,"Prior to ordering I specifically double checked that this stylus would work with my 2018 iPad Pro - the listing indicates it is compatible.<br /><br />I charged it completely - the micro USB can be a bit tricky getting it to fit within the “eraser” end but after wiggling I got it to fit.<br /><br />I’ve troubleshot this far more than should be necessary and, as stated, there is no way to connect via Bluetooth and I simply have zero response from the pen when trying to use it on my iPad.

5.0,Tiny Bank with Super Fast Charging,"Having you cellphone or other USB rechargeable device run out of power when away from any ability to charge it has happened to most of us and it is always inconvenient.

3.0,Charging as Easy as Laying your Device Down but...,"I have reviewed numbers Qi wireless charging stations but none previously from this particular company.<br /><br />In terms of function, this mouse pad does charge my iPhone X.  I tend to always use minimalist cases which when it comes to Qi charging makes a HUGE difference.  The thicker or more dense the case the slower the Qi charging will be as it has to first penetrate the case.  While some cases block Qi charging all together others just slow it down dramatically.<br /><br />I tested this Qi charger with my case and without and found charging speed a little faster without but not significantly so.<br /><br />In comparison to other Qi charging units I have this one is not super fast, but I also would not classify it as ultra slow.  In terms of speed I find it average.<br /><br />It is decently well made.  The color is pleasant and I like that it has the charging LED lights and over charge / heat protections.<br /><br />In terms of use I wasn’t fond of having my phone on my mouse pad.  I found myself bumping into it with the mouse and, unless you have a very small desk surface, what’s the point?  I have a Qi charger that is a picture frame so when at my desk my phone rests there - when I receive a text or call all I have to do is glance down to see the notification.<br /><br />I did decide to put this one in my laptop case so when I travel I will have it to use.

4.0,FINALLY CLEAR HANDSFREE CALLING IN MY CAR!,While I love my car the built in Bluetooth microphone for calling is awful. Every time I have attempted to use it people I have called can not hear me and I spend the entire conversation screaming and repeating myself. Finally I just gave up and stopped having my phone connect to that “modern convenience.”<br /><br />This visor handsfree assistant by SUNITEC is a perfect answer for what I needed.  It clips right to the sun visor above where I sit and the built in microphone is terrific.<br /><br />This device is so easy to use and well designed.  Once paired with your phone it will auto connect when you are in range without you having to do anything but only uses the built in battery when actually in use.  After a conversation is finished or it is finished playing audio it will automatically go into standby mode which saves the battery life.<br /><br />I have loved that I can have directions come through this speaker so they do not have to blare over my stereo speakers interrupting my audiobook or music.<br /><br />This is an outstanding device that is effortless to use and really helps keeps your eyes on the road even when you receive or make a call while driving.<br /><br />This is definitely a product I would recommend.,1587505560661,0,False
2.0,Average minimalist case with reasonable protection at a good price!,"I have tried, tested and reviewed more phone cases than I can remember at this point.  This is the second Speck Case I’ve had the opportunity to review and, in relation to minimalist cases, this one is decent.<br /><br />Firstly, it fits my iPhone 11 perfectly - all buttons work, switches are easily accessible, cable ports free of obstruction and sound ports are unblocked.<br /><br />The case is softer than many and while it withstood our minimal stress tests it will not provide a great deal of added protection.<br /><br />The corners and surrounding edges are reinforced rubber - providing adequate protection if impacted there.  As with many similar cases, Emerge utilizes a small air pocket area under each corner which provides a buffer in case of a direct corner impact.<br /><br />The case stands .5mm above the LCD screen providing minimal protection if it was a flat face fall.<br /><br />This case is truly crystal clear. While many of these cases have a hint of color this one is clear allowing the color of your phone to shine through.<br /><br />As with all minimalist cases, it adds very little bulk or weight and will provide a minimal amount, yet necessary, added protection.  This is not the case for a teenager or someone who is rough on their phone but it will work great for many people.<br /><br />I have used a minimalist case for years without incident and look forward to using this one from Speck.",1584930218744,0,False
5.0,AMAZING CELL PHONE BOOSTER SET for LARGE SIZED HOMES & YARDS!,"There are few things more frustrating than not having a cell phone signal at your home.  Currently many families have dropped their landlines and rely solely on their cell phones so maintaining a strong, dependable signal is more important than ever.<br /><br />I’ve had the opportunity to test and review a few different versions of the HiBoost cell phone signal boosters.  There are some differences between the systems but each of them work really well.  Depending on your specific requirements and area you need to cover, you should determine which set will best suit your needs.<br /><br />This review is specific to the HiBoost 10K Smart Link for coverage of 4,000 - 10,000 square feet.<br /><br />It is important to understand that these systems require INSTALLATION - IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU’LL JUST PLUG IN AND HAVE A BOOST IN YOUR SIGNAL.  That being said, I did not find installation overly difficult - although it did require a bit of time.  YOU WILL HAVE TO GET ON YOUR ROOF AND RUN WIRE.  If you are unwilling to do this, or hire someone to do it for you, this is not a product for you.<br /><br />In regards to this antenna booster set - it is absolutely professional grade.  While there are other “cell phone boosters” that attach to your phone but do nothing this utilizes an exterior antenna that relays the signal to the interior module which then boosts the signal prior to sending it to the interior antenna which provides the entire house (and yard) with a solid signal.  I am far from a cell phone signal expert - I followed the instructions and installed my set and my signal strength more than doubled.<br /><br />I used to have a few dead spots within my house which would drive me crazy - but those are gone.  While I used to have 1-2 bars within my house, I now have a solid 4-5 bars - and no dropped calls.  While it is still true that the farther you move from the interior antenna, or the more obstacles (walls) blocking the signal, the weaker the signal is that you receive, I found with this set, the signal is amplified to such a degree that the loss of signal didn’t hamper reception.<br /><br />This set is PERFECT if your cell signal is weak, or you have dead zones within your home or office, and you need to boost it so you can rely on your cell phone.  This will boost not only your ability to call without reception being lost but data will transfer more quickly and reliably over your cellular service.<br /><br />I can see how this set could be especially helpful for those who travel in an RV or camper.  It would only require hoisting the exterior antenna and fixing the direction in order to pick up the closest cell tower and then regardless of where you are located you will have cell phone reception.<br /><br />Something to note - the app is quite invasive with the information it requires and really does not do anything that can not be done using the LCD screen on the interior unit.  Personally I’m leery of foreign apps that require personal information in order to register them.  Due to the type of device that this is, I was not willing to risk the security breech on my network.  You’ll have to decide if it’s worth the risk for you.<br /><br />In my extensive testing I found that the effective range in real world conditions, such as within my home, through walls, is around 8,500 - 9,500 square feet.  This system boosted my signal not only within my house but also outside onto my decks and well into my yard.  The farther you move from the interior antenna the lesser the boosted signal but I still found a significant boost.<br /><br />I have tested and reviewed several similar products by this brand and others and this one, outperformed all the others.  All of the systems that actually work will have similar installation and set up procedures but in the end this set will provide you the reception that you want and need.<br /><br />This is a very solid, well built system that does what it claims.  While it will require a few hours to set up, I found it well worth the effort.  This is an excellent product that I definitely recommend.<br /><br />⭐️As with all Drew’s Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

5.0,Wow!  The BEST Stylus Pen I’ve Seen!,"As someone who spends a lot of my time in front of a screen working on graphic design or writing I’ve used many stylus pens but this one really is better than any of the others I’ve used.<br /><br />There are many Stylus pens that have a pen on one side and the stylus on the other - this pen is so much more than that.<br /><br />This pen has four distinct tips built into the one unit - each end has a cap with a tip and then beneath those are the other tips.  In addition to that, this set comes complete with a vinyl carrying case and replacement tips for each of the four tips.<br /><br />The Stylus tips are INCREDIBLE.  As someone who does a fair amount of graphic design using a touch screen I have used more Stylus pens than I can remember - this one performs just as well as those that I’ve spent ten times as much on.<br /><br />At first appearance it may seem all Stylus tips are about the same - that is not the case.<br /><br />The basic rubber stylus nub is the perfect density - not giving too much where it flattens and makes too much contact with the screen allowing adequate control.<br /><br />The metal mesh tip is excellent for blending, color editing / correction and general image manipulation within graphic programs.<br /><br />The clear disc tip is AWESOME.  I’ve only used one other Stylus with this tip design and I LOVE it!  The clear disc allows you to look from the side to see exactly when the tiny stylus tip is making contact.  This is ideal for any fine detail work.<br /><br />Finally, the ball point pen tip is handy when you have to sign something or jot a note onto real paper.<br /><br />This is an incredible multi-use Stylus that, if you spend much time working on any touch screen - you will love.  In addition, this would make an awesome gift for any graduate, graphic designer or photographer who does photo editing.<br /><br />I absolutely love this product and highly recommend it.<br /><br />⭐️As with all Drew’s Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

4.0,AWESOME 3 Way Mountable Car Phone Holder with FAST Qi Charging!,"[[VIDEOID:d00a098401fdbf75993b74498effdac1]] I have tried, tested and reviewed several car cell phone holders and this one is definitely one of the best ones.<br /><br />Assembly and installation was quick and straightforward.<br /><br />The unit can be mounted via three different methods within your vehicle.  The set comes complete with 3 different brackets: a gooseneck stand that is attached to a cup sized weight, allowing the stand to rest within a cup holder; on a vent clip bracket, allowing for either vertical or horizontal mounting; or on a bracket that can be attached via 3M double sided foam tape to any smooth surface within your vehicle.<br /><br />I tested each method and they all worked perfectly.  For the cup holder method, when you twist the cup from the neck, three wings extend which help snug it within your cup holder. The vent clip worked equally well securing tightly to my air-vent without falling as we traveled.  The third bracket mentioned that can be attached to smooth surfaces has the same ball joint at the other end allowing for complete control of viewing angle.<br /><br />The bottom feet of the phone cradle are easy to adjust so the Qi charger falls at the correct level to charge your phone.<br /><br />Once plugged in the side arms immediately open to accept the phone as it detects motion in front of the phone charging cradle.  Once the phone is placed a light sensor detects the phone and automatically secures the phone by the arms squeezing inward. To release you simply touch the small metal sensor on either side.<br /><br />The Bolt Car Mount has an internal battery so even if you cut the power to the unit, it will still open the arms by pressing the button.<br /><br />THIS SET DOES NOT INCLUDE AN USB 3.0 CAR CHARGER - while many other sets do. Power can be delivered by either a Micro USB Cable (not included) or a USB C Cable (included).<br /><br />The average charging speed in my tests using my iPhone 8 Plus was 6% per 10 minutes - on par with other similar devices.<br /><br />This is a very high quality set complete with 3 brackets allowing for multiple ways to mount for less expense than similar sets that only include one mounting method.  While it does not come complete with the USB 3.0 Power Adapter, many vehicles do not require that as USB ports are built in to newer vehicles.<br /><br />This Qi Charging Set for vehicles is among the very best I have had the opportunity to review and at this price point I would not hesitate to recommend it.<br /><br />⭐️As with all Drew’s Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

4.0,Why occupy your space with a boring charger?  Now your favorite picture can do it!,"This is one of the coolest new products I’ve seen for a while - and it works GREAT.<br /><br />As soon as I saw it, I thought, why has no one thought of doing this before!!!<br /><br />The frame is a beautiful, modern black wood frame that holds a 5x7 picture.  The photo has to be portrait oriented as the frame must stand on the smaller side.<br /><br />The Qi charger that is built into the frame charges at up to 10 watts depending on what wattage adapter the power cord is plugged into.  The power cord was more than long enough for me to reach my adapter with ease.<br /><br />The frame accommodates my iPhone 8 Plus in its Lifeproof SLAM Series case (and would in other minimalist cases) but if you use bulkier cases, such as an Otterbox Defender on an iPhone Plus (or similar sized phone) it will not fit.<br /><br />The lights on the reverse side of the frame indicate when your device is charging (blue), fully charged (green) or if there is a foreign object interfering with charging, such as a metal plate or if your case was too thick (flashing blue).<br /><br />Based on the complaints I read, I recommend people measure their phone within their case to make sure it falls within the 165mm height restriction.  Typically if your case falls within that it will not have a back thicker than 3mm.<br /><br />The only thing that I would improve on this product would be to add a small mat and make the frame a little larger to accommodate phones with slightly bulkier cases.<br /><br />As far as my tests went, I found this to be an awesome product that worked flawlessly.  The frame is beautiful with zero defects and beautiful craftsmanship.  My phone charged super fast and rested securely within the frame.<br /><br />I am thoroughly impressed with this product and will enjoy having it on my desk.",1557597601069,5,False
2.0,"Solid, nice looking case - but minimal, if any, screen protection.","I have tried, tested and reviewed more phone cases than I can remember at this point.  This is the first Emerge Case I’ve had the opportunity to review and it definitely has some strong points but it also misses the mark in a few critical aspects.<br /><br />Firstly, it fits my iPhone 8 Plus perfectly - all buttons work, switches are easily accessible, cable ports free of obstacle and sound ports are unobstructed.<br /><br />The case is definitely hard and withstood our stress tests without issue.  Emerge utilizes a honeycomb pattern with their plastic manufacturing of this case making it extremely rigid and strong. The corners are reinforced and would provide adequate protection if impacted there.<br /><br />The black and silver is a classic, clean look that will always be in style.<br /><br />While Emerge bills this as a Grip Case our tests found that this case is actually harder to grip than any of the other 5 we tested.  While there is a slight texture cut into the surface the material is hard and tends to slide from the hand while rubberized materials stick.<br /><br />Another area of concern is that this case is nearly completely flush with the LCD glass screen of the phone - providing no protection from a flat face fall.  This fact alone, unfortunately, makes this case a non contender as to one I’d recommend for protection.<br /><br />The LCD glass is the number one thing damaged on mobile phones and should be a primary area any good case protects - this one fails.<br /><br />While this is a really nice looking case and will protect in corner and rear impacts it will not protect the LCD glass screen in any impact to the front.",1557504938951,3,False
4.0,Solid phone case that will provide adequate protection for most people.,"I have tried, tested and reviewed more phone cases than I can remember at this point. As a general rule the Lifeproof brand has stood up to long term use and intense stress tests without fail.<br /><br />This is a solid case that fits well around the iPhone 8 Plus.<br /><br />Installation requires the use of an included Lifeproof key to unsnap the 2 pieces of the case prior to inserting the phone and then snapping it back together.<br /><br />The glass LCD screen is protected from a direct fall by a rubber bumper that stands approximately 1.5mm above the surface.  A glass screen protector should still be applied and that IS NOT INCLUDED.<br /><br />All of the buttons are accessible but require additional pressure to activate - a noticeable amount of additional pressure is required for the volume buttons.  The mute button is approximately 5mm within the side of the case and is a bit difficult to switch.<br /><br />I had no issue plugging an Apple charging cord into the bottom port.<br /><br />Sound comes through the speaker holes at the bottom without issue and the microphone is uncovered allowing for clear pickup on calls.<br /><br />While many Lifeproof cases are known for being completely waterproof - this is not that type of case.<br /><br />While this case does add a minor amount of bulk and weight it is not a burdensome quantity for the protection provided.<br /><br />This is a really sturdy, nice looking case that I think would be ideal for most adults who aren’t particularly rough on their phones.",1557502175289,6,False

This particular test is to see how long it will run the led lights on low. I've had it on continentaly thus far for 8 hours and when I checked how much power the unit had left suprising to me it's still at 4 blue bars which is near 100% and that's amazing! With this who needs candles in an emergency! The test will continue to see how long it can go at this rate I'm sure more than 24 hours continuous. The led panel doesn't even get warm to the touch considering it has been on 8 hours straight. For me just as a backup light it was well worth the money! Would get it just for this feature alone!

5.0,Phone.case is great. Read full review,"My wife loves this case. Mainly because of the magnetic backing.  It will stick and hold to all metal very very well.  The phone even stays in place.  She uses it at her job and will hang her phone so she can use with ease.  She's had zero issues with phone falling out or slipping, it will stay where it's out until she peels it off.  The magnetic properties is the beat feature by far in her opinion.  The card holders and other slots are just a small bonus for her.  The cases finish and look is very sleek and nice.  It seems to hold up well with everyday work use and ahes happy with that as well.  I plan on buying myself one in the near future.

4.0,So far so good. Read full review for details.,"Look honestly this case is ok... do I trust my 800$ phone with a 3' fall.. Hell no..<br />My wife didnt care she wanted dazzle so she got it.  It is pretty and it is a thicker plastic but I still wouldnt trust a simple fall..  it fits her phone perfectly and shipping of course was quick.  Over all it makes my wife smile and that fine with me.  As long as she replaces her phone if it breaks.. lol.<br /><br />I've learned from past experiences if its dazzling pretty, theres a reason and heres how I see it.  If a good phone case, with normal plain colors cost 30$..  then that same good case dazzled up will cost 40$ or more.  There is a reason why the good cases arent dazzled... it will cost to much to make them special and at same time good protection.  we the consumer dont wanna pay the extra $$ for good and dazzled.  So they dazzle the cheap ones to catch your eyes while using a cheaper plastic to meet the price range most peeps will pay.  So either you pick special and cheap or plain and good.. most times you cant have both at a good price.  Just something to think about.<br />Just make sure your aware of the ""inside"" info stated above.  There really is a reason why it's either special of strong and not both.<br />I will update if anything changes.<br /><br />I have not been paid for ANY review I've ever left.

1.0,"DO NOT WASTE $ PLEASE, Please, read my full review for All the full details!","THIS IS A GIMMICK!!!  DO NOT BUY and USE on your  $1000 PHONE!! Heres why,<br /><br />it does not stick to a phone case and heres how I know it's a total waste of 5$ and possibly having to replace tour very expensive phone. There is NO instructuons,( I know it's pretty straight forward but) do you have to press strap to case for a certain amount of time?  Do u need to clean case before applied? Do you not need to clean case before you apply?  Do you have to apply with case hotter than room temp?  Point being,  There should be a little guidance especially when it WILL NOT HOLD!!!  This way I'm not trying 100 different ways thinking it's my fault and not just a cheap piece of junk..<br /><br />Bought a brand new case along with this item. Both came same day in same package.<br />Applied the strap to the NEW phone case and immediately upon sliding 3 fingers between the strap and phone it popped off and 800$ phone went crashing to floor. I'm not happy at all...<br /><br />2nd attempt to get the strap to adhere.<br />Replaced the strap to back of case but this time i held it in place pressing down for 6 or so mins. It popped off again immediately upon putting hand through the strap and phone. ch when it feel so thank god my 800$ phone didnt have a chance to break<br /><br />3rd time i pressed the strap to case for few mins, Then I let it sit for 30 mins without touching case and gave the adhesive time to set. I also made sure that I sat the case and srap in the view of a window so the sun light would hit the adhesive and maybe help hold like it supposed to, time will tell..  after 30 mins of waiting and a warm case. I tried the strap AGAIN.  Upon sliding my hand through the strap and phone YET AGAIN, immediately fell off.  OMG I'm done and sending this P.O.S. back tomorrow morning.  Yea its only 5$ but they DO NOT deserve to keep that money for crap that could cost people even more money when their phone falls to floor and breaks.<br /><br />Lesson learned here guys, when u have an 800$ phone do we really want to trust a 5$ strap??  I could've very easily been replacing my phone because of a cheap a$$ phone strap...<br /><br />DO NOT BUY unless u have a really cheap and replaceable phone.

5.0,Great case sturdy and thick. Just make sure you buy right one (size).,I love Otter Box Cases.  Wish they would love samsung as much as the iphones and sell people the full incased version. But for what it is you cant go wrong..... unless you order the wrong one..  yes i had to return because I bought a case for s10+ and co.e to find out in ordered a s10..  oops.  But I got the exact same case just for right phone.<br /><br />The clearness is amazing if it wasnt for the sparkles you wouldnt know there was a case on the phone.

So far the case is holding up nicely.<br /><br />My wife loves this case, just bought her a new s10, and she is in love with the color and didnt want to cover it up. The clear case with sparkles are right up her ally for sure.  Otter Box is an excellent brand I just wish you cared about samsung as much as you do iphones.  We (samsung) should get the same care and have a full incased Otter Box and not just the backing.<br />I dont have any complaints for what it is very clear see through no scratches of course very well made with thickness fits like a tight glove, easy to install, and most importantly I feel my 600$ phone is protected.<br />If you need a case always choose Otter Box they are beat in business for a reason.",1611359163086,0,True
2.0,IT WILL NOT STAY IN PLACE. Returned as it got worse!,"Updated after few weeks I'm returning the screen protector.  IT MOVES even worse as before it will not stay in one place and it totally useless for the phone.  I wouldnt recomened to anyone for this reason.  Every other protector I've ever used has always sucked to the screen and takes an army to remove, this one is not like that at all, just a push of your finger and it will come off.<br /><br />3 star for one main reason..  the protector DOES NOT stay in place.  It will move around very easily on top of phone screen.  Even with an Otter case, (Samsung) it still moves around with ease.  This is a big issue for me.<br /><br />However it is thick and touch screen works ok (with settings in highest as instructed).  I dont know if it will hold up to their claims on the anti destruction power it's supposed to have and I'm for sure not going to test it to see on a 600$ phone.<br /><br />Im keeping it just in case because you really never know it just may help one day But I'm still very skeptical with the ease of movement of the screen protector.

Despite the fact that this case has a textured back it still fell from my butterfingers but don't worry, the phone and case are fine.",1480728558000,0,True
5.0,Works with MotoMods,"I primarily bought this case for the bumper so I could use a power pack with my Droid Z Force. Unfortunately the back of the battery pack won't make a full connection but can be corrected by trimming alittle off the edge the goes around the back. I have to say I wasn't expecting much but this case is actually decent. It's a two-piece case that consists of a bumper, which is firm but flexible plastic, to cushion the edges of the phone and a hard clear case that secures over the bumper to protect the back.<br />I will say that if you end up using the bumper only, make sure to keep a mod on with it or to set your phone face down to keep it from laying down awkwardly on the phone's camera.",1480726908000,2,True
2.0,Not what it claims to be,"This pen is deceptively nice looking and well packaged. Unfortunately, the palm rejection features on it are absolutely non-existent, and it writes terribly. The device does not recognize it as an apple pencil, so it does not work well at all with the newer Ipad, which in the description it claimed that it did. The writing is terribly inaccurate with awful skips and hit and miss jotting the rest of the time. I could actually write better with a 25 cent stylus than this thing, which, for the price, did not impress me at all. All I can say about it that was positive, is that Amazon was willing to take it back. I now have both a Logitech Crayon and an Apple pencil and am happy with both. There is absolutely no comparison.",1566275881975,0,True
5.0,Even better than I had expected.,"I am so impressed with this pen. I bought a different pen before this one that claimed it worked with the 6th Gen IPad, but that was a joke. I found this one in a news story from Tech Watch and thought if it was good enough for Apple to use with their display models, that had to be positive. I am so happy that I bought this.<br /><br />The pen really does work with this model of IPad. The device even recognizes it as an Apple Pencil. The touch screen sensitivity is amazing and the palm rejection feature works beautifully, allowing you to rest your hand naturally on the screen to write and draw as you normally would on paper.<br /><br />The pen is very easy to set up, light and portable and not all that uncomfortable to use. I like the shape, as it ensures that it doesn’t roll off the desk or other surface when you set it down. The tip is durable and yet doesn’t scratch the front screen of the device, which, I must admit I was worried about with the previous pen I bought.<br /><br />The battery life is pretty good and will let you write or draw for a good number of hours before it needs recharging, which you can do with the lightning cable that comes with the IPad. The top of the pen is connected so you don’t lose it and it doesn’t require you to do anything special to begin using the pen right away. The writing is smooth and you can read your handwriting when you are done writing, a vast improvement over the last pen I tried. There is very little screen lag time and so it feels really natural to use this pen.<br /><br />Overall, for the price, I think this was a great investment. You can also get replacement tips directly from Logitech, 3 in a pack for a reasonable price for when the tip begins to wear down. I am super impressed with this pen. I’d definitely recommend it to other shoppers looking for something that is just as functional as the Apple Pencil, with half the price tag.",1562512422521,6,True

3.0,My first experience with apple.,"Potatoes potaaaatoes pc's and mac's. This is the first apple product I have ever owned. There are things about this phone that I really like. I will get to those first. I like the way you can delete apps from the front screen without having to go into your settings and struggle to find what you are looking for. I think the display is pretty good and the phone itself is quite sturdy. I like the design as I don't accidentally push buttons that turn the phone on and off all the time like I have had problems with on previous phones. I like that you have so many screens and storage folders that you can access on the front screens so you don't have to spend forever looking for where you put something.<br /><br />All of those things are nice, but here are my problems with this phone. I hate that there is no removable media. Good luck and best wishes if you want to add music to your phone you had stored on a previous sd card. With apple it is either feast or famine. You can pay a ridiculous amount to download the music you want from Itunes or you can try as you might to use the itunes software to download the music you did not buy from the apple store. I had around two thousand songs saved onto my previous sd card from my last phone and low and behold, only about ten percent of them successfully made it over to the iphone. I hate that it is ridiculously hard to add pictures to your phone unless you downloaded them from the net or your email or took them from the actual phone camera. I miss having an sd card you can slide out and edit the contents of from your computer. The selection of ringtones that come with the phone are a joke and in order to add new ones, once again (kinda seeing a pattern here) you have to go to itunes on your pc to do so unless you want to pay for them.<br /><br />Often when a phone call comes in, the phone pops speaker phone on and you can't shut it off without disconnecting the call. Sometimes it will refuse to hang up the phone call you are on. occasionally I lose 3g coverage for no apparent reason and the only way to fix this is by shutting off the phone and waiting a few minutes before you turn it back on. If you leave the phone off and don't touch it, the battery will last for days, but if you use it regularly, you had better have a charger nearby. I have had this phone for about six months and wanted to wait until I felt I was used to it before leaving a review. My over all opinion is that it isn't a terrible phone, but for someone who is used to an android device, it is bound to be somewhat frustrating. I would think carefully before getting an iphone about what your needs are and if this phone can fulfill them.",1346735361000,3,False

5.0,Best iPhone Case I've had in years!,"I'm not kidding about this. This is the best iPhone case I've had in as long as I can remember. And I am a case-collecting junkie. For my iPhone X, I had around 20 cases. I change cases based on my mood. Seriously. My wife makes fun of me for me. But it's worth it--because I enjoy case swapping. Here's the thing, since I've gotten this case, I don't swap cases anymore. This case feels SO good in my hand. It's not too smooth or too grippy. Sometimes you just can't quite find that right balance with phone cases. But IMO, Torras nailed it here! The matt-y surface feels so luxurious and doesn't keep much oil/fingerprints (unless they're super greasy). And it just looks like a $50 case or more TBH. I was a little hesitant to spend $20 on it, but I am so glad I found this one. For once, I don't feel like I'm going to have to buy 20 cases for my new current iPhone (12 Pro Max). It's a great feeling to have, because I'm not kidding--it's been an addiction. But I can still tweak the character of the phone a little bit by changing the colors of the buttons. At first, I sported the red buttons, but then I realized I just prefer the black buttons most of the time. Get this case! I promise you'll like it!",1614991366359,49,True

5.0,The search for the perfect 6s Plus case complete!,"I love this case!!! I think the long-winded search for the perfect 6s Plus case is finally complete for me! Before you read on, understand this about me. I am a case nut. My wife makes fun of me because I collect them and swap them out on a weekly, sometimes daily basis. But I change them depending on my mood. I am picky when it comes to cases. And I'd prefer not to have one at all but the phone is so slick and thin and delicate that I'm afraid to not protect it somehow. I'm very careful with my phones. So I like the ultra slim cases. I've had other slim cases like the Totalee and one similar, but that material is just still too slick. No grip. That's why this one is perfect for me. It's like a super slim jacket, yet slightly grippy, adding the perfect amount of grip and elegance to the phone. It covers every part of the phone too. I didn't think I'd like that it covers the ports on the bottom but now that I have it on, I think it looks so slick! Such a great deal on this case. I think I might buy another one in a different color. The material is very flexible, but still stays the on the phone nice and snug. I really think I won't be swapping out cases for some time, maybe never again (until I get the 7). Seriously! Good product guys, and I love the price.

5.0,Looking for a great car mount solution? Look no further!,"This product is so great! It works like a charm. The rubber prongs that attach to the air vent grip so well.

The little magnet piece is even thinner than I thought it would be (it comes with 2, 1 rectangular and one circle). I use very thin, &#34;barely-there&#34; types of cases and it still works great with these. Highly recommend this product if you're tired of iOtties or similar products where you have to use more effort to connect and disconnect your phone from a mount. This is so simple, and if I want to put it in my wife's car, it's an easy move. I might just get her one too because the price is awesome! I paid $8 for this, and 2 years ago I paid $20 for the iOttie, which has fallen down from my dashboard because of really hot or cold temperatures. If you need a good mount, get this now!",1445696056000,0,True
5.0,A great minimal case for those who don't need much protection,"This is exactly the case I've been looking for, for my iPhone 6S Plus. And yes, it fits the 6S Plus just fine. Perfectly snug, covers just enough for my tastes. I'm careful with my phones, and rarely ever drop them. For those who are clumsy with their devices, keep in mind that this case offers very little protection. However, I love the smooth yet grippy feel of the surface. This red wine color I chose looks so sexy on the space gray color. Case is thicker than the camera lens protrusion, so if your phone is flat on the surface, your camera is not touching it. The case is fairly thin, but I love this about it. I've always been a fan of &#34;barely-there&#34; types of cases, I've experimented with Elago and TOTALEE thin cases. This is the best one I've had yet. Highly recommend for those who love thin cases. And a great price! Wow!<br /><br />*Update: I had two cracks in my case that came out of nowhere and showed up only 2 days into use. However, I contacted the customer who promptly responded and kindly provided a promo code so I could place an order for another. That's the kind of customer service that earns 5-star ratings.

The little plastic protector over the Apple logo on the back was worthless though because it creates a bubble seal on some parts of the stainless steel logo which makes it look tacky.

It isn't a huge deal since it does hold the cable well but it would be nice to free up that charger for travel. We have been using it daily for several weeks & have had no performance issues.,1639965964681,2,False
5.0,Truly wireless charging with a single cord,"I got this charger for my mother who recently got an Apple watch. Unlike other charging stands this one requires just a single cord. The watch & airpod charger are both integrated & completely wireless instead of requiring an Apple charger for the watch. She travels a lot & will need to take the cord with her.<br />After reading another review, I followed up with my mother to make sure she didn't experience any problems with the charger. She hadn't experienced any troubles with the chargers or her devices besides not lining up the phone correctly & waking up to an uncharged phone.<br />I love that it uses USB-C for the input, (I'll keep mentioning that in reviews until I quit buying stuff with Micro USB inputs). As much as I appreciate that everything is wireless charging, it would be nice to have a USB port on the back for other accessories. It is a nice looking product with minimalist design. The light is a nice touch.",1594603915898,120,False
5.0,"Fantastic, much better than a power strip","This is a great addition to my work from home desk. It is heavy enough to not get pulled over the side by the cords & it looks much nicer & purposeful than a power strip.

It comes with a heavy, 3-prong cord.",1593445778084,1,False
5.0,Great way to keep everything together & charged every night without a mess of wires tying up plugs,This is a neat charging stand & a great way to keep everything together every day & charged every night without tying up a lot of plugs & having a mess of wires. I wasn't real sure how it worked when we ordered it. The phone charger is genuinely wireless. It does work better on our iPhone SE with the phone on its side but it does fast charge through the case. The watch requires your own wireless charger but provides a nice place to secure it & route the charge cable.<br />The ear pods were the only hangup we had. The earpods case won't charge if it has one of the rubber cases on it. I require the rubber case on my daughter's earpods not for protection but because it has a clip on it & she loses everything.,1591633900847,1,False
5.0,"Snug & low-profile with built up corners, perfect fit for the New iPhone SE",I got this case for my daughter's new 2020 iPhone SE. I wasn't 100% sure whether an iPhone 8 case would fit the SE but this one wrapped around it very nicely. The material is thin & makes for a low profile & the corners are build up heavier to resist dinging in drops. The case she had on her previous phone had a back that was a separate piece for the sides. She prefers this one because it is one piece.<br />I did read that the Apple logo on the back was in a different place on the SE but since this case is clear it didn't matter at all. The picture flash makes the glitter finish look much more prominent than it is.,1591632230469,0,False
5.0,"Soft & Grippy texture, minimal coverage to reduce bulk",This case is a tight-style case that covers the back & sides without being bulky. I like this style for my wife who is responsible & keeps her phone in her purse as opposed to myself who leaves the phone on the hood of the car & needs more coverage. The material is soft & it has a patterned texture on the back for good grip. This is actually the 2nd of 2 iPhone 10s cases I have brought home for my wife's iPhone 10r & unfortunately I haven't been able to put my hands on a phone to actually test the fit on this case or try out the button functions.,1579578045396,0,False
4.0,"Thick & sturdy with a thick, soft ring around the perimeter. A little bulky","This case is for my wife's iPhone XR. It separates into 3 pieces, the back is nearly completely covered, the front is covered around the edges & there is a soft ring that helps hold the main pieces together & provides a shock protection. It looks pretty nice & is very clear so far but it is bulkier than she would typically need since she carries it in her purse but just right for my my daughter who is much more cavalier with her phone transport.<br />There were no instructions included in the package & it took me longer than I want to admit to figure out how to get the case apart. Once the soft outer band is removed the case separates pretty easily & snaps tightly together around the phone.",1578453045257,1,False

The case provides good protection for the phone with a thick clear cover with gold rear accents and a gold outer surrounding piece that covers the outer edges of the phone and proved a good grip on the phone. The gold accents match my iPhone 6s perfectly. My daughter commented on how nice it looked with my phone.,1466622309000,0,True

Temps too hot or cold will greatly shorten the life of the charger.<br /><br />The instructions require a magnifying glass even for folks with 20/20 vision.<br /><br />I don't have a phone that can be charged wirelessly, so I couldn't check that. It requires purchasing another gadget to do that. But everything else checks out fine.",1655314971355,1,False
4.0,Good but not as fast as it claims.,"This product is really good, but it isn't 5X faster like it claims. It is faster, no doubt about it, but it did take 2 hours to charge my phone from completely dead to 75%. Compare that to only a 40% car-charge for the same length of time. However, from 75% to 100% took about 15 minutes. The charge is solid, too. I don't know about how fast it will charge 5 devices or even 2. I only charged one phone The cord is definitely long enough to reach the seats in back of the driver. Not long enough to reach the row in back.<br /><br />The package is not convenient to keep the cord in. You'll need a sock or something to store it in the glove compartment or in the compartment in your door.<br /><br />It works really well.",1502514785829,0,False

I love this case it holds up great to my baby boy constantly throwing my phone on the floor and there have been no scratches or cracks (although phone case does not come with screen protector).  I love the ring and it does not interfere with use of phone when not being used. I highly recommend this case!,1663121116637,0,True
1.0,Very heavy and takes hours to recharge an iPhoneX,"Not sure if mine is defective but it takes many hours to charge my iPhone X.<br />Note in case it’s not clear from the pictures, you can charge one phone wirelessly but the other two phones need to be plugged in with your own charging cables to the two usb outlets.<br />Instructions say to charge and completely use up the battery of the device at LEAST 3 times with the first charge being plugged into the wall and not via solar.<br />However, when this solar charger gets down to the last battery bar, you’ll notice that when you try to wirelessly charge or charge with the USB port, that it will initially start charging, but within a minute, it will shut off. So beware that it’s not like your phone where you can use it till it’s completely empty. The led lights still work at that point though. It’s been really hard to completely discharge the device because when it’s on its last battery bar, it won’t charge my phone. I’ve been waiting for the device to run out of battery on its own but it’s been two days that it still has one bar left.<br /><br />Main problems:<br />1. POTENTIALLY NOT WATERPROOF: Included Instructions say not to get this wet, even though it’s marketed as water proof. The rubber orange flap that covers the USB ports is very flimsy in that I’m not convinced its a very tight waterproofed seal when closed. I am comparing this to my Olympus waterproof camera and Pelican waterproof phone case, which both have very tight seals for any ports.<br />2. WEIGHT: this thing is half the thickness of a brick and weighs about the same as a brick. It’s not something you’d want to take backpacking or in a purse. It’s more of a for-emergency-situations tool. Instructions recommend you utilize it at least every three months.<br />3. DURATION OF RECHARGE: It takes a long time (like overnight) to recharge itself even when plugged into a wall charger.<br />4. EFFICIENCY: It takes at least twice as long to charge my iPhoneX than my other wireless charging pads at home.",1595887714591,22,True
2.0,Issues with noise cancellation and connecting reliably to a PC laptop,"My main issue is that this device does not consistently connect with my PC laptop and then issues arise with switching back to the laptops speaker/mic or using regular headphones. I’ve tried using this twice and both times it caused technical malfunctions that greatly delayed important meetings. I got this headset to cancel out the noise, from my dogs biting on their squeaking toys, when I’m on calls. I tested the noise cancellation feature and found that it can only recognize and cancel out consistent sounds (like a car running or a faucet being on) but does not cancel out random noise in the background. Battery runs out quickly and they also require you to download their app. I’ll be sticking to my AirPods or standard headphones for the future.",1592901070308,1,True

4.0,For iPhone only,"This is a good backup way to carry some spare power in case your phone dies... as long as it is an Apple device, that is. This has only an Apple port, which would be fine except that it also has a USB-C charging port. I was hoping I could use the USB-C to also charge my Android phone with a C-to-C cable, but nope, that port is only for charging the battery up, and it only exports power over the iphone charger port.<br /><br />That's ok, it doesn't claim to be any more than that anyway, but it's worth mentioning. That being said, I wonder why it doesn't also charge using the same iphone cable port? Why have one type of cable for charging and a different for the phone?

5.0,"Great for a prepaid month of service, easy to set up","This kit comes with a sim and 1 month of service pre-paid. I'm not new to Red Pocket so I knew what to expect; I have 2 annual plans (available through their ebay store) that I use as emergency phones when we travel for my kids. I've always been happy with what you get for the money, and I love that you can pick your network of choice (this one being on Tmobile). I always felt like they were a well kept secret!<br />I'm so happy to see they are now selling these big (large bucket of data) plans here on Amazon for a month of service. I was able to activate the line very easily by going to the website, and popped it into a standard unlocked European gsm phone. I did give it my Galaxy S10 EMEI number first when signing up because I didn't have the phone I intended to use on me yet, but the process was so straight forward, it didn't matter, the sim activated and was ready to go. I never even put the sim card in my Galaxy phone, I put it directly into the European phone once I came home and all the internet and phone calls have been working great!<br />The service is identical to T-mobile coverage where I live, I'm told there might be pockets of places where real T-mobile users can roam on other networks to expand coverage (Tmobile often makes roaming agreements with these carriers, and that wouldn't apply here), but so far it has service everywhere that my regular T-mobile line does. It's definitely on par with other MVNOs such as Mint Mobile, both in coverage and data speed.<br />This makes a great month of service to have as a spare line for someone traveling, visiting from another country, or just to try out a switch and see if you like it to save some money. You are given an option to port your number or get a new one, no further payment is required unless you want it to use it for more than the 30 days included.

It holds itself well, and all the ports seem to work so far.

4.0,A very cool and durable feature phone - but for what market?,"I got a chance to try this handset after playing with their higher end M7, so I was sort of expecting a stripped down version of Android like that one has.<br />No such luck, this is a straight-up feature phone (aka ""dumb phone""), with no recognizable OS at all. A throwback to a simpler time, when we didn't have touch screens or apps, or even threaded text messaging! (seriously I forgot how difficult it is to carry a conversation when you can't see the previous messages leading up to it!)<br />It has a camera, but it's also reminiscent of the sort of quality you'd find on camera phones back in the pre-smartphone era. In other words, you can sort of tell what's going on in the photo but it's more of a novelty feature than a useful one. The UI is a little bit clunky and not entirely intuitive either, but you can navigate it well enough once you get used to it.<br />Where this phone shines is in its durability and function. This thing is built like a TANK, waterproof, drop proof, has a great rubber grip in your hands, and that speaker is LOUD. I mean, we're talking using it around factory floor welding machines loud. I love the LED circle on the back that lights up when you play audio, that's actually a really cool feature that normal phones don't have which looks fun and also serves the very real function of being able to find your phone when it rings!<br />The problem, however, is trying to determine who this product is for. They say seniors, but I'd argue it is not well suited for that market. The UI is not polished and feels clunky. My teenaged daughter, however, found the light up speaker really fun and actually wanted to try it out for a week, maybe experiment with decluttering her life from social media apps... but we all know that would be short lived.<br />Honestly, the best use I can think of for this device is someone who works in a rough job, like a factory floor or construction site. You don't want the delicate touch screen and two-handed operation that a common smartphone requires, but you want it loud and durable and life-proof. That's a good option, but then it sort of begs the question of why the ring light on the back? It sort of feels mixed up and unsure of what market to be a part of.<br />For what it is, if the features here speak to you and your needs in a phone, it seems a pretty good option so far!",1663877545913,0,False
3.0,A slightly updated Nuu model,"I'm no stranger to Nuu handsets, I have owned and reviewed others including a Nuu X6 that I left a favorable review for back in 2019/2020. My kid even used it as a daily driver for over a year back then.<br />It was a good value at the time, not great hardware but you got a lot for your money. Back then, low end handsets were still available with 2GB of ram, so for the money you got a pretty decent display paired with 3GB of RAM and Android 9. It also came with 3 months of prepaid Mint Mobile service in the box, which made it an excellent choice as a starter phone with it's own service- perfect for your kids first handset.<br />Here we are 2.5 years later with an updated handset that has... well, an updated version of the Android OS (Android 11 instead of 9) and not much else. It seems like a similar price point for largely similar hardware. We still have 3 GB RAM and 32 GB storage, and a Mediatek CPU that is mediocre at best. I was hoping it would at least be a faster Mediatek chip but if anything it seems somewhat laggier, although that might just be because the system is still optimizing. Either way, not impressed with the performance so far. That was a good value a couple of years ago but the expectations and demands of mobile devices have changed. The display is bigger, I'll give it that, but it is not a higher resolution.<br />Honestly, it feels like the same handset with similar performance at best, but years later and asking the same money. And this time, it doesn't come with the 3 prepaid months so I can't even say it is as good of a value. Apps demand more resources these days, the newer OS is more optimized for devices with more RAM, and these days even cheap phones can be found with 5G. It just feels like a hard sell now.<br />It's not a BAD device, it get the job done as an unlocked basic phone. But the value feels weak, I was expecting something that felt in 2022 like the X6 did in 2019. Underwhelmed.",1663038369657,1,False

5.0,Great way to adapt older USB to C style plugs.,"These are excellent for those of us (ok, ALL OF US) who need to connect older USB type A plugs to newer C-type chargers and devices. The last 2 laptops we bought had only type C ports, and of course there's my phone and now my multi-port charger by my bed for charging my devices which offer only C plugs!<br />Yet so many of my things need USB A plugs. This product helps bridge that gap and allow legacy compatibility while still offering USB3 speeds and functionality.<br />Can't have enough of these, in my opinion. Great product.",1657165963559,0,False
4.0,"Slow charging, but super convinient","Unlike another mag charger we tried, this one actually sticks on with enough force to stay in place if tumbling around in a purse. I like that you can see the ring and make sure it is lined up perfectly with your phone- in our use, my daughter's phone has a case with a ring around it to keep magnetic compatibility, and the other charger we tried didn't show you where the ring was. Unlike this one, you had to move it around until it clicked into place. This one is much easier to use and MUCH stronger! You can not only see the ring protrusion, but it practically sucks itself into the phone case if you even get close. You have to practically peel it off when you want to remove it! Nice.<br />The problem however, is that it seems to take a long time to really fully charge. It's great for backup power or to top off your phone if you're out and about, but if you want to bring your phone all the way up to 100% from dead, you probably want a wall powered charger or at least a USB PD battery bank. This is good in a pinch or when travelling.",1656559208323,0,False
2.0,Charge all the things!,"Update, 11/23/22:<br />After the first trip we took it on, the plug wouldn't stay in the wall and made it difficult to keep our devices charged. It would literally fall out from its own weight.<br />Now, a few months later, I come back and find it stopped working a few minutes into a charge. It's like it is not making good contact in the outlet anymore. Maybe someone else will have better luck, it worked great the first time we tried it, but it only lasted a short while. I even tried bending the pins slightly to get it to make contact. Currently, none of the USB ports are usable and I'm giving up on it.<br /><br />Original review follows:<br />Now that I have a laptop powered by PD, I was excited to need only one charging system for everything when I travel. The problem? My multi-port charging system only supported USB standard, not PD, and higher power items like a laptop require the Power Delivery format.<br />This little adapter is a perfect solution! It is surprisingly small, yet is able to throw enough juice at my laptop to charge it up, while also having other ports available for my phone, headphones, and smartwatch charger.

4.0,Make any phone a magsafe phone!,"My daughter has a Pixel 3 that is perpetually in need of topping up the battery. Rather than getting a large and ugly battery case, I decided I wanted her to be able to use those magsafe chargers that she can carry around attached to her phone when needed, and take it off when not.<br />These rings are great because not only do they fit and stick to the charger, they come in a variety of colors so she could pick which one goes best with her case. And now we have others for use on a different device in the house, etc.<br />The only issue we've found, however, is one time the charger came off with the ring attached. I think the adhesive didn't like her TPU case so much, I might have to go over it with a stronger glue to keep that from happening again. We put one on another case however and it was so strong I had to peel residual residue off the case, so some cases/backs work better than others.",1653061519360,2,False
4.0,Heavy but really useful and works well!,"This is an excellent road warrior companion. It is substantial in size (much thicker than your phone) but I've been able to use it to charge up / top off my phone several times before depleting the battery pack. The wireless charging feature is great, just drop your phone on it and it charges, and it can be used with Android or iPhone devices, anything that is Qi compatible, which is really nice.<br />The solar power bit is kinda gimmicky, though.<br />I mean, yes, I'm sure it is resolving some amount of power through the cells if left in the sun (and you can see the charger LED telling you when it is), but the amount is negligible. I could charge it for days in direct sunlight and not see a noticeable difference in remaining capacity. It feels like a silly selling point that doesn't add any value, and I wonder how much thinner the device could be if they removed it.",1652586882105,1,False
4.0,"Heavy duty, but thick","This is a good way to add mag safe compatible accessories (chargers, wallets, etc) to phones other than Apple's latest iphones. We used it to add magnetic charging capabilities to a Samsung Galaxy S10 and a Pixel 3, which both worked correctly.<br />It actually works better than the metal ring kinds that I've also seen and tried, the magnetic connection is very strong and feels stuck to the phone enough to hold it in place. The problem, however, is that it is THICK. You can't put it inside a case because it is too thick, it needs to adhere to the back of the case or directly on a phone with no case. The reason it is so thick, we found out, is that the inside is not just a ring of metal but actually tiny little magnetic squares arranged in a circle. That means you need to get the polarity of the charger right to stick on, but it also means  your connection will be stronger than the metal only kind. Make sure you measure and determine where exactly the wireless charging receiver is inside your phone or it won't line up and work properly.<br />If you want the strongest connection and don't care that it is a big visible circle on the back, this definitely works.",1652585976545,0,False

It weighs down the phone and it did fall off the first time she tried it (to be fair, she didn't have it lined up correctly, but it was a heavy THUD to the floor). But it does work as a convenient way to charge without cables on the go, and better than a wireless charger that you need to put down and not touch.

4.0,"Really nice and compatible with 22mm watches, inside appears to be silicone","The fit is perfect on my Amazefit GTS3! It was easy to put it on thanks to the quick release notch, and I really REALLY like the contrast between the brown leather looking material and the black watch face. Even the sides look cool because there is a black layer on the bottom of the band. But that's where I get to the one con (if you can consider it one):<br />The inside of this band is still silicone, and kinda similar to the one that comes with most smartwatches. Personally, I wanted a leather band not just for the aesthetics but because I find that sometimes the stock bands irritate my skin when working out. Switching my old watch to a leather band fixed that problem, and I'm hoping this will too, but I'm not sure since the inside might be the same material I started with. That also makes me question if the outside is genuine leather or just a leather-like material to look and feel like it, which is fine for aesthetics honestly. So far I really like it and I intend to keep using it, but if it were solid leather on both sides like other watch bands I've used, I'd give it 5 stars instead of 4.",1652583536221,0,False
4.0,Durable but bulky,"This is a good strong case for the 10 Pro. It's a little thicker than I'm used to, which means some people will really prefer it for keeping their phone protected from falls and dings. It also allows full use of the curved screen on the Oneplus 10p which I was worried would be impeded at the edges. The buttons are clicky and work well, and the cutout for the silent switch is perfectly accessible. However, I do usually prefer smaller thinner cases personally, even if it means a bit less protection. This feels too bulky in my pocket for my own tastes. It is well made, however, so if you are into this style of case, I think you will like it.",1652206886150,0,False
3.0,"I love the size and ergonomics, but T-MOBILE ONLY","This is a throwback to when phones were actually light and pleasant to hold and use as... well, phones. There is NO browser on here, there is not even a camera on here. It is essentially like a cordless landline phone that you can leave the house with, which also supports SMS messages.<br />Calls are clear, volume is good... that is, as long as you have T-mobile service. This phone might as well be locked to that carrier because it won't work with anyone else due to VoLTE restrictions. Verizon *almost* works, I get signal bars and a 4G icon, but since I can't set the APN (there are no APN settings to be found, anywhere) I can't get the LTE to connect, and therefore there is no connection for a voLTE call to be placed. That's OK, the description says it doesn't work with Verizon so that was just wishful thinking, however I have gotten other GSM phones to work and already active VZ sim card, so it SHOULD have been possible, even if unofficially. I put a Red Pocket branded Sim on T-mobile service in for testing, and it worked fine.<br />There are a lot of things I like about it, the size of the buttons, the comfortable feeling in your hand, I love the simplicity and response of it, and the lock button the side means no accidental button presses. BUT, there's a lot I'm disappointed by as well. I own a flip phone from this brand that my son loves (no internet to hog his attention as a communication tool), but at least it has a camera and MMS support. This, surprisingly doesn't even have a camera. It also doesn't support picture messaging (MMS), which surprises me further since that is something that should be expected. Any phone that supports calls and texts should also include MMS as part of the texts layer. If you try to send someone a gif or picture, it just won't show up. No error message, it just doesn't work. Yet the phone has a color screen and can play media like music off an SD card from the menu. This doesn't make sense to me.<br /><br />For the price, it's a cute little phone that does handle calls well. If it had a basic camera, MMS support, and maybe even a simple WAP browser, I'd give this 5 stars easily for the ergonomics alone. But as it is now, I'm kind of disappointed. There isn't a target demographic I can think of for this that wouldn't at least want MMS included.<br /><br />NOTE: If buying this for a senior or child and just want a cheap basic plan, I highly recommend Red Pocket's Annual plan. Make sure you get their GSM-T so it works on T-mobile, I was able to get a plan for $30 for the year as an emergency phone, well worth the investment. But I might recommend their flip phone or a different model that supports MMS instead.",1651723418649,3,False
4.0,Impressing budget phone,"[[VIDEOID:c2219b966be26a8f0df8951bdd80cd4e]] Blu has a reputation of being a decent budget brand and this handset continues that legacy. The first thing you notice is the display- surprisingly bright even in sunlight, and extremely vibrant for the price. Graphics and games are surprisngly fluid and sharp looking, it actually feels reminiscent of Motorola G series handsets. The performance is decent too:<br />Geekbench 5 single core: 342<br />Multi Core: 1200<br />Those test scores aren't current flagship level, but are better than, say, the Pixel 3a series and actually competitive to flagships from not too long ago. Pretty close to a Snapdragon 835 in performance, like a Galaxy S8, yet much more battery friendly.<br />The finger print reader is faster and more responsive than my Galaxy S10, but to be fair the S10 has the worst of the Galaxy fingerprint readers. It even comes with a case and screen protector so you are ready to go right out of the box! But the cameras... that's where the budget nature of this handset starts to show.<br />The camera, despite having a large looking array, really feel low budget. Low light is a non-starter, I won't even bother sharing the noisy garbage that comes out of it. But even in good light, colors are washed out and there's a severe lack of dynamic range that clips highlights and shadows pretty quickly. See photo comparison of a yellow and red box taken next to an open window in my office. The Galaxy S10 and Pixel3A properly captured light from outside the window as well as some detail in the black batteries under the box. It shouldn't be a surprise that those pictures look similar straight out of the camera app, the Pixel and Galaxy S series have some of the best ""standard by which others are judged"" camera performance in the industry. The Blu phone, however, overexposed the window, lost all detail in the battery, and the colors just overall look bad compared to them. I also took a picture trying the ""depth mode"" of a keychain on my wood colored desk, and the bokeh effect is a mess. It doesn't make any sense, blurring out random parts of the wood grain pattern and not looking like real bokeh AT ALL.<br /><br />Basically, this is a decent phone with decent performance and a very nice sized and vivid display for the money! But if cameras are any kind of priority to you, look elsewhere.",1650926862401,1,False
5.0,Great replacement if silicone bands aren't for you,"My son has a Wear OS smartwatch that uses 22mm bands (Fossil Gen 6), and I'm not kidding when I say he is HARD on his watch bands.

I tried getting him a metal one so it wouldn't rip/tear, but he said now it just hurts him or anyone he's playing with when they get hit by a sharp metal edge. This product solves all of those problems. They are soft and have elastic properties that help keep it on and won't rip or tear as easily as the rubber silicone ones. Not only that, but it comes in a multi-pack of many colors so he can switch off to match more formal vs sports wear, and plenty to spare if one does eventually break. I doubt these will break anytime soon, however- they seem much tougher than the ones he's used so far!",1648610382987,0,False
3.0,"Great service, meh activation","The good news is that I've used Visible before and it's actually pretty great service, especially for travel. Most of the US has good coverage with Verizon, which is the network this uses. If you have a VZ compatible device, you should be good to go for a month of unlimited data on the cheap.<br />Where I live, I use T-mobile / Mint mobile and it is great but when I travel I often find a lot of dead spots, especially in the midwest. On a recent trip to Arizona, I was glad to have a Verizon-compatible spare phone with this service on it to ensure I was in contact and could get map data, etc.<br />However, activating the service with this sim was frustrating.<br />First, the system told me my phone was incompatible (A manufacturer-unlocked Samsung Galaxy S10), which is simply not true. I've used this handset with Verizon prepaid services before and it always works perfectly. Oddly enough, a T-mobile locked Pixel 3 was told I could activate, but it wouldn't accept the sim since it was locked to T-mo. Such a backwards system. I had to find a third device I could borrow (a broken screen Nokia 7.1) which it accepted, just to activate it and put it in the original Galaxy S10 which it said was not compatible.<br />I see from the other reviews here that sometimes activation woes are a thing with this system. I don't know why, I've never had trouble with a VZ-mvno before. I'd give the service 5 stars if the setup were easier to manage. I'm guessing phones like Pixels and iPhones won't have any issues, I'm surprised a Galaxy flagship wasn't on their list.",1643841753498,4,False

Its more like a classic throwback to the durable basic phones of yesteryear, but underneath the unsuspecting exterior is the heart of an Android smartphone. Essentially, this is a phone for use in an industrial setting. Like a factory floor, or other noisy/messy/loud environment that would otherwise be somewhat not friendly to smartphones. There is no play store, and the UI is heavily customized to work with the form factor, but some apps can be sideloaded if you know how Android works.<br />This is NOT a smartphone replacement, but rather a durable work phone for those who want to take some of the conveniences of a smartphone without the smartphone.

5.0,Great for my Amazfit GTS 2e,"I love my Amazefit smart watch, but I find myself somewhat sensitive to rubberized silicon on my skin- the included strap used to irritate my wrist if I wore it for too long. Thankfully, this 20mm replacement is a perfect fit!<br />The leather material is much more comfortable on my skin, and attaching it to the watch with the metal pin was actually easier than the oem strap ever was. Buckling it is a little stiffer, but it is still new so I'd give it some time to stretch and act less stiff on my arm. I recently lost some weight and find it comfortable, I think if I had very large wrists I might easily be on the last rung and would find it much less comfortable than I do now. The straps are not very generous if you are large. But for an average sized person, they seem to fit quite well and the dark brown contrast with the black watch face looks super sharp to me, I really like the coloring.<br />All in all, I'm very happy with it so far and would recommend it!",1637113458191,0,False

My kids actually asked me if they could play with putting my phone in over and over, as it really is that much fun to watch the arms spring around into action!<br />The vent mount is kind of genius, I really like the way it secures itself with the screw lock inside. This is so much better than other vent mounts I've seen before. However, I don't like putting my phone in front of the vents during the winter (blasting hot air on my phone), so I used the suction cup mount of my old holster. It turns out the head of this is a standard ball socket with tightening nut and is compatible with most other mounting hardware (dashboard, window suction cup, etc).

5.0,Surprisingly excellent!,"I wasn't expecting much from the pictures, it just looks like a very vanilla TPU case. But in my hands and in person, I really appreciate this case very much. It's actually grippy, like a really rubberized material and feels really good in my hands. It also feels small- even with the case on, it feels like other phones WITHOUT a case  on. That's likely because of how it handles the curved screen- there's no lip because it has to expose the edges.<br />This is a bit of a concern re: durability, but that's the tradeoff to owning a phone with a curved display. The top and bottom of the case DO have a lip, since they are able to over the device edges. That at least offers some durability and protection if face down. Otherwise, all holes/cutouts/etc line up perfectly, it fits like a glove. For the price, I'm super impressed with what is being offered here.",1628568546453,0,False

The base is the standard suction yet sticky material that uses the combination to adhere to smooth surfaces like glass or smooth parts of your dashboard.<br />Here's the problem- you can pretty much only use it in the configuration shown in the picture. In my other car, I have a holder that is attached the glass on the left hand side of my windshield, so the phone is held just over the dashboard and out of my view while I drive.  My dashboard isn't smooth enough to attach directly in this car, but this mounting bracket does not turn backwards the way I want- it's basically an elbow join that just lowers or raises, so  you only realistically get about 45 degrees of possible variation to use it.<br />That means I will have to compromise where it is mounted in that car. However, the holder part is great. Its snaps into place easily, and releases with a button on the back, and the bottom lip can be adjusted as well. I'd give the phone holder 5 stars, but the mounting base only 4.

Disappointed, it barely lasted 3 months.<br />Original review:<br />I got this to use with my wife's Pixel 3a XL, which lacks wireless charging.<br />Happy to say it works, even inside of a wallet case (although I need to pull some of the glue off the back of the wallet case to make it fit- best position seems to be in between the wallet material and the TPU case inside. If placed in the TPU, there are just too many layers and a good connection can't be made reliably). But, I should have opted maybe for a longer cable version. This one places the charging area on the lower third of the phone, which successfully avoids the finger print reader but also makes the phone kind of lopsided on the charger. If placed in the middle of the charging pad, the charging area of this adapter is too off-center to get power. I eventually found a way to make it work for her (I have a long double- space charging pad, and dropping it on there in any orientation seems to make contact), but I needed to fiddle with it before we had a system that works. It is now pretty convenient, and unlike other charging pads I'd try in the past that were cheaper (here and on ebay), this one hasn't burnt out after a few charges.

The icing on the cake is the volt meter which tells me how much power my car's DC port is currently pumping out.

The tripod it comes with is very sketchy, but still decent enough for a desktop. However the phone holder sort of throws off the balance and makes it hard to keep it set up without falling over.<br />I personally was interested in trying this to improve webcam / vblog lighting without my usual 3-point LED light setup. The nice thing about this is that it really is just one light and it gives a very flattering look compared other direct harsh lights or side lights. It's also big enough at 10"" to give a good result for selfies without being too small to cast an even glow or too big that it takes up too much space. The USB port power is fine if using on a desk since there are plenty of USB power ports available by my computer. But if you wanted something more portable, the lack of battery power options and the flimsy tripod which may fall over if used with your phone is definitely something to take into consideration.<br />Otherwise, the results from this are quite nice when used correctly.",1611530658481,0,False

1.0,Did not work with LG V20,"I tried this on my LG V20, as I have wireless Qi chargers for my newer phones (LG G7, etc) and wanted my wife's V20 to also work with them. Unfortunately, I can't recommend this product. At first it was very picky to find the correct charging spot, as plopping it down anywhere close to the middle didn't seem to work as it does on my phones with Qi  built in. But worse, I consistently would come back and find that charging has stopped and never finished. I could lift it up and place it back down and it would start again, but it seems that it would not stay connected long enough to charge my phone fully. Which honestly makes it kind of useless, since I found myself pulling out the tab to charge directly via cable.",1593493985335,0,False
5.0,"Great product, does exactly what I needed","This is a great portable battery bank. I love that it has the ability to charge with either micro-USB or USB-C, so no matter what kind of device you're using you can top off your charge with it's charger. My kids use Micro-USB device, my wife and I have USB C, so it really works out well when someone wants to borrow it.

4.0,Works great! Mixed feelings about LED,"This is one of the smaller Qi pads that I've tried, which is actually something I rather LIKE about it. It is less obtrusive by my bedside than the older model I had there before it, and looks very sleek and professional. Also, since it is by my bed, I would think I would appreciate the fact that the light turns off after a few seconds rather than stay on all night. However, one of my devices had an oddly placed Qi receiver that doesn't always work if not placed perfectly on charging pads, and sometimes will disconnect itself. I'm used to checking on it to make sure it is still charging by glancing at the light to make sure it is still on. Honestly, since the light turns off on this charger, I can't tell if it is charging or not without waking the phone and/or removing it again.  I think I might have to go back to my old charger for this device. For other devices it seems to work fine, but I sort of wish it had the option to auto-shut the LED or just leave it on while charging. I'd give it 5 stars if it had that option.",1583300489634,1,False
3.0,Does NOT come with the LED light,"This is a decent kit that can help take your phone's video recording prowess to the next level. As someone who works in video with pro cameras for a living, I can't stress enough how much of a difference it makes to have lights, a proper mic and a stand for the camera... no one wants to see shaking footage with ambient noise louder than your voice!<br />I was a little bit surprised to see it didn't include the LED light in this kit. It clearly shows one on the box, in the instructions, and even on the listing. But upon further inspection, I now see that THIS kit isn't supposed to include the light, there's another version that includes it- the light in the photos here, after all, is just a drawing! That should have given it away, but it wasn't obvious to me from the listing at first. I think they should be more clear about that so that buyers won't expect it.<br />As far as the product itself- it does work quite well to hold your phone and it can be configured in multiple positions and orientations. The microphones worked alright, I particularly like the lavaliere one, since I found the shotgun style one less clear. The shotgun one did, however, have less echo than the phone's built in mic, so I wouldn't totally discount it. It's good to have. However, you'll need a phone with a 3.5mm TRRS input to use this. I happen to have an LG G7 and a V20 that both offer this jack, but many modern phones have removed it. You may need a dongle or other adapter to be able to use these mics at all. These are things that I really feel aren't made clear before you buy the product, and I think should be. That makes it not a bad product, but one that might let buyers down if they have unrealistic expectations of what they are getting. I hope this review helps people avoid only finding that out when they receive it.",1582667578072,9,False
4.0,"Motorized is cool, but slow","I like the wireless charging part of this the most- I'm not a big fan of fast charging because it heats up the battery in your phone (bad for battery life), and this attached to a standard USB in my car charges at a moderate pace. Not too fast and not too slow either.<br />What I'm not a big fan of, however, is the automatic motorized arms. I mean, at first it seems really cool- they make a satisfying whirrrr noise and grab your phone upon placing it in the Qi zone, and it impresses passengers too because it seems like something a luxury car would do. Pressing the button to release the phone is equally impressive- the first few times. After a while, it gets old and then you sort of wish it had a manual override because it takes too long. Sometimes I'm running into the house for a minute and want to grab the phone while the car is running, and it took me a couple of attempts to get the arms to release and then I'm waiting awkwardly with my hand out for the 2 seconds or so it takes for the arms to finish moving. Two seconds might not sound like a lot, but in that moment it feels like an eternity, and you sort of just wish it had a spring release like the old style phone holders.<br />Also, interesting to note that the motors require power to move. In order to avoid your phone being stuck inside once you turn off the engine, it holds enough internal charge (via capacitor) to release the phone after the power is off, and even enough to grab it a second time, but then it's dead until the car turns the power back on. This normally isn't an issue, except that my kids thought the motorized arms are so cool, so they played with it while the car was off, and then I had to go inside and get my keys to release their phone after they hit the buttons twice without the car on.<br />Also, I occasionally unplug the charger if going on short drives because too many stop/start cycles of charging is supposed to be bad for your phone as well. But then if I don't plug it back in, I can't remove the phone. Again.<br />Kind of silly. Again, its cool and looks impressive (especially at first), and it technically does what it is supposed to do- hold your phone well while driving, and charge it at the same time. So it should get at least 4 stars for fulfilling its duty. However a manual override would be really handy.",1582254553986,0,False
5.0,"Stays cool while charging, helpful LED","I have a quick charging pad that I actually am wary to use for extended amounts of time because my phone definitely heats up from it. Heat is bad for a battery, and since getting into wireless charging, I've been watching my battery temp with an app (accubattery on Android does a good job).  Thankfully, this charging pad seems to really keep the phone relatively cool, definitely more than other Qi chargers, and it is very small and unobtrusive yet doesn't charge too slowly either. If you're going to leave your phone on the charging pad for hours at a time, I definitely recommend this one. I also like the bright LED that tells me the phone is connected and stays on so at a glance I can see if my phone isn't making good contact anymore or anything like that. I had another Qi charger that initially lit up to say it connected, but then the LED would turn off leaving me to find out hours later that it actually disconnected because it was at a bad angle at only 50%.  Not the case with this one. It's a good deal for a very decent simple wireless charger, and I would recommend it over fancy QC ones!",1582224498744,0,False
4.0,A great value - especially the 3 months of service included!,"[[VIDEOID:eeae8b3e312505bd3125b4d433c85dbb]] Make no mistake- this is NOT a great phone. It's a great value for the money, but it will never compete with, and should never be compared to, anything remotely flagship. It's a passable Android device, a worthy backup and an excellent first phone for someone.<br />If you remember the Amazon exclusive Blu R1, it's that caliber of device- surprisingly useful for not a lot of money. But upgraded, as we now have 3GB of RAM and 32 GB storage standard. In this day of $1000 smartphones, its great to see some entry-level products that aren't terrible. What makes this even more incredible, however, is the included 3 months of service. There's an included SIM card for Mint Mobile, a T-mobile MVNO, which you can activate in the phone and use for the next 3 months for FREE. Assuming T-mobile has coverage where you live (they've gotten a LOT better lately!), and 5GB LTE is enough per month for your needs, you now have the next 3 months covered. I'm personally paying $20 a month for my plan, so that means this handset could save me $60 of service.  That makes this already decent value handset into an incredibly good value!<br />For more details about the phone and performance, camera, benchmarks, etc, I decided to include a video rather than many paragraphs of text. Hope it is helpful!",1581890671145,1,False
5.0,A great choice for travellers or kids room,"My wife is travelling for work and took this along to charge her smartwatch and phone in the hotel room. Not only does it offer dual USB ports with sufficient power to charge both at the same time, but the LED light is a welcome bonus feature.  If you've ever tried to plug in a device in the dark, you can appreciate why the light is a killer feature. At home, my kids love this because they can adjust the light's colors using the buttons on the side of the unit. It's a great product.",1579560020385,0,False
5.0,LOVE THIS! A headset designed for FUNCTION rather than form!,"This has got to be my favorite headset for actual PHONE calls and listening to lectures. I have plenty of dual-ear headphones, both over the ear style and Air-pod style, but they all have microphones up by my ears and away from my mouth. That setup works alright but in noisier environments (working around tools, washing dishes, etc) callers almost always tell me they hear too much background noise and it is hard to hear me over it.<br />But NOT WITH THIS ONE! This headset is designed for functionality over style, and gives a very good mic up close to your mouth, you know, where words actually come out! Callers were able to hear me in places I normally wouldn't bother trying to hold a conversation, and the ear piece meanwhile is fantastic! No more trying to pop ear buds back in with my fingers when they are dirty or wet, the over-the-head band design makes it comfortable to wear and keeps it in place, and while the single-ear sound isn't ideal for music, it is GREAT for audiobooks and lectures. When I'm not on the phone, I like to listen to lectures and books while busy and working with my hands. Usually this means that I have to stop and take off half my dual-ear earphones if someone needs my attention (happens often), which is annoying not to mention I often can't hear someone calling my name when I have the noise cancellation style one. For a while I was actually listening to something with over-the-ear style headphones and one side OFF my ear so that I could hear and answer people at the same time as listen to the author. This, obviously, takes care of all those issues while also being the best phone call experience I've had on a bluetooth headset.<br />The charging base is cool too, it holds the headset up and ready to go but I sort of wish that it would turn on automatically when you remove it from the base, and then turn off when you put it back on. That way it would waiting and ready and require a single motion to use it (take it off the base and put it on). Right now I have to remember to turn it off when I'm done like any other headset or else it will continue getting my calls and phone audio when waiting on the base as long as I'm in range. And when I put it on, obviously I need to manually press the power button again as well. Feels like this would be a simple thing for them to fix, but alas, I find this set so great otherwise that I'll let that slide.",1569351471218,3,False
5.0,This is the BEST way to hold your phone in landscape,"Two very important and often overlooked things that are great about this: Landscape, and Wallet-case compatibility. Let me start with the former: Ever notice that car info systems like GPS screens are ALWAYS widescreen / landscape orientation? That's most likely for the same reason TV and computer screens are... your eyes are side-to-side, not up and down. So the most efficient layout of information to be seen at-a-glance is side to side. Yet, most car phone holders are designed to hold your phone in that awkward looking up-and-down vertical portrait orientation. It not only looks silly to me, it also never fits the aesthetics of your dashboard and seems out of place.<br />This is one of the ONLY phone holders that actually makes your phone look like it is part of the dashboard display. It's not oddly sticking out of your window or blocking a vent or anything like this. In fact, if you stick this mount in the center of your console, it looks like your phone is just an additional screen above your other components, like it BELONGS there, like a factory installed option.<br />Using it for GPS and streaming radio looks like I have one of those fancy Android Auto head units built in (even though my car predates that tech!), the only tell being when I decide to also charge it via cable on the side.<br />But the other great thing about this, is that my wife can use her wallet case on her phone and still mount it in this holder. That's something we've been struggling with doing on almost every other phone holster out there.  We love this so much on our minivan that I decided to replace my magnetic phone mount on my commuter car as well. I highly recommend this style holder to anyone who wants their phone display to be cleanly visible and efficient while not an eye sore.",1567387190738,0,True
5.0,A great fit for a great phone,"Let's face it- the V20 is not a small phone. For my wife, once you are carrying around something this big, it might as well also be a wallet/clutch. This case is great in that it holds a credit card and license and her phone conveniently so all her bases are covered.  The stylus pen is a nice add on, but not really so practical- we don't carry it around or use it. On a screen this big, you don't really need a stylus to pinpoint fine details on the display with your touch. It is nice that they throw it in, but the case is obviously what you buy this for.<br />Something to note: LG phones DO support magnetic auto-sleep and wake functions. But, very few cases are made to work with that. More specifically, some cases have a magnet in the fold on front that the phone can detect and automatically put it to sleep when closed. It will then auto wake when you open the flap (you can actually try this waving a fridge magnet over your screen if you want to see). This case does NOT do that, as none of the inexpensive cases seem to.<br />However, with the V20, you have the ""second screen"" which WILL sleep upon the proximity sensor detecting the flap is closed, and wake up when it sees the light again. So that's a nice touch, but all cases will do that. Meanwhile, you still need to manually wake the phone in this case by either double-tapping or pressing the power button / FP reader. This is something I was trying to find out about before hand but no one was mentioning, so hopefully this information helps the next person!",1565640476963,0,True
5.0,Quality,"We have a 6x that we use as a backup phone. On a recent trip, I wanted to have our kids carry it but also wanted to protect it. I'm a fan of wallet cases since they cover the sides and front of the phone to protect it from scratches and dings. The quality of this case is good, the embossed pattern is cool looking and overall I'm impressed with it.<br />There are only two card slots inside and a cash sleeve, so it isn't as big as some other wallet cases, but personally I wasn't looking for one with so many pockets anyway.",1563816513957,0,True

3.0,Great for standard phones in cases. Not so great for flip cases.,"This was recommended to me because my wife uses a flip (wallet) case with her phone, so standard magnetic or holster mounts don't grab it well. Her phone fits nicely sideways so the idea behind this seems to make sense for users like her, but the angle is just barely too acute to fit the wallet part flipped behind the phone. Its a shame, as it almost works, but the case can still sort of drop the phone during a turn, which is unfortunate. On my phone it worked fine since I just use a standard TPU shell to protect my phone, but I don't need this for my car. I wanted it for my wife's wallet case. It didn't do what we wanted, but the seller was very pleasant to deal with and understanding- they did try to figure out a way to solve our problem, but ultimately it didn't work for us. If you don't use a flip case, its great.",1529634834305,1,True
4.0,Nearly perfect!,"This case is excellent at what it needs to be- namely, protect the phone, look nice, all while also conveniently being a mini-wallet. The buttons are still easy to use (plastic is not too stiff, unlike other wallet phone cases I've used), and the cutouts for the camera and speaker keep it from getting in the way of normal operation.<br />The only issue I've had, is the clearance for the headphone jack on the bottom. When we tried to use the AUX input in our car, my wife couldn't get the plug to go in completely because a bit of the plastic shielding around the phone got in the way. After pulling away at it with a fingernail, I managed to get enough clearance for the plug to go the rest of the way in and work properly, but it seems we have to do this every now when using the jack. I thought about using a pocket knife to make the hole bigger in case it happens again, but I'm afraid of going too far and ripping the plastic, which would then cause the phone not to stay in place any longer.<br />Thankfully, my wife doesn't use wired headphones very often so this hasn't gotten in the way of her thoroughly enjoying the case otherwise. I just think it could have been made better to avoid that problem.<br /><br />Another thing that would have been nice (but not expected), is a magnet for auto-wake. The X Power actually has an auto-sleep/wake feature which uses a magnet on their official flip cover! I had read about this &#34;window view&#34; mode which gets enabled with their official LG cases, where there is a stripe of visible vertical screen that shows alerts, time, etc, when the cover is closed (and it eventually times out to sleep). When the cover opens, it wakes up the phone.<br />I tested this with a refrigerator magnet, and sure enough it works! I tried sticking a thin magnet into the wallet section of the case to emulate this functionality, but it wasn't strong enough. I might try using some adhesive with a stronger magnet in the future. Would be super cool if the third party cases had this magnet!",1485230406000,0,True

4.0,"Very thin case, great for keeping phone size down!","This is a great thin case if you want to keep a low profile and still protect your phone from scratches. I had a bigger and more durable rubber+plastic hard case on my Moto E before, but it made the phone feel humongous. Part of the appeal of the Moto E (at least to me) is that it is a smaller handset at 4.5 inches, so I wanted a case that didn't add a whole lot of extra width to it. This is great! And I actually kind of dig the clear look on it, as the Moto is a nice looking phone IMO.<br />The only issue is that my wife, who I bought this for, actually likes the bigger and tougher case because she drops her phone alot and feels more confident with the hard case than this one. Oh well, I might get one of these in my phone's size next!",1475698852000,0,False
4.0,An honest review!,"So first of all, I originally had pictures to go with this, but Amazon's review system has been having trouble approving reviews with pictures lately. I'm re-writing this review without pictures this time in order to make sure it doesn't get stuck in limbo again. So y'all will have to use your imagination a little more!<br /><br />This is a pretty great case for a Galaxy S4. As you can see in the product description and photos, it has two parts: a smaller half-shell case for the actual phone, and a larger belt holster that it securely slides into. When the phone is inserted into the holster, it is fairly well protected on all sides. The holster is actually REVERSIBLE as well, which means you can insert your phone facing outwards or inwards. What is interesting about this setup, is that you can actually use the rotating belt clip part as a kickstand using this nifty metal clip in the middle of it to hold it up (wish I could show the picture for this). But to be perfectly honest, there's very little reason I can think of to do this since the smaller inner case has its own kickstand already, and using it facing outward in the holster doesn't actually offer any additional protection. It just does the same think but bulkier!<br /><br />Speaking of which, one that I didn't like about this case is that without the whole thing slid into the holster, there really is only protection on the back and part of the sides of your phone. A lot of the edges are open and unprotected, especailly the top and bottom edges, which is unfortunately the part that is prone to knicks/dents if it falls. That being said, the small inner case might not offer as much protection as a silicone wrap style one, but it does at least make the phone less slippery to hold in your hand since it is a rubberized plastic shell. I actually like that, since you not only get to have a kickstand, you also get the non-slip and scratch deterrent of rubber/silicone, while also have the dent protection of hard plastic. Oh yeah, and the kickstand works in both portrait and landscape orientations.<br /><br />Things I didn't like:<br />-I've already mentioned that without the holster, it feels like the front and edges of my phone aren't really protected. If you want something like an Otter Box, look elsewhere (this is way thinner though).<br />-The inner case is a bit difficult to remove quickly for battery swaps. I actually have 3 spare batteries I like to keep on tap so I never have to charge, and I always feel like I have to bend the shell to almost the point it might break to get the phone out. I'm not sure if it is designed to withstand doing that on a regular basis.<br />-When using the phone in the holster, it effectively blocks access to the USB port for charging. You can't keep the holster on it while charging.<br /><br />That's the worst I can think of. Everything else is pretty great about it. I love the kickstand and the rubberized hard plastic. To be fair, I did receive this at a discount in return for my review. I do my best to be completely honest about the things I review, and for the retail price, I think it deserves 4 stars.",1470251035000,0,False

It gets it’s power from USB, so you will either need a portable power bank or just plug into USB outlet.

It seems to hold my phone better without the case... it fits, but fell off a few times with the case on. The camera holder is nice. I just wish the arms were a bit more sturdy as if you have a heavier phone or camera, the arms sink down as they can’t bear the weight. This actually happened with both my Samsung phone and camera... 😩<br /><br />I like the flexibility of this product as you can position however you want, and the light has different settings. The flexibility also allows for easy storage.<br /><br />I think it would be better if the bottom had a stand, versus a clamp. The clamp is difficult to open and if the surface is too thick or thin, it won’t stay. This doesn’t leave me with many areas to clamp it on...

3.0,"Great looking, but of dubious quality","I'll review this in two parts, the looks and the functionality.  The case looks great, and the pinstripe fabric is truly a unique look for the iPhone.  With that said it's quite bulky and adds considerable heft to my iPhone, although since it's such a slim phone to begin with it really doesn't bother me overall.<br /><br />As for the build quality, I had my first drop in the house after having the case for a day.  The two halves attach together in 3 places, on the sides and at the top.  The top clip is very small piece of plastic, maybe 2mm wide, although there is room for a much wider clip.  This immediately shattered when I dropped the phone, and the case exploded, leaving my iPhone and the two halves of the case on the ground.  I'm worried what will happen if I drop it on a more dangerous surface outside.  Now the case doesn't fit as securely because it's only attached on the sides, and I can't see how in testing they couldn't determine that piece would snap off really easily.  I think the attachment between the two halves should be a lot more secure so it just doesn't come apart when dropped ... I mean, isn't the point that it protects the phone when it's dropped?<br /><br />Good effort speck, but if I didn't love the way this looked so much I'd have a new case on there already.",1248761230000,0,True
4.0,"Mostly great, with a few flaws","I've had this installed in my car for about 2 months now and overall am very pleased with it.  I wanted a bluetooth kit that would not only let me make calls but also let me play music from my phone without having to plug it in and this accomplishes that quite well.  Overall I'd say it's a great product with a few flaws that annoy me on an almost daily basis, but that I've pretty much gotten over (though I can't make sense of some of these design decisions - hasn't Parrot been making these for a while?)<br /><br />1. The screensaver - there's a screensaver that comes on for seemingly no reason other than to distract you while you're trying to look at the road. It's just a bouncing bluetooth logo that you have to press a button on the remote to get rid of, usually resulting in the system performing some unintended action when all you wanted to do was make the screensaver go away so you could see your signal strength and/or battery life.<br /><br />2. Audio muting - it seems a little aggressive on the audio muting.  For some reason it seems to insist upon muting your system for about 3 seconds when it connects to your phone and also any time you get a text message, even though...<br /><br />3. No text display - it doesn't display texts on the screen.  You just have to infer that you got one by the fact that it muted the audio for a few seconds and then pick up your phone and check it.  Lame.  I swear other bluetooth kits can do this...<br /><br />4. No track info display - this one is certainly more annnoying that I thought.  Again, you have to pick up your phone to see what track is playing (although thankfully you can control playback from the remote).<br /><br />5. Doesn't work well with polarized sunglasses - (starting to dig here) If you've seen a display that gets all screwy when you're wearing polarized sunglasses, then you know what I mean.  I'm just mentioning this because a lot of people wear them while driving and Parrot designs a lot of car kits, so you think they would have designed with this in mind.  Or not...<br /><br />6. The remote - while I haven't had any of the breakage or short battery life issues that other people have, I am surprised at how poor the remote mounting ""system"" is - and by system I mean a cheap plastic band that is way too huge for just about any steering wheel.  I mounted mine on the thickest part of my wheel and had to use the tightest setting on the mounting band.  I know Sony has been making wheel-mounted remotes for its car stereos for years that have much better attachment systems than this.  Come on Parrot!<br /><br />Overall, I'd say if you're considering, it's either this or the Bluetouch at like 2-3x the price.  Overall a great system, so much so that I've been considering getting an iPhone if and only if they add stereo bluetooth because I'd miss being able to use my MK6100 too much if I switched.",1225961472000,1,False

2.0,Meh,"Despite what others have said, I am NOT loving this more than my pop socket. I've been trying to adjust for the last three weeks. I think it comes down to how you naturally hold your phone while using it.  I gave small hands, and what I have since realized is that I don't hang onto my phone with my fingers or an actual grip. Rather i hang onto the popsocket between my two fingers, my grip is ""open"" the phone rests on my fingers, leaving my thumb free to move anywhere.  With this ring, I've been forced to go back to gripping the actual phone and now my mobility is limited.  I'm also finding I have to use two hands far more often with a ring grip (to type and surf.... as well as to open, close and spin the ring). I'm constantly having to adjust the ring to fit my grip, since I rotate my phone screen a lot.<br />I also don't get or understand the generic clear adhesive circle disk that you have to put down before attaching the 3m adhesive. It's huge under the ring, it's ugly, and is already starting to bubble up on the edges. And technically, the 3m adhesive isn't touching the case at all. Pretty sure the 3m was included simply as a selling point.<br />Don't get me wrong, pop sockets aren't perfect. Of the three I've had, the design rubbed off on all three and one popsocket broke off.  But never had a problem with the actual adhesive despite common complaints with them.  And I find it easier to use, since I don't have to consciously think about what position the ring is turned too.<br />The other thing I noticed is the metal ring is hard... The popsocket is more of a tough rubber. I kind of smirked at other reviews that complained about the hard metal not being a comfortable feeling.... But they were surprising correct.  Our fingers are very sensitive and the hard metal ring is uncomfortable in comparison.<br />The only aspect of the ring I like over the popsocket is when I'm actually NOT using the phone.  Carrying a ring looped onto one finger is more secure than a pop socket squeezed between two fingers.  I'm switching back to a pop.",1574564809114,2,True

I highly recommend to make sure those four screws are tight.<br />So in a month of wearing the band, one of the screws got loose, eventually unscrewed and i lost it, the band fell apart.<br />I emailed to their customer service, they replied immediately apologizing for this unfortunate event.

The good news is that if you're persistent enough you'll figure out how to take it apart to fix (it was a little tricky, but not too bad).

1.0,Not a good fit for most phone cases.,"It's hit or miss with them and it all depends on the type of case that you're using. These full-screen tempered glass cases are not compatible with 90% of the cases out there. I bought my 2nd iloome screen protector (white) for my iPhone 6 because my last case (elago S6 Duro Case) ruined the first screen protector b/c the fit was too tight. So I bought the Apple leather iPhone case, thinking that the low profile and slim fit would be compatible with the iloome. Well, I was wrong... it did not fit towards the bottom and the more I used the phone, the more the screen protector started coming up from the screen of the phone. Over the weekend, I ran a 5-mile road race with the phone in my pocket and even though the phone was protected from the rain, the cover peeled up and got condensation in the phone and ruined my screen.<br /><br />Overall, these screen protectors are good, but just be careful with the case that you're using with it.

1.0,The case itself is great and just your typical Spigen Tough Armor case,"Save your money and get the Tough Armor and not the Tough Armor FX. Not worth it. The front screen cover is just a cheap plastic and because it's so loose, you end up having to buy another screen protector of higher quality so you can actually see your screen. The cheap plastic has a matte finish so when you're outside in the sun, you can barely see your phone. Screen quality is awful with this case. The case itself is great and just your typical Spigen Tough Armor case, so it's best to just save the $5 and get the basic Tough Armor -- not FX version.<br /><br />The flimsy plastic cover is not flushed against the screen, so when you type, the screen isn't always very responsive and you hear a clicking noise of the plastic hitting against the iPhone's screen. Again, the case itself is durable and fits the phone well, but the marketing of a &#34;front cover&#34; with flimsy, low quality plastic really cheapens the overall product.<br /><br />Suggestion is for Spigen to re-market this product with tempered glass cover instead of low quality plastic.",1430408079000,1,True

It has held up well for a week, but that’s not saying much. Packaging was nice. I’ve given it 4 stars because one is the reasons I paid more for this case was that it included a glass screen protector. Unfortunately, the screen protector is not good. First of all, it covers the front camera, making selfies look ridiculous. Also, as another person mentioned, it pulls off of the sides. There is also a lanyard that attaches to the phone. This looked neat online, but is odd and impractical in person.

First time my phone did fall from my pocket and hit the ground... not hard but enough to share the protector (not my phone, thankfully). The second time, it was just in my pocket... no idea how it got ""hit"" but it was shattered enough it was hurting my finger to get near it. On the plus side, my phone is fine, so they did their job. But at 1 a month, they are gonna get pricy. I'll be trying a few other brands and see if it's just glass or this brand in specific that seems really shatter-prone. They were also a bit fiesty to put on and I've not gotten them as lined up as I'd like over the front camera... close but no cigar. The back camera protector is going strong and I've got the two extra, so half a point for that small grace.

When I got my new phone, I had no hesitation in buying Cimo again.  The only reason it gets 4 and not 5 is that the camera on the S6 is raised more, and the case just barely is the same height, so there is very little protection on the camera.

I suspect the cheap see-through plastic hardened and warped.<br />I ended up ripping the case off and tried to contact Lifeproof support.

4.0,Good so far,"Car: 2009 scion xb with textured sloping dash<br />Phone: galaxy s21 in a slim Otterbox case<br /><br />My car has some design flaws when trying to mount something like this. First, my car has no level and untextured surface in the dash area that does not block something important like the odometer. Ive tried suction cup things and because of the texture or the curves, the suction would not stay. The front window is too far from the driver seat to make mounting anything to it very useful. Second, the vents are created in a way that phone holding devices can attach to them. So I've been searching and trying for 12'ish years to find something to hold my phone, preferably in my line of site, but at this point I'll take anything because im tired of fishing it out of the area between the passenger seat and door after I've made too sharp off a turn and its slid off the seat.<br /><br />This item so far has worked out great. The adhesion to the dash is holding fast. My phone fits it snuggly. The price was good. I'm happy with it.<br /><br />My future concerns: haven't had it over the summer yet and your dash, especially a black dash, can get pretty toasty. I'm afraid the adhesion will fail. I also would like the ability to move it. I'm afraid if I peel it off the stickiness will break down. I guess time will tell. At this price point I would not mind if I have to replace it every year or so.",1639498613139,1,True
2.0,Taking back my this is great,Ive had many of these over the ywats for different phones and this one just turned out to be a headache. The volume buttons never worked right so i had to take the phone out of the case to take a screen shot or of I was trying to turn the volume up or down it would take it full blast or must it. So annoying and not cheap. Not even a year old and i have to find a different one. Probably not otter box.<br /><br />Old: I have the exact same otter box commuter for my older galaxy so when I got the s21 I bought one for it. There are cheaper options out there but otter box has never let me down. It adds some bulk to the phone so it's not so slippery while not adding so much that you can't fit it in your pocket or whatnot. Thankfully over never drastically dropped either phone while in this case. The few times I have dropped or banged the phone it has come through just fine. I recommend. Pay a bit more and get your money's worth.,1633883668405,1,True

If the device doesn't work for you double check that.<br /><br />The charging is fast and something I really like since i keep it beside my bed is it doesn't have any extra lights. When you first put the phone on a green light appears on the bottom of the base but it goes off after a few seconds. When it's done charging it stays black.

The side functions are easy to use. It is easy to grasp.<br />I've had other Otterbox cases over the years from different series and this one appears to protect as well as the bulkier cases. I haven't dropped it yet so can't be 💯 sure on that point.<br />By mistake with my last phone, it was left behind on a table when we went out. I came back to the phone having been mauled by my dog. He chewed the case corners really well, cracked the glass on the front and back. Thankfully he was not able to chew thru the case and actually eat/swallow any glass.

It definitely makes the phone bulkier compared to my husband's Apple iPhone case for the same model but not bad compared to other Otterbox cases or other brands I have seen. Since I carry mine around with me in my pocket I really like the extra protection. I have dropped it a couple of times.....thus the need for protection.....and this case has protected my phone. I don't have any intentions to get it wet but sometimes things happen. I have not been able to use the top button on the left side that slides to turn the phone to silent but it is easy enough to go to settings and switch to airplane mode that that doesn't bother me. My fingerprint id works probably 80% of the time with this case.,1410274139000,0,True

Also I love the watch hook up too, the cord charger it comes with is kind of a pain, it never really stayed in one place and easily got disconnected.

My husband and I each put one of the magnet under our case and it does the trick perfectly. The only complaint is that the smaller circle magnet, you kind of need to make sure you hit the magnet right on, or it will fall off. The magnet does have a sticky on it though so you could easily solve that problem if you used the sticky option. The square magnet is a lot bigger and it works great in my case, I don’t really need to make sure the magnets hit right on.",1559507836016,1,False

4.0,Would be much more useful if the buttons were more open to programmability.,"I bought the Tablet Pro Pen Tool from the MS Store, which adds a few options, though none that are useful to me. The net result is that I don't use the pen.<br /><br />I bought the stock Microsoft type cover and I was going to buy the MS pen, too. Because there were multiple options for each I did a little research and discovered that while all the aftermarket keyboards have serious drawbacks, most people seem to like this pen better than the MS pen. And it does have very nice feel for drawing and inking.<br /><br />My expectation for a pen comes from Wacom products, which are much more open in what you can assign. I was amazed that you can't even assign your own keystrokes - even with the aftermarket app. And really I expect keystrokes, macros, and system functions at minimum.<br /><br />Is this pen good compared with the MS pen: it seems that it is. Is this pen good compared to what I expected: it's literally useless for me apart from photography.<br /><br />I wanted to use this for annotating PDFs as I read.

5.0,"I take my phone out this case often, so I assume mine will wear out faster...","So far so good. Last night I dropped my phone out of my pocket while riding across the entire Kansas City metro on my bicycle. It was only after I met my wife and used her phone to locate mine that I was able to locate it on an out-of-the-way shortcut I take close to a limestone quarry.<br /><br />I use this case as a safeguard against rain and sweat while riding my bicycle. Otherwise the phone is in a minimal case that's not very protective.<br /><br />I suppose the proof of a good case is forgetting that you use it. This case is pretty good in that regard. The plastic screen feels different from glass - can't think of much beyond that to criticize.<br /><br />The case survived its only test to date, which was probably nothing more that being dropped from about 1.5m off the ground at moderate speed onto hard, uneven suface.<br /><br />The thumbprint reader works fine with this case. In my experience with this type of case, the weak points are as follows. The thumbprint reader will gradually become loose and opaque. This might be because I'm always removing the phone. The other flaw is the flimsiness of the silence button actuator. There is a little clip that holds the circular actuator against the frame of the case, and those are generally too brittle/weak for the job. This might be another result from removing the phone often. I know that the actuator sometimes becomes misaligned when I'm putting the phone into the case. IDK<br /><br />BTW I ended up with this case because the Lifeproof case I originally bought didn't fit the iPhone SE 2. It is close enough that you can fit the phone into the case and kinda make it work, but all the buttons are misaligned. With this case everything fits perfectly. And the price is less than 1/3 the price of the Lifeproof case.",1616930754795,10,True

The material is just hard plastic - IDK what I expected but i would never describe it as rubberized - but I'm not taking off stars for that because I might just be ignorant of that usage.<br /><br />It seemed like a good deal because of the price, but usually I don't use it because the look and feel is just too awful for my taste. I think I want to find a plain silicone type material cover for this phone.<br /><br />BTW I love the LG Optimus phone.

5.0,Just got free accessory for my ring light!,"I got this ring light in July 2020 and this week, in October 2020, I just got a package saying the company just received a new accessoary for their ring light customers and they didn't want to leave me out. The accessoary is the attachment that allows you to place your mobile phone in the middle of the light. There was always a connection point there, but I originally did not get that attachment. I don't remember if it was in the photograph of what ships wiht the ring light when I originally bought it in July. I assume not. It is in the photo of what you get when you order this now. It works much better than the phone attachment that attaches to the stand below the light because it is flexible and easy to reposition once the phone is already attached to it.<br /><br />The wonderful thing is that without charging me anything more, the company decided this should be with the package I bought several months ago and without any request from me, they shipped it to me.<br /><br />The whole light set up works really well. My favorite things are: (1)  It has 3 settings for the light tone. (2) The tripod is super configurable so I can sit it on my desk or stand it on the floor and it works equally well both ways. (3)  The remote control works GREAT! It allows me to take a photo with my iPhone and also will start recording a video with the iPhone.",1603115999556,0,True

First tryout was a Christmas Fair - had it with a group of cousins, and we were able to keep track of exactly where they were, and meet up with them.  This can be used in so many ways - it was good for the kids to see how it worked in a good way.

3.0,Not the right location for me...,"Since I live in southern CA, and we are still using the A/C, I’m not crazy about plugging this into an air vent.  It probably has to do with where your air vents are located, and if one of them provides a good view of your phone.  My air vent put the phone slightly behind the steering wheel, which wasn’t working for me.

I have a black Kate Spade purse, and my IPhone, in it's original black case, was nearly impossible to find quickly in that interior.  I missed so many phone calls just trying to find the darn phone!  Now, encased in shiny gold, it stands out like a beacon, and there will be no more scrambling searches!  Yes, I could have found something in a bright color that would have done the trick, but, why do that when I can pamper myself with some Kate Spade bling!  I love this case - fits great, looks great!

It fits my Samsung S20+ nicely and it is easy to use and put the phone in. The ""head"" is very flexible and you can place it where you want, rotate it in any direction really.<br /><br />The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because the clamp could be a bit wider in the opening.",1678808252567,0,False
5.0,Surprisingly small and powerful,I was surprised how small these were yet how powerful they are. they work as promised and hold the phones in place as they should.

They are great spare batteries to have for your phone or tablet (anything with an USB-C charging port) and work so well. They charge quite fast and are nice to have for someone like myself who uses their gadgets a lot. This one is great looking and indicates the power it contains by indicator lights. I wish it actually had the percentage like my other one has but it is not a big deal to be honest. Great battery to have since they are just so small and convenient and easy to use.",1678640030151,0,False
5.0,Very nice car phone holder,"This is a great car phone holder that works well for my Camaro. In this car the vent holders just don't work as well because there is not as much space so I was looking for something that would work better and I came across this one. It really solved my problems. I mounted the suction holder on the dashboard and now i can angle the phone in whatever direction I want so I can see the phone when I need to. This works really well for me, so much better than the vent holders where I could only do landscape but never portrait format.<br /><br />It opens and closes easily and automatically but also has a button to do so. It charges very fast. This is a great mount that can also be attached to the windshield if I want to but for now I am keeping it on the dashboard. Great find.",1678636632382,0,False

The holder itself actually contains a battery that can be charged but you have to plug the phone into it to charge it but don't have to connect it to the car at this point which is nice.<br /><br />It has a very fast charging overall which I like if you need a fast boost. The design of it is super cute and even the lights on it light up at night, something different if you ask me and different is always what I look for. The clamps work automatically regardless on if it is connected to the car or not with the internal battery.<br /><br />It mounts nicely onto the vent but unlike a lot of vent clamps it can rotate around in many directions to fit your needs. This is a great little charger and I for one am a fan.",1678634956219,0,False
3.0,Sadly does not work for Samsung phone,"I was hoping this would work for the Samsung phone but it does not.<br /><br />It is a nicely made wallet that has a decent amount of space for cards. it is very nicely made and when unfolded really makes a nice stand for your phone. It has a sold hinge in there that really is sturdy. I don't think you can fit as many cards in there as I would hope to, maybe a couple on the inside and a few on the outside (wouldn't be enough for me). Overall pretty nice but can't speak for the magnet. It did not work with the Samsung that it magnetic but did not hold onto that well but will probably hold onto the Iphones better.",1676473865953,0,False
5.0,Have been wanting one for some time,"This is what I have been wanting for some time now. It is small, compact and powerful. It is however heavy but I don't mind. I have a Samsung S20 plus and I get a full charge for the phone out of this one which is great. You don't need a cable for it to charge it, just plug it into the phone and go.<br /><br />You can charge it with a lighting cable or a USB-C cable which is what it comes with. It is super easy to use and if you so choose you can charge it and the phone at the same time, which does slow it down a little bit but that I usually do overnight so not a bit deal. Overall really happy with this and glad to have this around. Very convenient on especially trips but for me great to have since I tend to beat up my phone using it for music and videos which tends to drain it even with its great battery power. Everyone should really have one of these around and keep it with them for those just in case moments since you don't need a cable and can really charge anything with it that has a USB-C port, like your tablet or a speaker with the same port.",1673964584446,0,False
3.0,Can't flip yor phone and doesn't last that long,"This phone holder works. It is not bad but not the best in my eyes. I like that you can hold your phone nicely with 2 fingers. I also like that you can use it as a phone stand which is great, so you get 2 different uses out of this one.<br /><br />The one down side of this is that you can only hold your phone one way. If you want to flip it you can't use the holder because of the way these are made, which sucks to be honest. You get 3 of these for under $10 but it doesn't solve the rotating issue.",1630076333599,1,False

The ring can rotate all the wary around with ease so no complaints there.<br /><br />I have to say though it is not the most comfortable way to hold the phone. In the past I used a strap instead and am much more used to that. But my current phone case doesn’t have that so I was thinking of a way to make it easier to hold and came across this. I am not too happy on how easy it is to hold the phone that way but that is more a personal preference really. It is a universal holder that will work on any phone on any surface really.",1602953125207,0,False

The quality seemed right and everything so all looked good in my eyes.<br /><br />But then the big one, it just didn’t fit right at all. I think the one I got is just a bit warped and if one side fits in right, the other side would come out. It’s like off by just a mm or so, very annoying. And for that I have to give it a fail.",1602952846374,0,False
5.0,Very happy with this phone car charger,"I really like this wireless car charger a lot. I got this particular one because I really liked the sleak design of it. It is very easy to assemble and use. It attaches to the air vents in the car which makes the phone readily accessible when you use it for navigation or music or whatever.<br /><br />In the front is a sensor that when you wave in front of it the clamps open up. You then put the phone into it and the clamps close and secure the phone. In the back are more sensors and will release the phone when you are ready. Every now and then those sensors don’t work as well but overall it works quite well.<br /><br />If you have a phone that can not be charged wirelessly fear not, you get some little charging heads that you would put into the charging port and that one will then charge your phone, very simple. This is beautiful and easy to use. The car charger also has an extra port in case you need to charge anything else. This is a fast charger so I am very happy.",1601853909029,0,False
5.0,"Perfect, keeps you organized and your phone charged","I really like this desk charger. For one it looks great, very classy and simple. I like that you get a pen holder on one side and on the other one you can wirelessly charge your phone while seeing anything that goes on with it because it is standing up. It is just plain perfect. I have a Samsung S20+ and it works very well. As long as it is plugged into a good wall charger it will fast charge just fine.<br /><br />You get the desk charger and a cable but you do need the adapter in order to make sure you can charge it, so that is the only downside with it that you don’t get the proper adapter with it. But we all have a lot of adapters around I am sure so you should be fine. Although in recent times they are shipping less and less adapters with their products because of that assumption. I for one am very happy with this though and can only recommend it. It is super easy to use and really helps keeping me organized.",1601820197591,0,False
5.0,Perfect extra security for my phone,"When I got my new phone it was time to protect it properly. I saw this and thought it was perfect. This lanyard actually attaches to the phone case and not the phone, then goes through the charging port hole and then a lanyard can attach to it. Now the lanyard is attached through the charging port hole to the actual phone case which is attached to the phone. I like it because it gives me a bit more security for the phone. I have a short lanyard attached to it that I usually wrap around my wrist so it is secured that way.<br /><br />If I travel I use a longer lanyard that I then put around my neck to give it more security that way and also can go hands-free when I need to. I really like this because I can quickly attach my phone to the lanyard and detach it when I want to. It is quick and easy but doesn’t attach to the actual phone but the case. It gives me extra security when I want and need it. For $7 you get 2 of these so one to spare or for a second case you may have. Very happy with this find.",1600565458053,1,False
1.0,Piece of c%@#,"Correction to my so review that is on the bottom still:<br /><br />I took this charger on my cruise and I tried to plug it in and it broke, the plug just collapsed completely and I was left with a little rattle. I can't recommend this at all. This is just plain crap. Loved it at first but couldn't even survive its first plug in on its first trip! Do not buy!<br /><br />I LOVE this little travel charger and it will from now go on all my travels with me. There is nothing worse than being in a new environment when you are away, mostly hotel rooms or on a cruise in your cabin, and you are not used to the layout and stumble around in the middle of the night trying to find the bathroom. Then you disturb the other person trying to sleep or worse hit your toes. With this travel charger you beat 2 birds with one stone. For one you always have a travel charger with you, but even better, it is a night light that allows you to have just a little light in the room that shows you where things are. It comes with 7 different lights so you can find the one that is the least annoying to you, I personally like the pink since it is not as bright as the white but still gives a lot of light).<br /><br />This charger is super easy to use and even better yet is a fast charger. Why anyone these days would even make a regular charger anymore is beyond me but you can still get those but thankfully this one is not one of them. IF your phone can be fast charged, this charger will recognize it and charge it appropriately. I love this one and it is absolutely perfect!",1580566059530,0,False
4.0,Nice wireless charing stand,"You can't beat this 2 in one battery pack. Not only does it serve as your charger when at your desk or on your nightstand, but you can also take this battery pack with you when you travel. I always bring a battery pack with me when i travel because I read, watch some downloaded movies on my phone or play games to entertain myself, which obviously tends to drain your battery. Not all plains still have a way to help you charge your battery so having one on you will help. It is not the largest battery pack I have but you don't always need that. It has a couple of outlets which is awesome in case you do want to share with your fellow travelers.<br /><br />Some people complain about the bright light in the front. Personally that does not bother me. Actually when i travel I like that because I use it as a night light. it helps getting around in a different room like a hotel room or the cruise ship room that you are not aware of and prevents you from bumping into things. So instead of having to bring a night light you can use this, which personally I like. For those who don't like it, just cover it up, easy.<br /><br />All in all I really like this and can only recommend it. Is it worth $70, maybe not exactly, probably closer to like $50 in my eyes but that is what it sells for right now so hopefully with time the price will lower a little bit.",1576067679595,0,False

5.0,Not exactly as advertised - durable yes but not completely confident in protection,"The Caseology Legion Violet Case for Galaxy S9 (2018) is a good product but not great.  After having it for about a year, there are a few things I like about it and others not so much.<br /><br />While the case is durable, easy to hold, and enables me to use all the ports, power button, and volume rocker easily, and it also works well with wireless charging, the case does not confidently protect a Galaxy S9.  The photos will show that the screen of the Galaxy S9 phone curves out further than the case can protect, if dropped.<br /><br />The photos also show a Zapp screen protector from before it cracked when the phone was knocked off a shelf approximately 3 feet onto vinyl flooring.  Both the case and the screen protector combined saved the phone and technically did their job.<br /><br />Notice the gap between the display and the screen protector and the case – it is not adequately protected.  That gap is sharp and a dust magnet.  Without the screen protector the case is fair, although it doesn’t account for the few millimeters of the phone screen rising above the edges of the case itself.  If dropped face down, the case will not protect the phone.<br /><br />You can also see in the photos; fingerprints are very easily seen on the color portion of the case that is also not textured enough for confidence with grip while holding the phone.  The SIDES of the case have an adequate grip, however even a light texture added to the back of the case would have been an appropriate addition.<br /><br />My personal experience with this case is that while it is a good product, it is not designed to protect an S9 with the curved screen bulging past the case.  This small discrepancy leaves S9 phones with little to no protection especially if dropped on a hard surface.<br /><br />I have not been able to find an decent screen protector to work with this case.  This could be a design flaw of the phone because when researching cases and screensavers for the Galaxy S9 most everyone has the same complaint about the display of the phone curving toward the edge.<br /><br />My main concern is that this case advertises protection and after having it for nearly a year, I cannot say with 100% certainty this case would be a product I would purchase FOR protection.<br /><br />There will more than likely be a few of you out there who will point out that my phone was protected from the fall and you would be correct as I stated above.  However, a 3 foot drop onto a vinyl floor should not have caused ANY damage to any part of the device or screen protector.  That curved screen is not amply covered to be protected.<br /><br />Caseology is a good product, I have had a few cases prior that have all done the job described, however this is the only model I am not 100% confident to protect my device especially considering it states ""Reinforced Protection"".",1559947185389,3,True

5.0,Good Price,When I bought my new phone I discovered an ugly new trend among cell phones. They are NO longer providing charging ports with your phone. Just another way for these companies to make more money for their overpriced crap. They wanted over 30 dollars for the same charger at Verizon plus another 100 for a case and who the hell knows what they wanted for a glass protector. I bought all three of these for less than the price of the charger they wanted to sell me.

4.0,Great case BUT creates an ECHO on speaker phone for the OTHER party when used with the 2020 SE,"I love this case as it is clear and protective.  However, I had a weird situation occur.  EVERYONE I called, when talking to them on speakerphone said the same thing:  They heard an echo on THEMSELVES only when they spoke.  When I spoke, they could hear me with no echo.  When they spoke, they heard an echo.  I heard no echo either way at my end and it didn't matter what the speakerphone volume was for this to occur.<br /><br />After over an hour with Apple Support, trying all sorts of things, the rep said, try taking off the case. And that fixed it!  So, rather than return the case, I cut out the two spots on the bottom of the case that cover the speaker holes on the bottom of the iPhone 2020 SE, and that stopped the echo while still using this case.<br /><br />Hope this helps others with this rather unusual issue, with this specific case when used with the 2020 iPhone SE",1591058735358,2,True

The beveled edge also protects the glass should you drop your phone.  I can't say enough good things about this case. I am brand loyal to Caseology as I have never experienced a problem with their products, and my phones have survived many unintended drops through my two year upgrade period.

5.0,Easy! Works beautifully on my J3 2016.,"Beautiful kit! Has everything you need: screen protector, clear instructions, alcohol infused cloths, dust removing tape, microfiber cloth, temporary hinge tapes and bubble diffusing cardboard piece. I didn't even need to use the cardboard piece... The hinge tapes are a truly inspired idea! They help you position the screen on your camera and keep it in the correct position until you are ready to proceed with exposing the sticky side.<br /><br />So, I positioned the screen protector with the wonderful hinge tapes. Then I flipped it back up and cleaned the phone's screen with the alcohol infused cloth, and I wore nitrile gloves because handling isopropyl alcohol with bare hands is simply not a good idea (per Hulda Regehr Clark - The Cure for All Diseases). Then, I decided it's really a good idea to just keep the gloves on for the rest of the operation, so as to avoid accidental smudges/fingerprints in the work area.<br /><br />After the alcohol cleaning, I used the dust removing tape, which worked nicely. Then, I pulled the backing off the screen protector and gently let it drop into place onto the phone. To my amazement, it just very naturally adhered to the phone, without any further input from me. I could see the contact area spreading at a good pace and leaving absolutely no air bubbles in its wake. It just kind of married up with the screen of its own accord, as if by magic. No further work needed from me. It fell perfectly in place and with no air bubbles whatsoever (have I mentioned that before...?)! Wow! How cool is that???<br /><br />The screen protector looks very nice on the phone and it cleans easily too. Lines up perfectly with all the needed connections on my J3 2016.

These just floated around in the hole, the cable ends were tight.<br />Sadly, a waste of my time. They are going back pronto.",1468961854000,2,True

The battery life is truly great! Also, the speakerphone setting delivers very clear sound both ways. This phone looks and feels solid and delivers on those promises.

But there is a small place on the right part of my screen that doesn't register the s pen. It won't mark on the screen at all in that place. And the battery life sucks really bad. But it does charge super fast so that's a plus. Overall it's not a bad phone but the price is too much. Almost $500 for a phone I can't write memos or lists on. Ridiculous.

3.0,"Great case for the price, although it sacrifices speakerphone/mic audio quality during Facetime","I was a little skeptical about the quality of this product for its price-point, but I needed a case for my phone before vacation and Lifeproof hadn't released one yet for the 7+. I ran the waterproofing test as directed, it worked great! No leaks. Which is big for me as that will also keep dust out of the case which really is my biggest complaint about Otterbox cases.<br /><br />As for the sturdiness of it, it seems well built in its minimalist design, however, I'm not going to try dropping it just to find out though. I have accidentally had some low drops with no damage; therefore so far, so good.<br /><br />I didn't notice any problems until I tried using the speakerphone, tried using Facetime, and tried playing video/audio over the speakers. The speaker and mic on the bottom of the 7+ are pretty much useless with this case blocking/muffling incoming and outgoing audio. I guess I shouldn't expect Lifeproof quality in every aspect at such a lower price.<br /><br />Overall, it is a good case that's why I gave it 3 stars and not 2 or 1. It does what it says. It sturdily protects the phone and keeps out water and dust, you just have to sacrifice some audio to save the money between this and a Lifeproof.

But after six months with this case, I can tell you my phone is still alive and my case is still intact so I say it's a win.<br />The only really annoying thing is that the technical genius who molded the plastic layer that wraps around the inner hard shell didn't put the hole for the earphones in the right place. Duh. Instead of inserting the earphone into the hole (in the wrong place) you have to peel back the tab to insert the piece, exposing the phone and making it less waterproof, which if you don't live in a place where you go running in the rain then okay, but I do.

I'm that way...my hubs says I research a purchase to death.  I do not agree with any of the reviews less then 4 stars for this cover.  This is a beautifully crafted leather cover.  I got the light brown.  I've had several friends ask me if the cover was done by Coach, as it looks this nice.  I could hardly believe when I opened the nice packaging it comes in that I only paid $7.99 with Prime for it.<br />I wanted a cover that would fully protect my s7 as I am extremely hard on my smartphones.  I got this, and more, in this cover.  I have dropped it several times, on accident, and I can tell it is fully protected just like I needed.<br />It feels nice in my hand, opened and closed.  It adds very little volume to my phone.  The buttons and charge port are very easy to access.<br />I really couldn't be happier with my purchase.  I feel confident this will hold up for the entire life of my Samsung s7 edge.<br />I paid $7.99 as mentioned before and this was not a discounted item nor was I compensated in any way to write this review.<br />I would buy this again a hundred times over.

It's  too much of a pain to return this to a UPS Drop-off or Amazon locker in these days of virus so I will suck up the cost. I guess I'll try taking a knife to it to expose the phone's actual buttons. Shame, because I love the look of it and it feels good when it's on the phone. Looks like it would provide excellent protection.<br /><br />Edited to add that Frankenstein-ing the case didn't work. The hard interior shell sets the buttons too far away from the gel portion of the case to allow you to make contact. After examining the purchase I cut out, I'm still not sure why it doesn't makr contact. It appears to be lined up correctly and the depth of the rubber contacts seems correct.

I would like a privacy flap to hide my credit cards when I fold it open to use but whatever. Not enough of a concern to remove a star.<br /><br />I love carrying around a &#34;book&#34; instead of a phone.

I have not dropped my phone, I do not usually drop my phones I take care of them but it is better to be safe than sorry. Works with wireless charging pads with the case on. The case also has enough protection around the front side of the case to your screen when putting down your phone screen side down on a desk or table. You can add a screen protector if you like, I do not use one since I am careful with my phones. These newer phones come with a stronger glass screens than they used to before and I have not had any issues with mine so far, no drops, no cracks, no finger prints either. I figured the fingerprint sensor would work better without the screen protector also.",1620168896064,1,True

This case is nice, slim, light weight, but strong enough to hold the phone tightly and holds the S-pen in its place and will not fall off but also easy to pull it out when you need to use it.

I think the thing I have enjoyed the most is that in the month I have owned it, it has never crashed or had any bugs. This is a rarity in my experience with Android phones. My critique would be the finger print scanner. It's located on the right side of the phone and you use your thumb to unlock it. It works about half the time. The problem seems to be that phone cases get in the way, blocking the access partially. I have bought and tried two cases and both had the same issue.

It is of quality material, a rose gold, faux leather, embossed with a boho design. The inside has a pocket for your license, which I don't use because the license sticks out past the credit card due to the internal snaps, and I use the credit cards more than the license. The extra slot on the inside flap makes it so I can carry another cc or a punchcard. I prefer not carrying my purse around everywhere, and this allows me to run into a store or gas station without it. Will definitely purchase another one,",1643167582831,5,True
2.0,Needs a bit of work,"It’s not particularly thin, but seems to be strong. However, I am disappointed by the fit around the bottom camera as others said.

2.0,Not as good as the one for iPhone,I have basically the same case for my iPhone and it was a very nice the weather in the back to prevent it from sliding but this one does not have the same back. The other thing about it is that the plastic cover for the screen would cause a double tap anytime I tried using it. I ended up removing the screen cover and only using the other parts. I love Ballistics products in general but felt they dropped the ball on this one.,1397506745000,0,True
5.0,Great,I got an Iphone 4s as my company phone and wanted to make sure it was protected. As a computer tech i move around a lot and get into tight places to run wiring.

3.0,Not for edge screens,I love the matte screen look but the only down side to this is it doesn't stay wrapped around the edge screen. So it pops up in my case.

4.0,Mostly good,"As of this writing, only the black case was available on Amazon so I purchased the red one direct through Supcase.  I've been loyal to this brand for years and they've protected my devices from what I thought was sure destruction more times than I can remember.<br /><br />This is my first edge case, however, and my first impressions are good, but not great.  The clear back looks sharp but I question its durability.  I also have camera protectors put on and while they fit through the opening, my phone no longer lays flat as it did with the case I had on while waiting for this one to arrive.  Not a deal breaker but I wish the camera protectors, which do not add bulk, were flush to this case's backing.<br /><br />Finally, I had to remove the fingerprint ""dot"" on the inside of the screen protector for two reasons: the first being that it was touch and go with whether or not it worked; secondly (and the ultimate reason I peeled it off) the dot was too visible, impeding my viewing experience.  The dot was completely transparent but its edges let me know it was there at all times, which was very distracting.<br /><br />All in all, I love the frame of the supcases as well as its screen protectors compared to the peel-n-stick ones that come with competitor brands.  I'm going to give this one a try but I may go back to the original style that has nontranspant back plate if I feel this one's durability isn't up to the task.  It is sharp looking for sure, but at the end of the day, protecting my device is priority.  I hope this does the job.",1677023971375,1,False

5.0,Great Sturdy Phone Case,"Bought this phone case as I was in need of a new one. The case is very simple and sturdy.<br />One thing I look at when buying a case is the compatibility with my screen protector. There were so many time when the case and protector didn't work together and would cause the protector to pull away from screen and leave the screen bare.

Last time I tried a pen I had to be careful of my hands, but not with this one. The palm rejection works and it makes taking notes easy. My signatures actually look like my signature. The battery life is good. I used it a little each day and still have a charge after almost a month. I thought I’d need a heftier product since I tend to use heavier, more bulky mechanical pencils, but the light pencil feel is comfortable.

It also has a screen protector on it.<br />Pros.. a drop will NOT break your iPhone or it's screen if you have this case on. I LOVE that b/c I resell all my iPhones and I liek to know that they don't looked scuffed or marred.<br />There is also a bit of protection against water damage as many of the possible entry points are covered. -- You have flaps that cover these, and to get to the items under them you have to pull up a very strong rubber flap -- points are the mute button, charge port, and headphone jack. But not totally water proof so as always be careful.<br /><br />cons - bulky<br />Can be a bit of a pain to put on.<br />finger-print sensor is not as quick but quick enough<br />touch can be a little less responsive<br />those strong rubber flaps are really a pain.<br /><br />I'm keeping mine though.

4.0,Secure hold from windshield mount....amplifying is average.,"The IPhone car mount comes with two methods of mounting, one is on the car windshield, and the other on the vent.  Mounting from the windshield is much easier, but it depends on how large this mount/phone can become distracting to your windshield vision.  You can pivot the mount for landscape view of the GPS.  The arm of the mount is sturdy and the suction works well, making adjustments with confidence that it won't become dislodged.  The spring-loaded clip seems sturdy and supportive.<br /><br />The cradle for the phone is where the sound amplifying wires are located.  I think the amplifying was not much more, but a little noticeable.  The amplifying is meant to double the sound, but I did not quite experience that quality of amplification.<br /><br />Attaching this to the vents is more challenging and apparently, some vehicles provide easier attachment, and I chose the window mount.  Much better, and with a cleaner look.  But, you can choose to leave the phone in the cradle, easy to remove if needed.  ........Rizzo",1299543649000,1,False
3.0,"Nice feature, but be careful as construction of plastic is less than very sturdy","To get a decent stand for the Iphone camera, I like this, however, be gentle with the tripod flexible legs, because if you move it too much or too hard, it can become frustrating to get the right position.  And I do like the many ways this tripod can be flexed to fit various structures, plus ability to wrap around a structure for various positioning.  But, be patient with wrapping it and having a secure hold.  And, it is easy to position for landscape or portrait shots.<br /><br />Sometimes the tripod takes some getting used to, some maneuvering around, but in time, you can become more comfortable with setting it up.<br /><br />The snap-on bumper that holds the phone is delicate, be sure you know how to snap it on and remove it.  The clip that holds the phone is also rather delicate plastic.  And, leave it on your Iphone if preferred.  There is also an adaptor that will screw on to hold a digital camera.  That is an added feature to the apparatus, to be able to hold your digital camera. The tripod is a nice feature, but I feel too much manipulating, removing and putting on, can damage the lightweight plastics.  .....Rizzo",1299470282000,7,False

3.0,2nd Review - Still not the greatest case (but I really WANT to like it...),"So I have used this product for over a week and though I feel that it is a tough case and I like that, the rubber that goes around the edges is a little weak and rather annoying. Every time I take it out of my purse I have to make sure all of the little flaps are closed (and the one at the bottom is already having a hard time maintaining its shape) and having to open the top flap to use my headset is REALLY a design flaw. The few times I tried to put it in my pocket - forget about it - rubber slipping out of placement left and right. I will change my rating from two stars to three but if I can find a case that is as tough but with a better design I will be switching over ASAP. Sad Day.<br /><br />(PREVIOUS REVIEW): This is not a complete review. I have made one phone call with the case on. I really like this case because it seems pretty solid. (I am looking for a solid case because I bought 2 $80+ Mophie juice pack air cases because I liked the battery idea but after both of them breaking after one fall off of a counter I decided I needed something a little tougher.) Like some others have said the rubber feels a little wimpy (again, I have not had the chance to throw it in my purse and see if it survives) and it sure collects cat hair but who cares. So here it is: I have to write and give a bad review because I cannot believe this problem exists and it is a deal breaker for me. The top flap that goes over the hole where the headphones plug in doesn't line up with the hole on the phone itself.<br /><br />To clarify, if you are looking at the top of the phone without the case on it, it looks like this:<br />._____________________<br />[_O__._|______===____]<br /><br />And with the case on the hole is here:<br />._____________________<br />[____O_|______===____]<br /><br />To use the head-set I would have to open the flap and plug in the headset with the flap bent back. To some this might be no problem at all but if I buy a product it should work without jerry-rigging, and since I use the headset all of the time this inability to quickly plug it in without fiddling with little flaps is not ok. And yes, before some yell at me - I know that the hole they have there is probably intended for the little noise cancelling microphone that is next to the jack but that still doesn't change the fact that one has to prop open the rubber flap, thus stretching the chintzy rubber even more So...I wrote to the company to see if this is just a problem with this batch or if this is just a design flaw and I should shop elsewhere. I will update this review as things happen.",1309387234000,0,True

5.0,"At Last! A Power Plug That Does ""Turbo""","Most chargers do it at a trickle. Since we are apt to keep our gadgets plugged in when not in use, this is a safety point for the gadget. However, sometimes you need a quick boost, as in you've been using your phone all day, especially when times get busy at work, and you suddenly realize it's one o'clock, you have a meeting at two, and your phone battery is down to 20%. This plug has a quick-charge feature, like the ""Turbo-Power"" plugs that Motorola provides with their cell phones, where you are guaranteed a full charge in about fifteen or twenty minutes, so this is perfect for those times when you've only got a short time to charge. Plus the plug folds back so that you can just toss it in a backpack or purse.<br /><br />Please note that the charging cord connections in this plug are USB C, NOT standard USB.

I would not put anything larger than a phone on it, although it might support a 7 inch tablet in a horizontal position.

5.0,Almost Perfect,"I ordered another fine-point capacative stylus like this last  year. I also liked that one, but it was quite quirky and turned off too quickly. This one is better: it stays on longer and is longer in length so it fits all but the hugest ""paw."" The blue light that indicates power is easier to see, and I like the rubber cap for the point and also the cover for the charging port, although the magnetic attraction on the latter is not strong enough. If you put the rubber point cap over the charging port cover while you're using the stylus, when you pull the rubber point off it it takes the cover right off.<br /><br />Again, my complaint is that there is NOTHING to attach this stylus to your tablet. Pens have pen clips, why doesn't this thing? Included with my stylus was a ""gift"" of two square flaps of stiff vinyl, with an elastic loop on each. This elastic loop fits around the stylus, so I take it it's supposed to be some sort of gadget to keep the stylus with the tablet, but I can't really figure out how it's supposed to work, unless you're supposed to tuck it under the tablet in your tablet case and then fold the tablet cast closed around it (if your tablet case allows that), but I don't know, because they came with no instructions.<br /><br />I don't suppose the darn thing could beep or something before it decides it's not been used enough and powers down. It is very aggravating when you are working with it, pause to think, and it shuts down and you think your tablet  has frozen instead.<br /><br />I must say that this stylus is very accurate in use with drawing. Other styluses that I have used start their lines a millimeter or two to the right or left of the actual pen point; this is pretty accurate! If you are just goofing off trying to trace a photo, it makes your drawing come out very nice indeed.<br /><br />Pros: Long, light, accurate, very sensitive to touch<br /><br />Cons: No PEN CLIP, no shutoff warning, connector cover magnet weak.<br /><br />And please, how do I properly use the ""gift"" that comes with the stylus?",1552915657588,0,False
5.0,"Oh, Finally!","I was talked into getting a Google Pixel when they first came out. Let's say I was less than enchanted with it, and I still refer to it as ""U.P."" (Useless Phone). One of the things I missed from my previous phone, a Droid Turbo, was the ability to use a feature called USB on the Go. This meant you could plug a thumb drive with the proper connection into the charging port and you could therefore copy files from the thumb drive to the phone and vice versa. I was astonished that you could not also do this with the fancy, much vaunted upon Pixel.<br /><br />Over the years I have bought several of these double connector thumb drives (with a regulation USB connector at one end and a USB-C type connector at the other) in the vain hope that the newest model would connect with this daft Pixel, but no dice. Still hoping, I ordered this Leizhan thumb drive, which, once again, worked perfectly with my computer, but the stupid Pixel would not read the drive, even though it now had a different, upgraded version of the operating system than when I bought it.<br /><br />And then...I asked for help again on the Pixel assistance board, and someone advised me what to do (it involved going into a setting menu and changing something), and this lovely flash drive FINALLY WORKS with my phone. I can't believe how long it took to get this to happen.<br /><br />The drive is great; very fast, plugs securely into both the computer and into the phone. I am very pleased!",1548643940318,0,False
3.0,I Can't Get This to Work; Am I Doing Something Wrong? UPDATED,"My original review of this is below. I received a stylus that did not work. I contacted Vine about this and they sent me a new one immediately. Thank you, Vine personnel!<br /><br />The reason I wanted to try this one is that most styluses are so clumsily tipped! They just have a big soft nub of rubber and when you are working on a small screen as on a 7-inch tablet or a phone it will pick two letters or two numbers at the time on a virtual keyboard. I have gone crazy looking for something with a tinier stylus tip and this looked good. I thought if this worked out I would buy another for my husband, who is constantly complaining that his stylus tip is too large.<br /><br />In general I like this. I charged it overnight, then unplugged, turned it on and it worked without me needing to twist the tip to adjust the signal. It works on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 4, both 7"" and 10"" versions, and also on my Pixel phone (and that is such a temperamental little twit that a lot of things don't work with it). Sadly, the stylus doesn't seem to work as well on my touch-screen Acer Windows laptop, but I have only tried it in one program that was not made for use with a pen. It might work on another app better.<br /><br />I've only been using it to read magazines and do some cleanup work on files on my tablet, so I haven't explored it totally. I tried downloading a drawing program on the 10"" tablet, but the pen didn't work that well, but the app wasn't rated that well, either, and it didn't work that well with my normal stylus, either. I did find if I used it while I was reading and didn't turn pages fast enough, it goes into standby mode and then I wonder why it's not working until I realize the light is not on. I need to test it further on something like an app that lets you use handwriting input.<br /><br />What I really, really dislike about this stylus is that there is no way to fasten it to ANYTHING. It has no clip so you can clip it to your pocket or to your tablet case, or a ring so you can put a ""leash"" on it. It's not even magnetic. If I gave one to my husband he would promptly lose it! What's with the no clip or no method of keeping it leashed??? Even a cheap Bic pen has a clip!<br /><br />====================================================<br /><br />I charged this via a USB plug. I noticed immediately that the charging cord plug does not go all the way into the stylus; there is still a sixteenth of an inch of the charging cord plug showing. It went from red to blue and charged all night. But when I took it off the charger and pressed the button to turn it on, there was no light. I take it a light is supposed to come on when you press the button and will stay on until the battery runs down and it will turn red. I get no light at all.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this. Did I do something wrong? Was overnight (12 hours) too short to charge it? Is it because the mini-USB plug does not go all the way in the pen? I have tried all ways pressing the button.<br /><br />Is there any way to get one that WORKS????",1544555428172,0,False

They seem to be as responsive as the Adonit even if the small circular clear plastic nib appears to be on a rubbery flexible thick strand of rubber rather than the metal point in the Adonit. The Meko has a nice grip handle as well as a pen clip that will actually go on the cover of my tablet. You also have a mesh-covered regular stylus at the other end.<br /><br />Note: I am not using this for drawing, just for reading books on my tablets, so I do not know if they have the fine control for artwork. The Adonit may be preferable there.",1533225305607,6,True

5.0,Glad I Didn't Get the Galaxy 5!,"I am flat-out in love with this phone. We had gone into the Verizon store intending to get Samsung Galaxy 5 phones, but they were offering this phone for ""free"" (with 2-year renewal, of course) and when the representative heard we were looking for good battery life she recommended the Droid Turbo. We started out with Droid phones for our first smartphone, and we really liked them. These were upgraded to a Galaxy Nexus; our first two were so bad (husband's rebooted constantly, and mine kept locking up) we had to return them for replacements. The Galaxy Nexus was a useful phone, but it ate battery way out of proportion of what I did with it. We had to have two spare batteries just to get through a long day at a SF convention.<br /><br />But I've never been ""in love"" with a phone until this Turbo. The battery life isn't what the specs say, but I can play podcasts all day, check the weather, send texts, make calls, use Waze and still have battery life at the end of the day without having to charge it; sometimes it doesn't go under 50 percent. That is downright amazing compared to the old Nexus. I love the Moto Voice feature in which you address the phone with a customized pass phrase and it will call someone on your contact list, look up the temperature outside, post to Facebook, and/or feed you the headlines. The screen is absolutely gorgeous; from photographs on Facebook to YouTube videos to the icons on your screen, the picture is sharp-edged and brilliant with vivid colors. The response time is quick. The camera isn't bad at all, except for a slightly slow response time, and I frequenly find myself leaving my camera behind for small parties and close-up photography because the phone app does the job so well. Sound is good considering it's a phone and I can finally hear it; I could turn the Nexus up to full volume and still not be able to make out what was being said.<br /><br />As far as I can tell, there's nothing this phone can't do, or I haven't run into it yet.",1422285573000,5,False
5.0,Just What I Was Looking For,"Last year on our vacation, both my husband and I brought our netbooks with us. Going through airport security with them was annoying: they had to be pulled from their cases, turned on, then returned to their cases while we also juggled putting on shoes, a purse, hubby's C-PAP unit, and our coats. Since I had a blog function on my Droid (Droid 1, aka the Milestone), I grumbled that all I would have needed was a keyboard for the thing, like the Stowaway keyboard I used to have with my HP Jornada: I used to be able to get on chat via a plug in modem, post to my blog, even work on a short story if desired.<br /><br />So it was with anticipation and, yes, a bit of skepticism that I purchased this Freedom Pro keyboard after reading the reviews here, after noting that most of the negative reviews had to do with Droid Evo units.<br /><br />I give many thanks to the reviewer ""Daniel"" who posted such clear advice about setting up this keyboard with Android drivers and for the link to the instructional video. Except for one bobble, which was my fault for not reading the directions clearly enough, these instructions made the setup quite easy and I was typing in no time.<br /><br />I was pleased with the keyboard, which is stronger and much more substantial than the Stowaway I had for my PDA. I do not feel I have to ""bang"" on the keys to get this product to respond. The hideway stand for the Droid is also quite useful.<br /><br />Yes, because this is a foldaway unit and meant to be small, the keys are not precisely where they would be on a normal computer keyboard, and some keys are smaller. The shift key at right is particularly small. However, this is perfectly useful for note taking, blogging, posts to Facebook, and any other small typing chores you wish to do on your smartphone. You may not be able to get up to 60 wpm, or write the Great American Novel on it, but for small writing tasks it is very useful.",1302532969000,4,True

4.0,"It’s ok…fits well, but I believe  protection claims are overstated.","BEASTEK for iPhone 12 Waterproof Case is an ok case for the price and intent.  I got this for my 13 year old Son’s phone.  I like having a robust case given his age and the mag safe feature is something he had been wanting.  The extent of protection as claimed in the ad I question though.<br /><br />My two major complaints would be the plastic liner that covers the switch to cycle silent mode.  The plastic linear works so far and currently is “water resistant” but over time I believe this could be a failure point.  Second is the muffled sound. This hinders quality but I expected there would be a lose in speaker sound quality due to design.  You can’t cover a speaker that emits sounds waves that vibrate and not expect a drop in quality.<br /><br />Material used for the is case is average. The case itself is not bulky and feels good in my hand.  I have a tempered glass screen protector on his phone and  the case works fine even with the built in one.  He has had no degraded touch capabilities.  Charging the phone works with no issue on a mag safe and regular wireless charger.<br /><br />Picture/video quality appears the same as without the lens covers. However, smudges will appear on lens covers.  Be aware of this prior to taking pictures or videos.<br /><br />Overall, it is an ok case that provides protection.  I have had no issues as of yet with design or functionality however, my biggest gripe…does the level of protection meet the stated claims in the ad. I do not know nor do I want to find out.  None are substantiated by quantitative data.<br /><br />Value wise the price is appropriate based on design and quality.  I have no issues with that.<br /><br />Interesting info to better inform others.<br /><br />They use the term waterproof but the rating referenced “IP68” uses the term water resistant and only to 1.5 meters (4 feet 11 inches) for 30 minutes.  It is water resistant as I tested in my sink but as stated in the ad I would not want to find out if it meets the claimed depth.<br /><br />Per ad “Safe in water under 33ft even after 1000 times test of using for one hour exceeding IP68 rating, great protection for any underwater activities or outdoor/daily use”.<br /><br />Also, I believe the case does provide drop protection.  Whether it was dropped 1000 times from 9ft and survived as stated…I will believe it when they provide me the test report.  FYI, 810G, method 516 is shock testing and not stated is which procedure was used for the testing.  Was it functional shock, transport shock?  I can tell you the test specification do not call out dropping the test article 1000 times no matter what procedure is used.

Also, I just slide the loop around the bank to charge my watch instead of removing the band. I can’t comment on other style watch covers and if they will work with the charging pad. The battery bank itself also charged quickly.  I have charged and discharged the battery bank twice to charge all my items twice until the bank was dead.<br /><br />Overall, It is well build and designed.

4.0,Descent band but has one concern,"[[VIDEOID:3e4c193929c9fe41db22f1eea987a402]] The band is well made using quality material. It was semi comfortable to wear, see below and the Velcro hooks securely adheres to the piles.<br /><br />The only issues that stood out to me were the size of the metal buckle.  It is large and the placement of the buckle landed it on the inside of my wrist resting near my bone and it slightly irritated me.  I could possibly contribute this due to my small, skinny wrist.  Also, the band connectors when slide into the watch body are loose and do not fit as tight as an Apple Watch band, see video.  The connectors stay secure but it did concerns me.  I want others to be aware of this, especially since this is advertised as a rugged use band.",1672706001939,0,False
5.0,Fits great and can’t beat for the price!,"Great affordable case…I’m completely happy with it.  Very easy to install and remove your phone from the case.  It can be done in seconds with no annoying clips.<br /><br />The 2 in 1 structure fits together nicely. The shock sleeve is soft but very durable and ridged.  It will hold up to use and not become flimsy or lose it shape.  The outer shell provides nice protection without making the case bulky or heavy.  It still fit nicely in my hand once I installed it.<br /><br />All cuts outs, buttons align perfectly and do not hinder functionality. The tempered glass screen protector I have installed on my phone was not affect by the case.<br /><br />The raised edge depth created by the case is great and provides an ample lip to help avoid surface contact and protection if dropped.  Especially, the camera lens area which is a worry of mine.<br /><br />I had no issues when wireless charger my phone and I tried the case with multiple chargers.<br /><br />For the price you can’t beat the protection it provides.",1672591721601,0,False
4.0,Band connection to watch are loose which concerns me.,"[[VIDEOID:bafd7f783d0934f7b55c572bd5c9367d]] *Update* I have wear for sometime now with no issues due to the loose connectors.<br /><br />First, I really like the band but the loose connections at the watch are a concern to me.  However, with that said I have went for a run, washed the car, did chores with no failure. The connections have held.  I don’t know if the connections being loose is a one off or an actually quality control/escapement issue.<br /><br />I do not have an apple trail loop so I cannot directly compare to the OEM.  I purchased my watch with with the nylon rugged loop. I do have other apple sport loop bands which I did use for comparison.<br /><br />So, with that said. I like the look and feel of the band.  The material used is soft and the stitching seems to be well done.  The Velcro pads are securely attached to the band.  That leads me to my first issue which is the bond created by the Velcro hooks and piles.  It doesn’t seem to be as strong as I would have expected and compared to my Apple sport loop band.  At this point, I haven’t had any issues with it as of yet the Velcro stay secure.  As the material wears some I assume it may become stronger.<br /><br />My biggest concern is the connections points and how loosely they attach to the watch.  As you can see in the video the fit is loose and beyond what I consider reasonable.  I did compare this to my Apple sport loop band and the connectors were tight at the watch with no wiggle.<br /><br />Overall, the band is an affordable alternative to the more expensive Apple trail loop.",1671313587760,0,False
5.0,Battery worked great!,I replaced the battery in my son’s Astro A50 gen 2 headset. The battery has worked great.  The old battery was only working for 2 hours on a single charge.  The new battery has it back to about 15 hours on a single charge.,1671220375690,0,True
4.0,Affordable alternative to more expensive tactical bands.,"I’m prior military, the style of the band and how it’s made reminds me of my rigger belt that I would wear.  Overall, the quality is average but not bad for the price point.  That being said, it’s and affordable band which makes it a good alternative to similar higher priced bands that are out there.  I do not have another band similar but it met my expectations.<br /><br />Size:  I do not have the biggest wrist at 7”. The normal size says it fits 6.5” but I would say 6.85” to 7” would be the lower end of the spectrum.  If it is a little big nylon can shrink some under heat, such as in a dryer.  I plan to soak mine in hot water and give it a tumble wrapped in a towel.<br /><br />Also,  upon initially wearing I notice the nylon is stiff but that is normal when new. It takes wearing to loosen it up.<br /><br />My only concern is the coating on the stainless steel metal components. I wonder how well the coating will stand up to basic wear.  So far so good on that.",1671155995494,0,False
5.0,Great 3 in 1 charging station!  Worth the price.,"This is well designed and all featured functioned as you would expect.  The product came nicely packaged with clear instructions including pictures.  Overall, I have no complaints.<br /><br />Watch charging pad:<br />As you can see by the pictures the wire is routed behind the phone charging pad and in the base.  Note it has a USB-C and A port. Good thinking by the designers since the charging cable for the watch has two options.  It charged my watch with no problems and quickly…I have a 49mm ultra watch for reference.  Note the unit uses the charging pad/cable that comes with the watch.<br /><br />Phone charging pad:<br />I have no complaints, there is plenty of room for my iPhone 12 Pro and the watch.  FYI, I have a Body Glove Tidal waterproof case and my phone charged with no issues.  My son’s generic case also worked with the charging pad.<br /><br />AirPod charging pad:<br />AirPods are not pictured, but it did charge without issue my son AirPods Pro gen2 with a silicone case.<br /><br />The touch led power switch worked without issue.  The light at the base of the unit is bright.<br /><br />I recommend this product as a good buy and consider it worth the price.",1671061173842,0,False
5.0,"Great case, reminds me of an Otterbox Defender.","Awesome Otterbox clone, reminds me of a defender case.  This is a two piece case with 2 screen protectors…not tempered glass.  Case is still a great value even though screen protector isn’t tempered glass.<br /><br />The case is well made, the inner hard shell has soft rubber material on the inside to prevent slippage and wear while your phone is in the case. The iPhone 12 fit tight in the inner hard shell, which snaps together easily. The outer sleeve is rubber but made from a robust and highly durable material in my opinion.  It appears it could stand up to wear and tear.  This also is a very tight fit in the inner hard shell.<br /><br />The screen protector is easily applied and the hard inner shell case can act as a guide during application.  Note it is not a tempered glass screen protector.  If you already have a screen protector on your phone the case won’t interfere with it.  Update…I did put a tempered glass screen protector on the phone after the fact.<br /><br />Wireless charging worked with no issues on two different chargers.  The should hold up well.",1670883294874,2,False
3.0,Was left unimpressed...needs improvement,"I have been using this product for a week now.  After taking it out of the box I was unimpressed and after using the product I was still left unimpressed.  The product has quality, functionality and design issues. I tested the products functionality out using my iPhone 12 and AirPods Pros.  Note, I have an Ultra 49MM watch and the product was not designed for that size according to the ad.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />The charging unit is very light and compact.  Due to this there may be charging issues when just charging an apple watch.  You may also have issues charging a phone and watch at the same time depending on phone/case, watch/case (see pictures).  The time is only in 24hrs, and this is noted in the product description.  The UNITEK LED light touch power button worked intermittently along with the touch alarm bottom.  This was frustrating to say the least.<br /><br />The look of the unit I like...modern slim design that does take up much space.  However, the material it is made out seems of low quality and is likely reflected in the price of the unit.  Just be aware of that if you buy.<br /><br />iPhone Charging:<br /><br />Did what it said it would and charged my phone in a reasonable amount of time.  I do have a case on my phone (Body Glove Tidal).  It will charge vertically and horizontally.  You may need to adjust the phones position to get it to start charging.<br /><br />Air Pods Pros:<br /><br />Similar results with my Air Pods Pros.  They did charge through the silicone case that I have on the OEM hardcase.  Again, in a reasonable amount of time and same as above with adjusting the position to start charging.<br /><br />iWatch:<br /><br />The charging pad for the watch is where the design comes into question.  It rotates out from behind the base.  It is poorly designed in my opinion, and I consider it flimsy.  The magnet is not as powerful as an apple magnet, so be aware your watch could fall off if you have a heavy case or band. Since this is a cantilever design the weight could also make the base wobble and tilt to the side if you try charging without your phone on it (my 49mm made is tilt to the side).  In addition, note the distant you have between my phone and watch pad in the picture (I do not have a max).  It is close and I don’t see how you would get both on easily.  You would have to shift the phone over. My 49MM would not fix on the pad with my phone on the charger.  The watch charging pads seems to have been a design after thought.",1665347838487,0,False

So, I came here and read customer reviews.<br /><br />This case fits perfectly.  It’s snug, lightweight (doesn’t add a lot of weight to the phone) and appears durable.  I live the metal bumper.  I adds to my sense of security.  The clear back let’s the beauty of the S 20 shine through.  I haven’t tested the durability, no drops, but it sure makes me feel secure.

The rod is still attached to the base but it falls to whatever side net weight is on.

1.0,Mmmmm it’s ok for $12,The stand is fine as long as you have a thin phone/don’t have a case on it. The lip where this phone sits in is very narrow. Other than that I wished it raised up a little higher. It’s ok for $12 if you just need a way to stand your phone up to see.

Easy to open and I don’t have to worry about lens scratches. I did have glass covers but they smudged pretty easy, and degraded the quality of the pics a bit.<br />The only thing about this case is that I have a tough time MagSafe charging. I don’t know if it’s that the magnet isn’t strong enough or the charge can’t go through the case as well… it will charge with MagSafe but you have to be mindful that the lightning bolt is lit up (on the phone) is on because it doesn’t always hit the right spot or something.

3.0,Easy for travel - not that great a charger,It takes a long time to charge your phone and/or watch.

After I wrote the review they reached out to me to find out how they could help and how to resolve the issue. I have bought several other items from OUTXE and have always had excellent service - and the products are excellent. The ring for the phone is great to steady the phone - the most that can be asked for a magnet... it's just not the same as one that is stuck to the case with an adhesive.<br /><br />I use mine to steady my camera BUT… it can’t be counted on to help you not drop your phone like a regular ring. The magnet is strong when you are just resting it in your hand - and is a great kickstand… but if you turn your phone at all when your finger is in the ring it pops off. It is perfectly understandable why this happens (that’s how you take it off) … just saying … if you are used to a ring that uses an adhesive where you can spin your phone while taking a shot… you can drop your phone.,1634606043665,3,True

5.0,"Works well, easy to put on and remove",I've been using these protectors for a couple of months now and they're pretty great! You can pop them off and on pretty easily so you can change colors to match your mood or outfit if that's something you like to do. The one issue is that water gets trapped between the case and the screen if you use it in the shower or swimming which makes the touch screen act up but I don't think the touch screen works well in water anyway. I just make sure to remove it and dry both pieces off.,1621459490566,3,True

I do still think the case was worth what I paid for both items, but I absolutely agree with the other comments that it's virtually impossible to get all of the bubbles out. Also the screen protector seems to be like one millimeter wider than the opening of the phone case, so the entire right side of my screen protector is starting to peel up. I don't expect it to last very long but I'll use it until it needs to be replaced.<br /><br />The case itself though is wonderful. It's slim so it doesn't make the phone too bulky, with a great grippy texture.",1572464508106,0,True
3.0,Slightly too small for screen,"This screen protector is a few mm too narrow for my screen.  It works just fine, but there is a hairline of my screen that isn't underneath the glass and it can be frustrating to read things that go onto the edge of the screen.

I know everything in the mall is always more expensive just because its the mall. The guy originally told me it was $35 and when I told him I didn't have enough to buy it right now he told me he will sell it to me for $25 if I really wanted to buy it, so I bought it.

3.0,A Nice Idea That's Of Limited Use To Me,"The idea of having one place to organize and charge your various devices is a good one. Unfortunately, I suspect it's an idea that is already becoming outmoded. Simply put, a number of my most important devices have their own unique charging gear, stuff that is not compatible with this product. To give one example, my lifeline button has four copper nodes on the back that need to be in contact with the nodes on its charger in order to recharge itself. Another example is my cellphone, who's charger plugs directly  into an electrical outlet without using any usb connector. So the usefulness of this product is very limited for me.

4.0,"I like it as a tripod.  Selfie stick, not so much","I really like this tripod and I’ve had it for 2 1/2 years now.  The clamps feel solid and I like how easy they extend.  It is very light so it will fall over easily, like if my cats bump into it.  I’ve only used it indoors so I’ve never had to weigh it down.  The remote paired easily and still works.  I only have to charge it once in awhile.  I think this is more geared to be a tripod than a selfie stick.  As a selfie stick it is difficult for me to hold and is uncomfortable since I have small hands and it’s a little heavy for me.  You’re basically holding the 3 legs folded up in your hand so it’s really bulky for me.  So, I just use this mostly for the tripod to take pictures and video calls.  All in all it’s a decent product but I have to buy a selfie stick that has a smaller diameter grip.  I wish it would’ve worked as both equally.",1631634934215,0,True

My screen is the same as when I first got my phone.  The images on the screen are as if there is no screen protector so image quality is great.  My only complaint is that you get fingerprint smudging SO easily.  I have to constantly wipe it down with a microfiber cloth.,1597552456581,0,True

5.0,Love it!,"I finally got an iPhone and this was the first brand of screen protection I purchased for it.  A few days before it arrived, I got an e-mail from the company and had a link to videos on how to apply it to the phone.  It was extremely helpful.  I was able to put a new screen protector on my husband's iPhone (the old screen protector had quite a few bubbles) and I managed to almost have it perfect.  There were some very small bubbles but they weren't on the screen so he didn't mind.  He also liked the way it doesn't leave fingerprints.  I applied one to my iPhone and I had one bubble due to a spec of dust.  Even so, it was hardly noticeable.  I was going to leave it but I'm kind of OCD so I used my last one and that one I got PERFECT.  No bubbles at all.  The only con I have with it is that viewing pictures aren't as sharp anymore but at the cost of not having to clean the screen every five minutes, I can live with it.  Other than that, I absolutely love it and would recommend it to others.  Quick tip...air cans work wonders.",1309998445000,0,True

The case is made of a combination of PC and TPU materials which makes it shockproof and provides excellent protection for her phone.<br /><br />The slide camera lens cover is a great added feature as it ensures the camera lens is protected when not in use. The rotate kickstand is also very convenient and provides the perfect angle for hands-free viewing of videos and photos.<br /><br />The included 2 pack of tempered glass screen protectors is a great bonus, as it offers additional protection to the phone screen. My wife is very happy with the vibrant red color and the overall design of the case. It fits her iPhone 12 Pro Max perfectly and all buttons and ports are easily accessible.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a durable and stylish case for their iPhone 12 Pro Max.

4.0,decent case for the money,"I recently purchased the CANSHN Clear iPhone 12 Case/iPhone 12 Pro Case in the color purple and have been using it for a few weeks now. Overall, I have to say that I'm pretty satisfied with the case and would give it a solid 4 stars.<br /><br />One of the things that attracted me to this particular case was its military drop protection feature. I'm pretty clumsy and have dropped my phone more times than I care to admit, so I wanted a case that would give me some peace of mind in case of a mishap. So far, I haven't dropped my phone with this case on, but it definitely feels sturdy and well-made, so I'm confident it would hold up well in a fall.<br /><br />I also appreciate that the case hasn't yellowed yet. I've had clear cases in the past that have started to look dingy and discolored after just a few weeks of use, but this one still looks crystal clear. That being said, I do notice some smudges and fingerprints on the back of the case, which can be a bit annoying.<br /><br />The hard back and soft TPU bumpers provide good protection, but I do wish the case was a little thicker or had a more substantial feel to it. It's quite slim and lightweight, which is nice for carrying in my pocket, but it doesn't give me as much confidence in its protection abilities as some bulkier cases might.<br /><br />All in all, I think this is a solid case for the price. It offers good protection, doesn't yellow, and looks nice on my phone. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a clear case that provides some added drop protection.",1678728406490,0,False

So when I saw this long cord with a magnetic 90-degree end on it, I was elated.  I put the little plug into the iPad, no problem.  Next, I put the magnetic cable end on the iPad and everything seemed OK.  The light was on, it was charging, all was good.  I came back later, the iPad was not charging.  Ok, I just assumed it got bumped off.  I wiggled it around with no luck.  It would not charge.  I went back to my old cable and it worked great.  A few hours later I tried this one again.  This time it worked.  I spent some time on the iPad and it quit charging before it was full again.  This is when I found out my factory Apple wall plug with the USB port was VERY HOT.  It had gotten so hot that it quit working.<br /><br />After seeing how hot this got on my iPad, I will not be using them at all.  I really wanted this to work.  It looked so nice in the ad.

This unit covers a much larger area than my other one.  You will need to read and follow the instructions.  When you first look at this complete package you may be intimidated.  Just take it step by step and be prepared to get on the roof.  The antenna needs to be placed as high as possible.  The antenna and booster need to be over 20 feet apart for this to work properly.

I hooked it up ( pretty straight forward ) inside the house and checked both of our iPhones with and without it.  The bars went from 3-4 up to a full 5 bars.

Not worth the money in my opinion,1637334955097,0,True
5.0,Works Better Than Bulky Cases,"I've always been a person who bought otterboxes and other bulky phone cases. If it didn't have a silicone/rubber layer and then a hard case, I never wanted it. I've had such bad experiences with clear cases before that I never believed it worked.<br /><br />But then in November 2020, I decided to upgrade my phone. I got a pretty color of the S20+ and it was a shame to hide it in the bulky case I bought. Especially since I don't travel as often as I used to. I decided to have 2 cases - One for going out (bulky) the other clear for when I'm at home.<br /><br />Needless to say this case has been on my phone since December 2020 and is still going strong. It has been dropped 5 ft onto tile and concrete. It flew from my car holder and slammed into the floor. I have literally dropped this so many times and I'm shocked it's not very scratched.<br /><br />I've had my old iphones break from simply from my pocket onto the ground when getting out of my chair in an otterbox! I highly recommend this case and have bought hybrid cases for all my family and friends. They also love it.",1625208448107,3,True
5.0,Almost Perfect,"The original silicone bands are terrible and uncomfortable. I remember a coworker recommending these types of bands to me years ago when fitbits were the hit item.<br /><br />It's super comfortable, easy to install, and wears so well! The pink chainlink compliments my pink GWA2 very well. Unlike silicone, I didn't notice a nasty smell or dead skin building up on the wristband.<br /><br />The silicone cover has saved me so many times when I would have dented the aluminum body of the watch. However, the touch screen doesn't operate as smoothly even with sensitivity on max. Sometimes I notice I will accidentally activate an app or function while this is on and the sensitivity is up. But that's a small price to pay for the protection it gives.<br /><br />Minor complaint is the pink silicone cover is too""bright pink"" and doesn't not compliment the original watch color so I just use the clear one.<br /><br />Main issue I have that made me stop using it is I have an aluminum body laptop for work so I always got magnetized to my laptop while working or on random things like my stainless steel fridge.<br /><br />I would definitely wear it again if I ever travel again, but since I just stay at home another band will have to do.",1609909139038,0,True
4.0,Exactly What I Needed,The original silicone band was super uncomfortable so I had tried a magnetic one. Problem was I kept getting magnetized to my work laptop and that got annoying.<br /><br />I looked up leather options and found this product. I really like how the pink matches the shade of pink on my GWA2 and there's different clasp colors depending on your watch color.<br /><br />Not sure how long this will last because the band is a bit stiffer and has some height to it unlike leather bands on my regular watches that sit flat against my wrist so I notice more wear and tear. Otherwise it has held up pretty well and I would recommend anyone who like a more petite band to give this a try.,1609908526915,1,True
4.0,Great Phone Stand for Large Phones,"I've been an OMOTON fan since the first stand I bought years ago (the pink stand). It's not an exaggeration when I say the experience of owning my first OMOTON stand was life changing. I previously had used acrylic and plastic phone stands, but they always tipped over. When they first released an adjustable one (silver stand), I fell more in love with the brand. The adjustable quality make video calling and video watching on my phone so much easier. My boyfriend recently got a large phone that's fairly thick with a case on it. I knew I wanted to buy him an OMOTON stand and was intrigued by this current model and thought it would work well for him.<br /><br />This model (black stand in the photo) sits lower than the previous model and is heavy duty enough to accommodate his phone without tipping over. His phone can fit into my silver stand, but the fact that the stand sits lower allows him to easily rest his phone without it tipping forward if he angles it too low. The one and only con I have with the current model (black stand) is that the hinge doesn't move as smoothly as the previous version I purchased for myself (silver stand). If I were to be extra picky, I would say the material because more light weight compared to the other models, but it doesn't affect the durability of the product. I highly recommend this model if you have a very large phone, but otherwise I would recommend the previous model (silver) for that smooth sliding hinge.",1549174375215,19,True
5.0,Best Phone Case that's Cute and Affordable,"I got my first Iphone from work and I knew I wanted to go the whole nine yards - get a good case and use a glass screen protector. No way was I going to be stuck with this phone on a 2 year contract with it looking busted like most people I knew who owned an Iphone. I went to Best Buy and overpaid for an Otterbox case and an overpriced screen protector. Granted the otterbox wasn't the most bulky one, but I figured &#34;Hey you can't go wrong with the rubberized hard case.&#34; Wrong! I dropped my phone getting out of my car on the first day of putting all these gadgets on. My phone fell a few inches and it cracked the screen protector.<br /><br />I immediately returned the otterbox, got my $40 back, and purchased this one instead. I've had a few drops with this, but my gosh this is great! No scratches or cracks anywhere! And the pink blends beautifully with the rose phone color. Definitely worth the money and it's a pretty slim case too.",1528783532423,0,True

This case is two-toned: purple trimmed in pink. It does have some texture which makes it easy to hold. The holes/cutouts (for the earplugs, charger and camera)  are exact. This case is easy to apply. Just snap the pink one on first and the purple on last.  I will warn you, this case (once applied) give the phone some heft and style.

4.0,Definitely worth taking a look!,"The Yoobao 2000mAh Power Bank Portable Phone Charger is about the size of a cell phone but a lot heavier. It comes with a charging cable and directions. There are two USB ports, one type-C input, one micro input and one lighting input.  I like that you are able to charge multiple devices (2) at once. There is a LED display that shows the percentage of charge left on the device, during and after use. The time it took to charge my cell phone (android) wasn’t bad, but I couldn’t charge my Acer Spin 13 completely without shutting it down. I will warn you that charging the Yoobao was not fast. I found that it was easier and faster to fully charge the portable battery using my computer. In conclusion, I think the key selling point and what makes this device worth considering is the that fact that this is an inexpensive, portable (you can carry this device in your car, laptop/computer bag or purse) device that can charge multiple devices (android and iPhone) at once. I’d recommend taking a look. 4 stars",1546920672894,0,False
2.0,This seemed like a “hot” idea.,"The Wuloo Charging Stand seemed like a great idea when I ordered it, but in actuality, it isn’t. First, while assembling the charging stand is pretty simple (you just screw in the parts), it is somewhat inconvenient. So beware, this equipment requires some assembly on the part of the purchaser. Once that is completed, it looks really cool but there are some basic things that I would change. It does not come with a charging brick (portion that goes into the wall), so if you expect this stand to come with everything you need it doesn’t. You will have to locate one which seems to defeat the purpose. If you purchased this device to replace a lost or broken one, you’ll still need to order the brick separately. And to charge it, you must be plugged into a USB. I also notice that the wire or charging cord does not stay in the charger very well. And while none of these things by themselves is a big deal, in the totality of things it makes this product less attractive. And just so you don’t think that I have anything positive to say about this product, I do like that it looks cool and is affordable. I just wished it worked as well as I hoped.",1542747879571,0,False
5.0,Solid protection for your phone.,"The Under Armour cell phone case, fits my sons 6s Plus like a glove. He likes the look – all black and rugged. I like the fact that there are ridges (or indentions) along the sides of the case which seem to help with gripping. Unlike the sleek/slippery design like those that tend to slip out of your hand but instead allows you to grip your device securely. I think this will definitely appeal to the average consumer. This case appears to be well made, durable and doesn’t seem to pick up dirt or fingerprints easily. In conclusion, for a small investment (under $40), Under Armour (with UA Protector grip) appears to have everything you need: durability and a ton of protection (even drop protection). Overall, this is a pretty decent phone case and I would recommend it.",1509857947443,2,False
4.0,A lot of bang for your buck.,"In my opinion, the LeEco-LeS3 is pretty sweet.<br />Let me explain my reasoning.<br />First, I view technology (i.e., laptops, cellphones, etc.) as a necessity. It is incorporated in every facet of our lives. And in terms of cellphones, I tend to stick with the android. I like their functionality, ease of use and simplicity. Simply stated, I need a phone for dummies. I will say that I have never owned an iPhone (an iPad and Nano, yes but not an iPhone), so my perspective will be strictly from that of an android user. So when offered this unlocked 32gb smartphone, I had high hopes that I would both like the phone and find some of these same features that I enjoy. Overall, I haven’t been disappointed.<br /><br />Things that I like:<br />1. The LeS3 is stylish and sleek. Looks great and feels great in the hand.<br />2. It has the traditional/typical smartphone features.<br />3. My carrier is TMobile, so this unlocked version worked well. All I had to do was change the size of my sim card (my previous phone was the LG stylo) and I was good to go.<br />4. Setting up my phone was pretty easy, with the exception of scanning the bar code. I never did figure out how to do that. I wasn’t able to perform that feature.<br />5. This phone came with: a charger, ear-buds, an adaptor and even a case (although it is just a clear plastic one, it was nice not to have to go out immediately and buy one). Knowing my phone had some protection right out the box was a plus.<br />6. This phone connects to my Bluetooth (a Jabra) better than my previous one. It automatically connects once I put it in my ear versus my previous phone that frequently disconnected.<br />7. The camera feature is decent. My pictures are crisp and clear.<br />8. The battery life is great. That of course might change as time goes on. But for now, running Words with Friends, Facebook etc, I use less than 25% of my battery life during the day.<br />9. This phone is affordable, especially if you compare it to some products on the market.<br /><br />Things that I am still not sure about:<br />1. The barcode scanning feature never worked. If that is an important feature, make it easier to use.<br />2. (MOST TROUBLING) This phone heats up. Of course I was able to download a super cleaner ap that cools the device, but I still don’t understand why it gets hot.<br />With all that being said, in terms of style, ease of set-up and features, I give this camera a 4, having deducted a star for the cons.",1484958575000,0,False

4.0,Decent.,"When I ordered my new phone (Nexus 4), I realized that I needed a cover and thought that I would give this one a try. Once adhered, I was able to Slip my Ballistic cover over it. It is smooth to the touch and makes swyping easy. It also protects my screen. My only complaint is that the corners (top right and bottom left) have started lifting slightly. I think the reason that this is happening is because my case does not come all the way down which would hold the cover more securely. With the exception of this, this cover does exactly what it is suppose to do......it keeps fingerprints off the face of the phone and offers protections from getting scratches on your screen. I highly recommend the IQ Shield LiquidSkin as long as you are mindful of this when you are researching what kind of cover your intend to purchase.",1379905233000,1,True

1.0,Not really what I am use to in a Belkin product.,"I have purchased several Belkin products over the years. Traditionally they are a company that I have come to trust when purchasing accessories for various electronics. I have used Belkin products to secure my IPODs when working out, or even purchased the iWatchz Wrist Strap for my son's nano that he wears like a wrist watch. Regardless, when I saw that this was being offered, I thought that my son would enjoy having one to change up with from time to time depending on the occasion. Unfortunately, this was not the product that I should have ordered. Neither the quality or the look was what I have come to like about the Belkin brand. The nano attaches easily to the band, and while this product definitely looks boyish (i.e., masculine), it doesn't really look rugged or durable. I don't think that this particular style would appeal to ladies or even young girls. It isn't really cute and attractive. The band on-line or in photos looks a lot better than what it looked like in person. The picture was deceptive. While the picture makes the finished product look sleek and smart, it actually looks a little bulky and clunky. The band attaches by Velcro and to me doesn't really seem secure, especially if you are working out or running. If you hit the closure even a little bit, it loosens and doesn't remain secure.<br /><br />Was this product affordable? Not really. For the price, I think you can find something a little more affordable, practical and definitely more attractive. Paying a little more for something that will last a little longer and that you will be happier with, would probably be worth it.<br /><br />Attractiveness - 1<br />Price- 1<br />Durable - 1",1353991366000,0,False

5.0,Great quality phone stand! Please read my review fully though.,"At first, I was prepared to receive a low quality phone stand because of the price, which was around $10. I originally thought that maybe it would’ve been a hard plastic type, but I couldn’t have been more wrong. The moment I opened up the package, I was at an awe. I absolutely love mine! I was very impressed with the quality of this product. It’s all metal and very sturdy. I use this all of the time. It is difficult to move when adjusting, but it’s a good difficult because when you position it to the angle you want, it stays in its place until you physically move it again. You can easily type on your phone without the phone budging. I bought this in Rose Gold to match the color of my iPhone 7 Plus. There was one thing that I noticed that could be improved. I ended up purchasing a small piece of rubber from a craft store and I cut th piece to the size of the bottom (just a little less on all sides so that the rubber doesn’t hang off the sides and to collect debris. Anyway, I glued it on the bottom of the stand so that I could also do Facebook Live videos and still be able to type comments without the stand sliding on desks, counter tops or any other smooth surfaces. It also helps in the kitchen while you’re working on dinner and on Allrecipes and only have one free “clean” finger so that you can scroll down the ingredients to the recipe without the stand moving. It’s a very easy and inexpensive fix and now I have the stand that I’ve always wanted and have been using now for a little over 5 months. I will be ordering other ones soon and add my little “fix” unless the sellers decide to add it LOL and possibly sending them out as gifts to other family members and friends. Anyway, I would definitely recommend this product and I hope this review helps others.",1525321404209,0,False

2.0,Temporary solution,I had this phone case for three weeks before it completely snapped. The plastic was very cheap and didn't do much for protection. If you're looking to save you're looking to use this as a long-term phone case then it might not be the product for you. This phone case is definitely a short-term solution for someone who is looking to get something more durable.,1662249171071,0,True

3.0,You get what you pay for.,"The design of the case is amazing, it’s a very smooth design, as in, your hand is very accepting towards holding you phone with this case.<br />It definitely does make your phone a little bit chunkier! But it’s not too bad!! (Unless you have really small hands)<br />The stand in the case isn’t that great, it’ll keep your phone up, but at an angle  to where sometimes it’s not even worth having the stand.<br />All the button covers are perfect!!! They do their job and there is no complaints about those!!<br />The vibrate switch on your phone is definitely something you have to play around with to get it switch on or off. Not hard to reach but can be an obstacle to move on and off with the case.<br />Now, DURABILITY, I can definitely tell you that this case can take some hits to the ground from maybe 3 to 4 feet. The only probable is that it’s only good sometimes for one or two hits then it’ll break either all at once or piece by piece. Mine lasted me for about 2 weeks at max. It’s definitely a good buy for something temporary when you don’t have the money to buy a really good case!!  I’d say worth a try!! Maybe you’ll have a different experience! But only if you acknowledge that this case may be something temporary as in no more than a month!  You get what you pay For.  I was content for the most part. Just not the durability which is why I gave it 3 stars.",1570572484323,4,True

The protective glass cover that it came with was also cracked in the corners.(-1 star for durability.)<br /><br />Overall this is such a good idea for those that can’t have their phones charged for awhile.

Latched good to the watch.<br /><br />Cons: All are sports bands, They tear pretty easily (Too many holes in the bands to catch on things.) So not as durable as they should be.<br /><br />These are a different kind of plastic than what Apple uses. With too much use they break.

At first I slid it into the middle of the vent but the weight made the vent close and the mount point downwards, so I moved it to the very bottom vent slat and it worked great.<br /><br />I put the magnetic piece between my phone and the phone case - the case is a fairly thick rubber, so I didn't think it would stay in place.

5.0,It is surprisingly sturdy. They send a round and very flat metal ...,"This product really holds the phone very firmly in its place. There is absolutely no wobble and still holds perfectly over bumpy roads. It is surprisingly sturdy. They send a round, flat metal plate for the back of the phone with strong adhesive on one side. This item is well designed since it doesn't stick out in your pocket when you decide to carry it. it will stick to the back of just about any type of phone casing. There is also another rectangular metal plate with no adhesive on it. I've never had to use this but i guess its built for a larger phone and tablet so that it can be inserted between the phone and its case. I think this item also needs to have an adhesive on one side or it isn't very useful really.<br />I've compared a lot of different magnetic phone mounts and this beats other similar items out there, simply because it does the exact same thing as others, if not better and for a better price.",1423179993000,0,True
4.0,The steps for installations are provided which are pretty simple and it is in fact easy to install,"The steps for installations are provided which are pretty simple and it is in fact easy to install. They provide all the tools necessary for this. Any bubbles that formed were pushed away with just my thumbs, which by the way worked better than the slider. After having aligned and installed the protector perfectly, i noticed that the width on one side is about 1/2 mm short. It is not a problem at all, but i notice it when i turn the phone off and lay it down. They do sell an edge to edge protector it seems. However, that is twice the price, and i'd recommend this one over any. The reason being simple.<br />If you think about it, most of us probably trade phones in about a year or two, which isn't a long time. The screen will still stay in a pretty great shape with this on and you'll probably add a case to the phone anyway. Therefore, in my opinion this is a more reasonable purchase. Some of the more cheaper ones can be a hit or miss. If it is a ballistic glass protector with great clarity you want, this is the one i'd recommend.",1422074431000,0,True
5.0,Now this is a great case. The reason i got this is because ...,"Now this is a great case. The reason i got this is because it is not only very aesthetically pleasing to look at in person but it has a great feel as well. It is faux carbon fiber and the sides are not metal, but this is perfect for me because during warm or especially cold months here, real metal would have retained all the heat/ cold which can be really unpleasant to the touch. It would also have transferred the heat to the phone itself. For once going cheaper actually was a better decision. Also for its level of design and its perfect architecture/ fit at this price, it gets my vote as one of the best cases out there.<br />Only thing i would like to point out is that the white backside can pick up stains over time giving it a slight discoloration. It is soft to touch like rubber, so hopefully it stays just as beautiful as it came for a while. I am thinking of applying some protective coating on the back so that it repels dirt.

5.0,Worked great.,"This product was packaged safely and appeared brand new as if I had ordered it from the manufacturer, covered in temporary plastic peel off protectors on the screen and sides of the bezel. It looks just the way you would expect a brand new phone to look. The heatsink pads on the front assembly also have little plastic films on them so they are fresh right when you drop the motherboard down onto it.<br /><br />Installation of this product took an hour or so with the help of a video. I'm used to assembling PCs and doing laptop repairs but this was my first phone repair. Reassembly was simple enough and /most/ of the disassembly was straightforward, but there are a couple things you might want to consider when you take apart the phone.<br /><br />While I was able to take all of the components out and reinstall them in the new display assembly in working order, it seems very easy to accidentally mangle the flexible USB PCB when prying it off of the adhesive on the assembly because it was really rough (a couple people suggested using a hairdrier(?) to loosen the adhesive). The adhesive must also be reused because the display assembly does not come with new adhesive which came off alright for me but it seemed really easy to mess up (you may want to take a picture of the adhesive positioning before peeling it off the assembly). The power button and vibrating motor device was also easy to mangle and it was definitely a challenge with the tools I had.<br /><br />Tools required IMO: hemostats or small needle nose pliers, a metal spudger, a precise narrow plastic spudger, and something flat and plastic to pry up with (my plastic spudger worked)<br /><br />I really recommend making sure you have a good tool for each part of the disassembly, so make sure you watch a video on it and not just a teardown so that you know what you're getting into and order what you need.",1390206725000,1,True

5.0,Be careful putting it on....,"I the end, I gave 5 stars because of good customer service. I initially had trouble finding a case that I liked and that seemed worth the money for my new S21 5G. There just weren't a lot of choices. Then I saw this one. I like this color - not too flashy, but something different besides plain black or white. The price was pretty good, so I figured it was no huge loss if I changed to another later.<br />It was a bit difficult to put on. Like many more durable cases, it has the inner hard plastic shell and a second outer layer that is softer and more grippable. The inner hard plastic shell broke at the top when I was trying to put it on. I still managed to put it on and the outer shell held it all together pretty well despite the break. I was still a little annoyed, so I messaged the company telling them that it broke while I was trying to put it on - and they promptly sent me a brand new one, no return required, no hassle at all.<br />All in all, pretty pleased. I would say to be careful when putting the case on. But once it's on, it feels quite sturdy. It has the ""lip"" to keep your screen from smashing into the ground if you drop it, too. My popsocket sticks to it fine. All the button markers and holes are in the right place. And the customer service is top notch. It's not an expensive case like otterbox, but the feel of the case reminds me of otterbox cases I had on previous phones. I was rather surprised at how sturdy it felt once on my phone, especially given the price.<br />So.<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Cheap price<br />* Looks good<br />* Feels very sturdy with the inner and outer layers<br />* ""Lip"" to keep screen from getting smashed if you drop your phone on a flat surface<br />* Great customer service if you have a problem<br /><br />Cons:<br />* A little bit of a struggle to get on for me<br />* The hard plastic inner shell will snap at a thin part if not careful when applying force, but the company seems to replace for free with no hassle if this happens.",1617113694172,1,True

I won't be making that expensive mistake again! Now I clean it out regularly with canned air, but it's a chore and annoying to have to do so frequently.....enter these dust filters. They won't catch fine particles (if it was any more tightly woven to catch them, airflow would be an issue), but it catches bigger particles and dog hair/cat hair like a champ so far. If you have pets with lots of hair, these are a MUST!<br /><br />Super easy to install. There's no instructions but I'd hope you'd not need any. Literally just screw them in.

Just don't play hockey with it and you'll be good.<br />I have only used it a handful of times, but so far, so good.<br />I took it with me when I went camping for the weekend and would not have access to outlets besides car chargers - it worked beautifully to charge my smartphone, and pretty quickly. I did not recharge the power bank. 4 months later, it was still sitting there in my room. Then the power went out after a tree fell on a line - and it stayed out. My phone was about to die. But I need my internet! I whipped out the power bank, thinking it would be dead by now, or at least very little charge from having charged my phone twice while camping. Nope! It charged it full again and still indicated it had some power left in it.<br />The case is mostly plastic, but seems solid enough. You shouldn't be stomping on your power bank, anyway. Frankly, for the price, I'm pretty pleased. It has held up well. I actually DID step on my messenger bag one - which the bank was in - stepped right on the bank in the bag.

4.0,"Protector is solid strong, However…","This protector case is pretty solid and it seems it would definitely protect the Apple Watch Ultra. It’s thick and durable. What I do not like is that the touch screen protector that is part of it makes it difficult to touch the buttons.  For example: Passcode. You have to press down really hard and hold it down so the numbers will take. If you don’t hold it down, the number pressed will disappear.  It’s very annoying.<br /><br />Installation<br /><br />I followed the directions but it’s not that simple.  It states to insert crown side first and not to press down using the screen protector, to use the sides of it. That didn’t work for me. I continued to insert crown side first and slowly try to align the left side of the watch. It doesn’t go on easily.  I had to use the tip of my finger and carefully lift the left side of protector away from watch and use my other hand to press down. That popped on really fast.  It scared me with the actual screen. No damage, thank god.<br /><br />In summary, the protector is very strong and durable. I do not like the difficulty of trying to press buttons.

There are much better magnetic phone grips/rings out there, like the Anker magnetic ring, which is relatively strong and I love them! Yes, them. I bought one for my Apple phone and another for my Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra. Anyways, I suggest not wasting your money on this thing. If your looking for a  magnetic ring-type, which is great as a phone stand, go for Anker!",1662492687507,2,True
5.0,Definitely Charges Phones,"I use to use the portable Anker battery chargers to charge my phones. Now that wireless charging is popular, this device does a good job connecting, and staying connected, to wirelessly charge the phones. The magnet is strong. It charges the phone fast. And I love it’s a square little thing to carry around vs using a large portable charger.<br /><br />I used this mostly on my iPhone with Magsafe case until I finally decided to switch to the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra (yea, never thought I would leave Apple world). When it charged my iPhone, it was fast and didn't get warm at all. On my Samsung Galaxy (not very many true Magsafe cases yet), I purchased a case here on Amazon that has the magnets built into the cases. Side note: being that the Galaxy S22 series is relatively new, I am hoping better, true MagSafe cases will surface. I pray manufacturers who make the same Apple cases will also make them for Android that has the wireless charging capability.  Anyways, I used this charger with a case that has the magnets built into it. After about 15-20 mins, the phone case is very warm. I didn’t like that, so I avoid using this device on my Galaxy (I kept my Apple phone due to Dexcom G6 and Insulin pump. Why I changed makers? Wanted something different.). I could try to charge without the case, and I probably should now that I think about it, and will at another time (will update later), but it is a pain in the butt to keep taking the phone out of the case.  I bought 2 different magnetic cases and stuck with the one I have now, I noticed that switching was causing my phone screen (Invishield Fusion) to start lifting around the edges. And we all know that brand is expensive!! I had to replace it - thank goodness for warranty!<br /><br />So in a nutshell, it works great with true MagSafe cases, but the cheap ones on the market right now do cause the phone to heat up. Fingers crossed that true MagSafe cases will be developed for non Apple phones!<br /><br />I do highly recommend this wireless battery charger.  It charges the phone fast, and also charges up just as fast too. You may be able to get a few phone charges out of it before having to give it some juice.<br /><br />Definitely a go for Apple MagSafe cases, but caution with other wireless charging cases. I hope this kinda helps. I will need to test this charger without a case at a later time. I know this doesn’t help at the moment, but I do love this charging gadget.",1662491407322,3,True

However, it ended up cracking all over the place and it’s been a few weeks or so since I have put it on. I ended up buying from another protector from a different company who also has rave reviews.  The clarity is on par with this screen protector, but hasn’t cracked yet.  Pulling this screen protector off was very tough.  I ended up using a kitchen scrapper to get underneath the protector to lift it off.  It was so bad that It broke  off into pieces.  The adhesion is great, but very short life span, and I never handle my iPhone badly. In fact, in all the years I have owned iPhones and purchased screen protectors, never in my life have I ever encounter this.  I do NOT recommend this product.<br /><br />Like many people, I have used different brands of screen protectors and this one is a huge winner!! I decided to replace my InvisiShield that was lifting.

3.0,Spectre Shield used for Fitbit Sense - Scratches Easily,"There is not much of a selection out there when it comes to protecting the screen on the Fitbit Sense.  The packaging, thorough directions, and ratings were what determined to give these screen protectors a try.  They are nothing like Zagg, unfortunately, and the material/screen protector wasnt that great. That whole thing about you get what you pay for, is true.<br /><br />Now, I love how the company provided a step-by-step video on how to apply the screen onto the device. They even talk you through regarding the bubbles under the screen protector and timeframes for it to cure.  I have to appreciate that as they went above and beyond for their customers by explaining everything in detail.<br /><br />I followed the directions for the application to the T.  Everything they mentioned happened (bubbles, dry time, etc.).  I went through two screen protectors, though.  The first one was easy to install. Did exactly what the company said about allowing it too dry if it was too wet and/or slippery.  It took about 15 mins to finally start sticking to the screen.  Once that happened, I used the little squeegee they provided to press out the bubbles.  But somewhere, somehow there were two scratches on the outer screen. I was shocked.  The screen protector looked horrible when the sun or lights hit it. My guess is that maybe I was using the squeegee a little too hard?  But I will say this: the  screen protector is a bit dense and squishy. And being wet probably did not help as well. In any case, I decided to re-do it and did not like how it felt once dried. I took it off.<br /><br />I gave the company 3 stars because they did everything right. Packaging looked great, QR code for their video tutorial, which was dead on when applying the screen protectors, and warranty (though I did not attempt). I have decided to try another brand to see how its looks and feels. If that does not work, and we are talking about limited screen protectors for Fitbit Sense watch, then I may come back to this brand out of desperation.  I know there are bumpers/covers that protect the Fitbit screen - I tried that, too. But it covers the sensors needed if you want to see an ECG.<br /><br />I will have to update this review very soon just to share the final outcome.<br /><br />I hope this review helps a little bit.",1604989051703,4,True
3.0,Great Stand but not for Apple Watch 4,I truly loved this little stand. It was convenient next to my bed on a bedside table. I should have read the description as it states that the watch holder was built for Apple Watches 1-3. The Apple 4 is slightly bigger and I thought as long as it made contact with the charger that all would be great. I was wrong. The watch wouldn’t stay in place to charge very well. So it’s my mistake but it was a great little station to use.,1564146559856,0,True
5.0,Perfecto Screen Protection,"Just wow! Total perfection with placing the screen onto the phone and NO bubbles at all. I am so glad that Spigen used molds to assist with placing the screen.  Easy -Peazy! I have tried to place an Invisashield and the bubbles never went away despite directions. This mold with the protector in it made it easy to 1. Fit your phone in 2. Follow the direction sticker (step 2) to press it down and then 3. Remove the sticker and bam 💥! You are all set. The plastic on top of the screen protector lifts away from it and the 3rd directions which stated remove it, makes the entire process so easy. More companies should offer molds for all cell phones to aid in applying the screen protectors.",1564118042286,0,True
