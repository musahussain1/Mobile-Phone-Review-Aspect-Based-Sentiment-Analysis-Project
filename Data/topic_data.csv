5.0,gorgeous deep jewel tone purple with pretty design; functional secure wallet,"I pretty much only use wallet cases like these- more protection than just a holder. I had an expensive wallet case for my 3XL, and seems they don't have one yet for the 4XL. I needed something in the meantime, so I took a chance on ordering this case. I must say, the color is outstanding. It is a deep, gorgeous purple. On my end, darker than what is pictured. Clearly purple, but almost a black purple, if that makes sense. I also love the design on the front cover and magnetic closure tab. The rear is plain yet also attractive. The optional strap that comes with it seems sturdy enough. I have it attached though I don't often find myself using it. I like that I can take it off if I find it irksome.<br /><br />The interior has 3 slots for bank cards (or whatever) as well as a longer slot for paper money. As with every wallet case I have ever had, the opening isn't long enough to just slide money into. I always have to fold it. Not a problem as I usually just carry a little extra cash, and leave my wads of money (lol) for my actual wallet.<br /><br />The magnetic closure is sturdy and solid. It grabs the case and keeps it closed. Easy to open as needed.<br /><br />Built in kick stand is basically just allowing the phone to rest horizontally on the inside cover. It works.<br /><br />I am so impressed by the color that I want the other two colors as well, just to swap out.<br /><br />The cut-out around the rear camera is perfect. Zero issues. No haziness or other obstruction.<br /><br />If you are a fan of wallet style phone cases AND use it to hold bank card in the slots, then you should also get a screen protector. I say this because on my 3XL with another wallet case, the cards began to etch the screen. I don't think it is a matter of the brand of wallet or the quality, just the reality of a hard card hitting the screen over and over. So I made sure to buy a screen protector this time around. Now if there is any scratching, it will be on the protector and not the actual phone.<br /><br />For what it is worth, I like the wallet style not so much for the wallet part, but that it adds an extra level of protection that a non wallet/cover style case offers. I just prefer to have my phone covered from all sides. The interior of the case has the part that holds onto the phone, and it does so well. But I like the wallet aspect too. I tend to just go into the store with my phone rather than bring in a purse. So... No complaints!<br /><br />No complaints whatsoever. :)<br />If I have any, I iwll be back to update<br /><br />Truly, thanks for making a nice looking, budget friendly, functional case.",2019-11-12 19:41:16,0,True,gorgeous deep jewel tone purple pretty design functional secure wallet,pretty much use wallet case like protection holder expensive wallet case 3xl seems dont one yet 4xl needed something meantime took chance ordering case must say color outstanding deep gorgeous purple end darker pictured clearly purple almost black purple make sense also love design front cover magnetic closure tab rear plain yet also attractive optional strap come seems sturdy enough attached though dont often find using like take find irksomebr br interior 3 slot bank card whatever well longer slot paper money every wallet case ever opening isnt long enough slide money always fold problem usually carry little extra cash leave wad money lol actual walletbr br magnetic closure sturdy solid grab case keep closed easy open neededbr br built kick stand basically allowing phone rest horizontally inside cover worksbr br impressed color want two color well swap outbr br cutout around rear camera perfect zero issue haziness obstructionbr br fan wallet style phone case use hold bank card slot also get screen protector say 3xl another wallet case card began etch screen dont think matter brand wallet quality reality hard card hitting screen made sure buy screen protector time around scratching protector actual phonebr br worth like wallet style much wallet part add extra level protection non walletcover style case offer prefer phone covered side interior case part hold onto phone well like wallet aspect tend go store phone rather bring purse complaintsbr br complaint whatsoever br iwll back updatebr br truly thanks making nice looking budget friendly functional case,gorgeous deep jewel tone purple pretty design functional secure wallet pretty much use wallet case like protection holder expensive wallet case 3xl seems dont one yet 4xl needed something meantime took chance ordering case must say color outstanding deep gorgeous purple end darker pictured clearly purple almost black purple make sense also love design front cover magnetic closure tab rear plain yet also attractive optional strap come seems sturdy enough attached though dont often find using like take find irksomebr br interior 3 slot bank card whatever well longer slot paper money every wallet case ever opening isnt long enough slide money always fold problem usually carry little extra cash leave wad money lol actual walletbr br magnetic closure sturdy solid grab case keep closed easy open neededbr br built kick stand basically allowing phone rest horizontally inside cover worksbr br impressed color want two color well swap outbr br cutout around rear camera perfect zero issue haziness obstructionbr br fan wallet style phone case use hold bank card slot also get screen protector say 3xl another wallet case card began etch screen dont think matter brand wallet quality reality hard card hitting screen made sure buy screen protector time around scratching protector actual phonebr br worth like wallet style much wallet part add extra level protection non walletcover style case offer prefer phone covered side interior case part hold onto phone well like wallet aspect tend go store phone rather bring purse complaintsbr br complaint whatsoever br iwll back updatebr br truly thanks making nice looking budget friendly functional case,positive,2019,Phone Case

5.0,So pretty on my daughter's phone,"I bought her this case because, well, we didn't need to worry about screen protection since she's already dropped it and cracked up the screen.  I didn't notice when I ordered it (or when I came back to review it) that it came with a screen protector.  I put it away though because it would bubble.  If you saw her screen you'd known it would bubble.  No sense in even trying it.  Anyway, I'm getting off topic.  It looks really gorgeous on her phone.  I was surprised as well by the muticolored glitter.  We'd thought it was going to be all purple.  I'd also bought a popsocket with a blue purple and pink nebula on it (it was mine but she insisted, and, well, I admit she's kinda spoiled lol) and it's all matchy matchy.

5.0,AMAZING CELL PHONE BOOSTER SET for LARGE SIZED HOMES & YARDS!,"There are few things more frustrating than not having a cell phone signal at your home.  Currently many families have dropped their landlines and rely solely on their cell phones so maintaining a strong, dependable signal is more important than ever.<br /><br />I’ve had the opportunity to test and review a few different versions of the HiBoost cell phone signal boosters.  There are some differences between the systems but each of them work really well.  Depending on your specific requirements and area you need to cover, you should determine which set will best suit your needs.<br /><br />This review is specific to the HiBoost 10K Smart Link for coverage of 4,000 - 10,000 square feet.<br /><br />It is important to understand that these systems require INSTALLATION - IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU’LL JUST PLUG IN AND HAVE A BOOST IN YOUR SIGNAL.  That being said, I did not find installation overly difficult - although it did require a bit of time.  YOU WILL HAVE TO GET ON YOUR ROOF AND RUN WIRE.  If you are unwilling to do this, or hire someone to do it for you, this is not a product for you.<br /><br />In regards to this antenna booster set - it is absolutely professional grade.  While there are other “cell phone boosters” that attach to your phone but do nothing this utilizes an exterior antenna that relays the signal to the interior module which then boosts the signal prior to sending it to the interior antenna which provides the entire house (and yard) with a solid signal.  I am far from a cell phone signal expert - I followed the instructions and installed my set and my signal strength more than doubled.<br /><br />I used to have a few dead spots within my house which would drive me crazy - but those are gone.  While I used to have 1-2 bars within my house, I now have a solid 4-5 bars - and no dropped calls.  While it is still true that the farther you move from the interior antenna, or the more obstacles (walls) blocking the signal, the weaker the signal is that you receive, I found with this set, the signal is amplified to such a degree that the loss of signal didn’t hamper reception.<br /><br />This set is PERFECT if your cell signal is weak, or you have dead zones within your home or office, and you need to boost it so you can rely on your cell phone.  This will boost not only your ability to call without reception being lost but data will transfer more quickly and reliably over your cellular service.<br /><br />I can see how this set could be especially helpful for those who travel in an RV or camper.  It would only require hoisting the exterior antenna and fixing the direction in order to pick up the closest cell tower and then regardless of where you are located you will have cell phone reception.<br /><br />Something to note - the app is quite invasive with the information it requires and really does not do anything that can not be done using the LCD screen on the interior unit.  Personally I’m leery of foreign apps that require personal information in order to register them.  Due to the type of device that this is, I was not willing to risk the security breech on my network.  You’ll have to decide if it’s worth the risk for you.<br /><br />In my extensive testing I found that the effective range in real world conditions, such as within my home, through walls, is around 8,500 - 9,500 square feet.  This system boosted my signal not only within my house but also outside onto my decks and well into my yard.  The farther you move from the interior antenna the lesser the boosted signal but I still found a significant boost.<br /><br />I have tested and reviewed several similar products by this brand and others and this one, outperformed all the others.  All of the systems that actually work will have similar installation and set up procedures but in the end this set will provide you the reception that you want and need.<br /><br />This is a very solid, well built system that does what it claims.  While it will require a few hours to set up, I found it well worth the effort.  This is an excellent product that I definitely recommend.<br /><br />⭐️As with all Drew’s Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

3.0,I don't like the stick on screen protector,"I wish I hade read more on this before I ordered it for my wife. I bought one, a different brand, that I like a lot. It has a clear piece of plastic that covers the screen and protects it from scratches. I have not EVER liked the ones that you stick to the screen, like this one has. Good luck getting it on without a finger print or a speck of dust getting on it while installing it. Also, the rubber feels super cheap and flimsy compared to mine. The only reason I chose this one was because she wanted one in green, and the one I ordered didn't come in green. So I took a chance. For the cost, it's not a huge deal but my experience with those sticky screen protectors has been that eventually, they lose their stick and you get bubbles that are impossible to get rid of.

5.0,Works Better Than Bulky Cases,"I've always been a person who bought otterboxes and other bulky phone cases. If it didn't have a silicone/rubber layer and then a hard case, I never wanted it. I've had such bad experiences with clear cases before that I never believed it worked.<br /><br />But then in November 2020, I decided to upgrade my phone. I got a pretty color of the S20+ and it was a shame to hide it in the bulky case I bought. Especially since I don't travel as often as I used to. I decided to have 2 cases - One for going out (bulky) the other clear for when I'm at home.<br /><br />Needless to say this case has been on my phone since December 2020 and is still going strong. It has been dropped 5 ft onto tile and concrete. It flew from my car holder and slammed into the floor. I have literally dropped this so many times and I'm shocked it's not very scratched.<br /><br />I've had my old iphones break from simply from my pocket onto the ground when getting out of my chair in an otterbox!

2.0,This case is superior for protection but horrible for connectivity...,"I had a clear OtterBox case for a few months when the lower left corner tore apart. Even with the warranty OtterBox requires a $10 replacement and $2.99 shipping fee for a replacement case! I decided not to get the replacement that didn't last... That's a bad investment and I should have known better from a previous poor experience with an OtterBox case.<br /><br />I've had Supcase cases in the past and have never had problems with them. They are well made, fit my previous phones great and are military drop graded. This one was priced less than the OtterBox and had better features. It is built better than the OtterBox also- you can use either the front frames with a built-in screen protector or the one without it.<br /><br />The one with the screen protector has a cutout so that the fingerprint reader functions better (the guide asks that you register your fingerprint again after installing the phone in the case). I did and it works great... The screen protector also works fine for swyping.<br /><br />There is a kick stand on the back of the case for hands-free watching the screen in horizontal or vertical mode.<br /><br />Also included a rotating belt clip holster. When everything is attached it's heavy but I am fine with it. It feels secure and I have peace of mind the phone is well protected.<br /><br />I'll update this review in a few months.<br /><br />UPDATE - 01/06/23: Ever since I began using this case I noticed my phone having connectivity issues no matter if I was using WiFi or the T-Mobile network. After all these months thinking the SIM card might need replacing I went to the T-Mobile website for troubleshooting advice.<br /><br />One suggestion worked 100%- remove the case. As soon as I did that the connections were robust. The phone was so much faster now that it could receive a great signal- WiFi or only T-Mobile.<br /><br />As much as I love the case I'll have have to return it.",2022-10-13 00:25:23,10,True,case superior protection horrible connectivity,clear otterbox case month lower left corner tore apart even warranty otterbox requires 10 replacement 299 shipping fee replacement case decided get replacement didnt last thats bad investment known better previous poor experience otterbox casebr br ive supcase case past never problem well made fit previous phone great military drop graded one priced less otterbox better feature built better otterbox also use either front frame builtin screen protector one without itbr br one screen protector cutout fingerprint reader function better guide asks register fingerprint installing phone case work great screen protector also work fine swypingbr br kick stand back case handsfree watching screen horizontal vertical modebr br also included rotating belt clip holster everything attached heavy fine feel secure peace mind phone well protectedbr br ill update review monthsbr br update 010623 ever since began using case noticed phone connectivity issue matter using wifi tmobile network month thinking sim card might need replacing went tmobile website troubleshooting advicebr br one suggestion worked 100 remove case soon connection robust phone much faster could receive great signal wifi tmobilebr br much love case ill return,case superior protection horrible connectivity clear otterbox case month lower left corner tore apart even warranty otterbox requires 10 replacement 299 shipping fee replacement case decided get replacement didnt last thats bad investment known better previous poor experience otterbox casebr br ive supcase case past never problem well made fit previous phone great military drop graded one priced less otterbox better feature built better otterbox also use either front frame builtin screen protector one without itbr br one screen protector cutout fingerprint reader function better guide asks register fingerprint installing phone case work great screen protector also work fine swypingbr br kick stand back case handsfree watching screen horizontal vertical modebr br also included rotating belt clip holster everything attached heavy fine feel secure peace mind phone well protectedbr br ill update review monthsbr br update 010623 ever since began using case noticed phone connectivity issue matter using wifi tmobile network month thinking sim card might need replacing went tmobile website troubleshooting advicebr br one suggestion worked 100 remove case soon connection robust phone much faster could receive great signal wifi tmobilebr br much love case ill return,positive,2022,Phone Case

5.0,A slim iPhone 14 case with a silky feel and a built in ring/holder,"[[VIDEOID:66092c961c39bff86f0c9349a84e5066]] When it comes to phone protection, I strike a balance between bulkiness and protection.  I opt for a slim case to keep the phone small, then I add a tempered glass screen protector for the front and it generally protects my phone well enough.  Including protection from falls and scratches.<br /><br />Thomo Compatible with iPhone 14 Case is just the kind of case that I like.  It is slim at perhaps 1/8 inch thickness all around, made from silicone and lined with a soft felt so there's no danger of scratching the phone while taking it on/off.<br /><br />The silicone case itself has a silky texture that gives it a high-end feel and the color isn't well-represented in my pictures is a nice, dark maroon.<br /><br />Add to this, the built-in ring that I usually have to add to my phones to give me better grip so that there's even less chance for me to drop it.  Of course, the ring also serves as a kickstand for video watching.<br /><br />Now while most cases just come in a box, Thomo tried to set themselves apart by including a nice letter with little blurbs written by various people in their company.

5.0,Beautiful and secure case,A beautiful but functional case that adds little bulk to the phone while providing just enough security for accidental drops.

1.0,So disappointed,"I saw a couple of reviews stating the case doesn't make contact with the buttons on the Note10 but convinced myself those were isolated issues due to the number of positive reviews. Alas, actually no contact with volume buttons, making this very nice and very sturdy case useless. It's  too much of a pain to return this to a UPS Drop-off or Amazon locker in these days of virus so I will suck up the cost. I guess I'll try taking a knife to it to expose the phone's actual buttons. Shame, because I love the look of it and it feels good when it's on the phone. Looks like it would provide excellent protection.<br /><br />Edited to add that Frankenstein-ing the case didn't work. The hard interior shell sets the buttons too far away from the gel portion of the case to allow you to make contact. After examining the purchase I cut out, I'm still not sure why it doesn't makr contact. It appears to be lined up correctly and the depth of the rubber contacts seems correct. I can only assume the gel portion is just slightly enough distorted that it's preventing the contact to be effective.",2020-05-31 16:51:28,0,True,disappointed,saw couple review stating case doesnt make contact button note10 convinced isolated issue due number positive review ala actually contact volume button making nice sturdy case useless much pain return ups dropoff amazon locker day virus suck cost guess ill try taking knife expose phone actual button shame love look feel good phone look like would provide excellent protectionbr br edited add frankensteining case didnt work hard interior shell set button far away gel portion case allow make contact examining purchase cut im still sure doesnt makr contact appears lined correctly depth rubber contact seems correct assume gel portion slightly enough distorted preventing contact effective,disappointed saw couple review stating case doesnt make contact button note10 convinced isolated issue due number positive review ala actually contact volume button making nice sturdy case useless much pain return ups dropoff amazon locker day virus suck cost guess ill try taking knife expose phone actual button shame love look feel good phone look like would provide excellent protectionbr br edited add frankensteining case didnt work hard interior shell set button far away gel portion case allow make contact examining purchase cut im still sure doesnt makr contact appears lined correctly depth rubber contact seems correct assume gel portion slightly enough distorted preventing contact effective,positive,2020,Phone Case

4.0,Great Phone Stand for Large Phones,"I've been an OMOTON fan since the first stand I bought years ago (the pink stand). It's not an exaggeration when I say the experience of owning my first OMOTON stand was life changing. I previously had used acrylic and plastic phone stands, but they always tipped over. When they first released an adjustable one (silver stand), I fell more in love with the brand. The adjustable quality make video calling and video watching on my phone so much easier. My boyfriend recently got a large phone that's fairly thick with a case on it. I knew I wanted to buy him an OMOTON stand and was intrigued by this current model and thought it would work well for him.<br /><br />This model (black stand in the photo) sits lower than the previous model and is heavy duty enough to accommodate his phone without tipping over. His phone can fit into my silver stand, but the fact that the stand sits lower allows him to easily rest his phone without it tipping forward if he angles it too low. The one and only con I have with the current model (black stand) is that the hinge doesn't move as smoothly as the previous version I purchased for myself (silver stand). If I were to be extra picky, I would say the material because more light weight compared to the other models, but it doesn't affect the durability of the product. I highly recommend this model if you have a very large phone, but otherwise I would recommend the previous model (silver) for that smooth sliding hinge.",2019-02-03 06:12:55,19,True,great phone stand large phone,ive omoton fan since first stand bought year ago pink stand exaggeration say experience owning first omoton stand life changing previously used acrylic plastic phone stand always tipped first released adjustable one silver stand fell love brand adjustable quality make video calling video watching phone much easier boyfriend recently got large phone thats fairly thick case knew wanted buy omoton stand intrigued current model thought would work well himbr br model black stand photo sits lower previous model heavy duty enough accommodate phone without tipping phone fit silver stand fact stand sits lower allows easily rest phone without tipping forward angle low one con current model black stand hinge doesnt move smoothly previous version purchased silver stand extra picky would say material light weight compared model doesnt affect durability product highly recommend model large phone otherwise would recommend previous model silver smooth sliding hinge,great phone stand large phone ive omoton fan since first stand bought year ago pink stand exaggeration say experience owning first omoton stand life changing previously used acrylic plastic phone stand always tipped first released adjustable one silver stand fell love brand adjustable quality make video calling video watching phone much easier boyfriend recently got large phone thats fairly thick case knew wanted buy omoton stand intrigued current model thought would work well himbr br model black stand photo sits lower previous model heavy duty enough accommodate phone without tipping phone fit silver stand fact stand sits lower allows easily rest phone without tipping forward angle low one con current model black stand hinge doesnt move smoothly previous version purchased silver stand extra picky would say material light weight compared model doesnt affect durability product highly recommend model large phone otherwise would recommend previous model silver smooth sliding hinge,positive,2019,Phone Stand

4.0,Add Wireless Charging to Your iPhone 6/6s,"I am relatively new to the iPhone, having carried one for just about a year after my older phone died. My previous phone came with a special back that allowed for wireless charging, and I have sorely missed it. I was given the opportunity to test with this case for the iPhone 6/6s and it does work very well for wirelessly charging my iPhone. There are a couple of minor issues I have with it but these are not enough to discourage my use of this case.<br /><br />Charging cases in particular serve two purposes – protecting the phone and providing a mechanism for wireless charging. Wireless charging is an excellent feature – no wear and tear on the lightning cable and no fumbling with a cable that almost fits when there’s a good case on the phone.<br /><br />For wireless charging I will confess to having some initial disappointment that turned out to be not the fault of the case but the charger. With the phone in the case, I set the phone on the charger and it would start to charge and then stop. It did this repeatedly. I thought it was the case until I tried it with a larger, square charging pad and the case worked flawlessly and my phone charged up fairly quickly. Use this case with a larger wireless charging pad for consistent results.<br /><br />The case charges the phone by snapping to the back of the phone and there is a lightning insert to plug into the phone’s lightning port. When fully in place it looks good and the fit is tight – very tight. Getting the phone in the case is no issue, but taking it back out requires some finger strength. This is good and bad at the same time: it is good in that it will not pop off the phone and fit loosely, but it is bad if you want to take the case off for any reason. Plan on exerting some effort if you like to swap your phone case on occasion.<br /><br />In terms of phone protection this case provides basic corner and edge protection. The case frame is very hard and rigid and this is good for preventing corner dents which are more likely to shatter the screen. I would like to have seen more shock absorption in this case on the corners, though, which would add more damage protection for the phone without driving up the cost or interfering with operation. The case does not come with any kind of screen protection other than the bumper guard, so plan on buying a tempered glass screen protector to go with the case. To be fair, very few cases have screen protectors with them so this should not come as a surprise.<br /><br />The main feature of this case is that it can add wireless charging to your iPhone 6/6s, and it does this very well. I am pleased with the charging aspect and I will use this when I am in the office. For protecting the phone, it does an adequate job of corner and edge protection, though a little more shock absorption would be a welcome addition.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,This one's a keeper ...,"For some reason, I seem to collect charging cables.  I like having them near where I'm likely to need to charge my phone, so that means having one in nearly every room.  As such, I've purchased a number of different styles, sizes, and manufacturers.<br /><br />This Bolse cable just earned a place at the top of my list of favorites.  I love the look -- reminiscent of old cloth-covered power cords (anyone else old enough to remember those?), black with a bit of green.  The plug ends are both stainless -- NOT plastic -- a nice touch, that.  This cable is not going to break anytime soon.  I like the size, too -- 6' long.  AND it's Apple MFI Certified, so it plays well with my iPhone 5S.<br /><br />This is a cord meant for traveling, too.  It's relatively thin and very flexible, so it will roll up nicely for packing.<br /><br />Really, it has just about everything I look for in a charging cable:  length, quality at the plug ends, compatibility, and packability.

5.0,Someone finally got it right,"I've tried multiple devices to hold my phone in the car.  I've tried the ones that fit in the cup holder, the ones that have a goose neck that positions the phone at an odd angle, the ones that stick to your dashboard, and then I settled on an air vent holder that I got free at a trade show.  It didn't work very well, but I liked the concept so I started looking for others.<br />I found one that was ok, but it blocked the air vent and would occasionally fall off.  I looked at the reviews and features and liked the fact that it has a little hook to attach it to the vent and also it said that it didn't block the vent.  Well, I've heard that before so I didn't have much hope that I could use the air vent, but the hook seemed like a great addition so I ordered it.<br />I've been very happy, it stays on, it is not a hassle to take off if I want to and yes, it really does not block the flow of air from the vent.  It sticks out a bit, but that's why it doesn't block the vent  I also like the little button on the back that releases the phone.  You just put the phone in the device, and then push the sides in to hold it.  When you want to take it out, there is a button on the back which is easy to get to and it releases the side holders.<br />So, if you are looking for this kind of device, then I can highly recommend this one.

4.0,"Multi-used, functions well,  great product so far!","I wasn’t sure what to expect but this is a well designed multi-use charging station.  This is great for travel which I do often for work and pleasure.  It easily folds up and packs in a carry on bag or small backpack.<br /><br />Up front my two complaints.  Charging port is in the front and not in the back.  Should be one in back for charging or at least the side. Second there are no non-skid pads on the bottom. That is an oversight and should have been in the design.  It slides easily on smooth surfaces.<br /><br />So, the product came nicely package no flaws or functionality issues.  Once unpacked I read the direction and charged the station.<br /><br />Once charged, the station quickly charged my iPhone 12, ultra Watch and AirPods Pro’s at the same time.  My ultra watch has a cover on it but it’s the type that clips on…it’s the 4 Pack Smiling Case and Screen Protector.  Also, I just slide the loop around the bank to charge my watch instead of removing the band. I can’t comment on other style watch covers and if they will work with the charging pad. The battery bank itself also charged quickly.  I have charged and discharged the battery bank twice to charge all my items twice until the bank was dead.<br /><br />Overall, It is well build and designed.  Heavier than I expected but that is ok with me. The entire item is made of durable plastic.  The mag charger station for the phone works well and is strong.  The arm is not flimsy.  My only issues is why is the charging port for the battery bank in the front and no non-skid pads on the bottom to prevent it from sliding.<br /><br />Note, this will also be useful when outdoors such as hiking or camping.

5.0,Works with Google wireless charging and others,"--As soon as my husband and I each ordered us a Google Pixel 3 XL, we proceeded to search for a phone case cover. Independently we each thought the SnakeHive was the best contender of the bunch. I have used cheap phone cases in the past with success. This is not cheap, but it is still affordable for the quality. When selecting a phone case, it really comes down to what exactly you are looking for, and as for reviewing, if it met those needs.<br />--My husband wanted a folio style case as well as one that worked with the Google wireless charger. I wanted a folio style case, didn't care about the wireless charging, but definitely wanted 2-3 slots for my banking cards. He purchased the black, and I, wanting some color went with the Honey Gold.<br />--It is probably my computer, but I imagined the Honey to be more yellow. This isn't a negative, just wasn't quite what I thought. It is however, truly a Honey Gold (so the naming of the color is spot on). Reminds me of honey mustard sauce. --Soft, newbuck leather. It definitely has a soft feel, and as with any new leather, it will break in over time- both in flexibility and the surface patina. Real leather will absorb oils (from fingers) and absorb other elements of the environment. This is what gives the leather character. Expect your phone case to exhibit these changes over time.; especially a sheen around edges and magnetic clasp. Some people may decide on some additional leather care products.<br />--The stitching is solid and even.<br />--The magnetic clasp is strong, and accommodates additional thickness from use of card and money slots.<br />--3 horizontal card slots, with a full vertical opening to stash cash or receipts.<br />--Cut outs are perfect. The cut outs do not interfere with anything, including back facing camera (I had purchased a screen cover that while the cutouts were good, and the placement was perfect, it created a haze on the resulting picture. This case does not create that effect. It is well done!!)<br />--It doesn't have a special viewing stand, but due to slight fold in rear part of case, it acts as one simply by putting phone into horizontal position.<br />--This case WORKS with wireless charging units, both the Google Pixel wireless charging unit as well as some cheapies purchased on the side.<br />--I have yet to drop my phone, but so far it seems pretty secure in the case, including the rubberized phone holder - it feels secure, and meets up directly with surface of phone.<br />-- My husband does not care for the magnetic clasp. He has to be in and out of his phone many times throughout the day at work, and does not care to have to use two hands basically to get into it, without it feeling clunky. It can be done, but he found that he prefers the feel of a non clasp case, and has since found something else he likes (now I own a black case and my Honey gold case).<br />--I find that the security that the magnetic clasp adds to the safety of the phone (and bank cards, etc) is a great feature. For all the time I spend on my phone (which is a lot, as I definitely use social media and spend time writing reviews), I don't find it too intrusive. I have found it helpful at times when I have been in an odd position trying to get a selfie (usually when trying to get one with one of my dogs or cats), and have used the clasp as stability for my fingers. I guess this is preference thing.<br />In summation, I really see no complaints worthy of down rating this product. It appears to be as described, with the ability to protect the product and be functional. It works with wireless charger, which many of the cases for the Pixel 3 XL do not, or are far and few in between at time of searching for a phone case. Other aspects are simply a matter of preference.<br /><br />Edit 10/2019: Added pics of case that I just took. Also wanted to add that I have dropped phone many times, this case has kept my phone safe. Case color definitely deepens over time, great addition of character. It is a deep caramel brown now. If you use it to store credit cards in the slits, be sure to have a screen shield, or risk scratching phone screen. Other than that, it's holding up well!",2019-03-20 20:12:05,3,True,work google wireless charging others,soon husband ordered u google pixel 3 xl proceeded search phone case cover independently thought

5.0,Great party favors,"When I agreed to review these I expected a single review sample, but sometimes the universe works in strange ways because they arrived on the very day of a luau party. This synchronicity allowed me to see the smile factor these brought out in folks who received them as party favors.<br /><br />As a token gift they have a lot going for them: first, they are functional. But the cool thing is they are beautifully packaged and they are heavy (I am guessing that they are made from stamped stainless steel.)<br /><br />The 'thong' part of the flip-flop pulls out a little too easily, but I view that as part of a theme that can be dispensed with as soon as the opener itself winds up in the recipient's utensil drawer or glove box in their car.<br /><br />I gave these five stars because the smile factor is there. In fact, these seem to be more coveted than the decorative wine bottle stoppers that I gave out at a previous event. Of course I was delighted with the packaging and the weight, which gave the impression that I was giving out truly expensive party favors.

When I asked how to avoid doing this, they said buy a new phone. How disappointing!!! I would not recommend this phone for that reason, for not making calls (see above), for not being loud enough for voicemails, for saying that my contacts to call do not exist when they do, for calls not going through -they dial and hang up.

I also use several of the health tracking features (O2, pulse, and ECG) and fit is critical, especially for the O2 function.  So far, this band is working even better than my old silicone band as I can get just the right ""tightness"" for the monitor to work.  The O2 monitor is particularly finicky, and so far, it's working perfectly every time.<br /><br />The bands are colorful, and since I tend to wear black slacks with bright solid jewel-tine tops, they fit my wardrobe, too.  My only reservation on these is durability -- so far, I haven't noticed any problems, but I'm not certain they'll last more than a year or so.  Time will tell.  The cost isn't that great, so it's not a huge risk.<br /><br />Overall, I really like these.",2021-04-04 19:12:52,50,True,nice band fit series 6 40mm watch perfectly,decided change standardissue black silicone band something colorful found wrist tends run little large around 8 band fit figured elastic might good choicebr br adjustable im able get precise comfortable fit also use several health tracking feature o2 pulse ecg fit critical especially o2 function far band working even better old silicone band get right tightness monitor work o2 monitor particularly finicky far working perfectly every timebr br band colorful since tend wear black slack bright solid jeweltine top fit wardrobe reservation durability far havent noticed problem im certain theyll last year time tell cost isnt great huge riskbr br overall really like,nice band fit series 6 40mm watch perfectly decided change standardissue black silicone band something colorful found wrist tends run little large around 8 band fit figured elastic might good choicebr br adjustable im able get precise comfortable fit also use several health tracking feature o2 pulse ecg fit critical especially o2 function far band working even better old silicone band get right tightness monitor work o2 monitor particularly finicky far working perfectly every timebr br band colorful since tend wear black slack bright solid jeweltine top fit wardrobe reservation durability far havent noticed problem im certain theyll last year time tell cost isnt great huge riskbr br overall really like,positive,2021,Screen Protector

4.0,Not a fake review... simple and honest opinion,"Complaints about the shipment: Received the case on 9/24/2014 when the actual delivery date was 9/19. Seller did not notice me nor was updating the status. They emailed me after i contacted them about the shipment. I paid for 2 days of shipment to received the product 5 days after the promised date. I'm sure their shipment will be more stable/reliable later on, i'd give 0 star for their shipping.<br /><br />Product: So i put my iphone 6 plus in the case and it fits well. Material seems like nice. While they are not the expensive real leather, they feel soft/smooth. Magnet holder works well, both ways. After i put my phone and 4 cards the case gets a little fat but it still closes well. I've ordered the other brand with similar design(that one's suppose to be the best seller?) and with the same number of cards inside, it didn't close.

It's similar to a basic alligator clip. My old one was really awkward to put on. Another simple feature that I like is the storage bag. The only thing that would improve that would be for a hard case to store it in so it doesn't get crushed or broken.

The back appears made out of protective Crystal clear glass.. I’m loving that!! I love that you can see the actual iPhone for all its sleek and sexy lines- why buy an awesome looking phone and cover it up with bulk?!<br /><br />•The material used is 100% top grade. Trust me, I ordered two cases and the $7 alternative- looks like it..Cheap and foggy compared to this side by side. (Wish I could attach a photo to show extreme difference in material quality.) you just have to trust me on this one..<br /><br />•This had a barely bendable hardness to the case which I appreciate- a bit easier to put on the device without thinking something’s going to break.<br /><br />•Cutouts align as they should and yes!! You can use a wireless charging in this case, as long as you don’t use pop socket or ring attached to the back!!<br /><br />• Has the raised edge not only around front glass screen… But, also camera itself. Which, I feel is a must of you want to protect all THREE cameras.. um, yes please!!!<br /><br />• reinforced corners do not add any extra bulk to the case- making this barely sized bigger than the phone itself… But, giving the protection of bubble wrap-<br /><br />Hate to say it but, 2 accidental drops both, onto travertine tile from counter height… And not a scratch or crack on phone OR, case, totally shocked both drops!!

4.0,This charger comes with two coils and has a mount for a third.,"As declared in its listing title, this charger was made for Apple devices.  When used with Apple devices, there is one charging coil for the phone, another for the Airpods and there is a mounting hole to mount the charger for the Apple watch that can supposedly plug into the USB port on the side of the device.  As a bonus, it comes with a selfie light.<br /><br />This wireless charger comes with a wall adapter that can output 5V 3A, 9V 2A, or 12V 1.5A and is rated for Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0.  This means that by itself, the wall adapter can charge some hefty devices from tablets to phones but it is not as strong as the newer Type-C PD chargers.<br /><br />I'm not an Apple user so my experience is with an LG V40 and a pair of wireless earbuds that supports wireless charging.  What I found is that the 15W wireless charging can charge the phone very well, even though my phone's coils don't line up perfectly with the charger (again, the stand is designed for Apple phones).  It can also charge the earbuds to full with no issues.  It just can't do both at once.  Whether it's because the two coils are stealing amperage from each other or because the wall adapter isn't strong enough, I'm uncertain.<br /><br />With this experience, I believe that this charger probably can't charge three Apple devices together if the watch charger is plugged into the stand's USB port.<br /><br />Overall, I still like this charger because my earbuds generally don't need to be charged daily and the stand makes my phone easily accessible.",2021-03-28 05:28:43,0,False,charger come two coil mount third,declared listing title charger made apple device used apple device one charging coil phone another airpods mounting hole mount charger apple watch supposedly plug usb port side device bonus come selfie lightbr br wireless charger come wall adapter output 5v 3a 9v 2a 12v 15a rated qualcomm quick charge 30 mean wall adapter charge hefty device tablet phone strong newer typec pd chargersbr br im apple user experience lg v40 pair wireless earbuds support wireless charging found 15w wireless charging charge phone well even though phone coil dont line perfectly charger stand designed apple phone also charge earbuds full issue cant whether two coil stealing amperage wall adapter isnt strong enough im uncertainbr br experience believe charger probably cant charge three apple device together watch charger plugged stand usb portbr br overall still like charger earbuds generally dont need charged daily stand make phone easily accessible,charger come two coil mount third declared listing title charger made apple device used apple device one charging coil phone another airpods mounting hole mount charger apple watch supposedly plug usb port side device bonus come selfie lightbr br wireless charger come wall adapter output 5v 3a 9v 2a 12v 15a rated qualcomm quick charge 30 mean wall adapter charge hefty device tablet phone strong newer typec pd chargersbr br im apple user experience lg v40 pair wireless earbuds support wireless charging found 15w wireless charging charge phone well even though phone coil dont line perfectly charger stand designed apple phone also charge earbuds full issue cant whether two coil stealing amperage wall adapter isnt strong enough im uncertainbr br experience believe charger probably cant charge three apple device together watch charger plugged stand usb portbr br overall still like charger earbuds generally dont need charged daily stand make phone easily accessible,positive,2021,Phone Charger

5.0,Compact and Gets the Job Done,"Smartphones and iPhones are found in the pockets and purses of most every person in the USA. We need to stay connected and we need our phones powered and ready to go. When juice is needed and there is no electrical outlet nearby, you need a backup plan and that is what you get with this SAFUEL Portable Charger.<br /><br />Straight from the package, this power bank already had about 80 percent charge available, so there was no need to plug it in, but I did so anyway, just to see how quickly it would get to the 100 percent mark. It took only about 30 minutes to add those other 20 percentage points of charge, which is a pretty good rate of charge overall. And for charging your phone, it uses about 35 percent of its power to charge my phone all the way, from zero to 100 percent, which again is good.<br /><br />I love having a digital readout on a phone charger because I know precisely how much juice remains. This power bank is cool for another reason: It has a pull- out stand, on which you can place your phone while it charges, for easy viewing.<br /><br />This charger is smaller than most others but don’t let the size fool you.

5.0,Great if you need a central charger,"I'm almost ashamed to admit that I can consume the entire ten ports in this charger. Do be aware that while the charger itself is not particularly large (see the product specs for the dimensions), the amount of space taken up by phones, tablets and various devices is significant. My new charging area in which the review sample that I received is the centerpiece, is 4x2 feet and cable management is also a necessity. I am mentioning this because while this is a godsend for we gadget junkies, there are factors that you need to consider and space is at the top of the list.<br /><br />Since others have done a good job of reciting specs I'll avoid adding to that. There are some things that I love about this charger, and some things that you need to know.<br /><br />First, to set expectations, if you fully load this charger expect no more than 1.2 Amps per port. I know that the description says up to 2.4 Amps per port, but at 60 Watts total there are only 12 Amps total capacity. That means that you can get the full 2.4 Amps per port, but for only five of the ports simultaneously. Since the controller detects charging requirements, loading all ten ports with high current devices will drop all of them down to 1.1 Amps each. So if you have five tablets and want to charge them at 2 Amps each you can support two additional 1 Amp devices. Or if you have five 2.4 Amp devices, that is the max you can charge at the highest claimed charging rate.<br /><br />The above numbers are not as bad as they seem. I have three tablets, two phones and a plethora of speakers and other devices and this charger handles that gaggle of electronics at their max charging rates. My main test is to determine the fastest rate for a single port. I use a Galaxy Note 3 with a 3300mAh internal battery and the best time it gets from another wall charger I use. On the other charger the Note 3 charges 1% per 2.5 minutes. On this charger - with no other devices plugged in - the Note 3 charges in 2.8 minutes, which is a 28 second difference. For me that is an excellent number because I have other chargers that claim to be fast that take from over three up to six minutes to charge the phone 1%.<br /><br />As others have mentioned this charger is both quiet and runs cool. I have no qualms about leaving it in another room charging my gadgets overnight. Contrast that with other multi-port chargers that I have tested that run very hot when fully loaded. I always worry about fire and safety issues with those, so the running parameters of this one are yet another reason why I awarded it five stars.",2014-10-21 09:01:34,0,False,great need central charger,im almost ashamed admit consume entire ten port charger aware charger particularly large see product spec dimension amount space taken phone tablet various device significant new charging area review sample received centerpiece 4x2 foot cable management also necessity mentioning godsend gadget junky factor need consider space top listbr br since others done good job reciting spec ill avoid adding thing love charger thing need knowbr br first set expectation fully load charger expect 12 amp per port know description say 24 amp per port 60 watt total 12 amp total capacity mean get full 24 amp per port five port simultaneously since controller detects charging requirement loading ten port high current device drop 11 amp five tablet want charge 2 amp support two additional 1 amp device five 24 amp device max charge highest claimed charging ratebr br number bad seem three tablet two phone plethora speaker device charger handle gaggle electronics max charging rate main test determine fastest rate single port use galaxy note 3 3300mah internal battery best time get another wall charger use charger note 3 charge 1 per 25 minute charger device plugged note 3 charge 28 minute 28 second difference excellent number charger claim fast take three six minute charge phone 1br br others mentioned charger quiet run cool qualm leaving another room charging gadget overnight contrast multiport charger tested run hot fully loaded always worry fire safety issue running parameter one yet another reason awarded five star,great need central charger im almost ashamed admit consume entire ten port charger aware charger particularly large see product spec dimension amount space taken phone tablet various device significant new charging area review sample received centerpiece 4x2 foot cable management also necessity mentioning godsend gadget junky factor need consider space top listbr br since others done good job reciting spec ill avoid adding thing love charger thing need knowbr br first set expectation fully load charger expect 12 amp per port know description say 24 amp per port 60 watt total 12 amp total capacity mean get full 24 amp per port five port simultaneously since controller detects charging requirement loading ten port high current device drop 11 amp five tablet want charge 2 amp support two additional 1 amp device five 24 amp device max charge highest claimed charging ratebr br number bad seem three tablet two phone plethora speaker device charger handle gaggle electronics max charging rate main test determine fastest rate single port use galaxy note 3 3300mah internal battery best time get another wall charger use charger note 3 charge 1 per 25 minute charger device plugged note 3 charge 28 minute 28 second difference excellent number charger claim fast take three six minute charge phone 1br br others mentioned charger quiet run cool qualm leaving another room charging gadget overnight contrast multiport charger tested run hot fully loaded always worry fire safety issue running parameter one yet another reason awarded five star,positive,2014,Phone Charger

5.0,Great Phone,"I received this phone for Christmas and after 23 days, I love it!  It's easy to use and I can make a call without having to take my glasses off.  Yes, I'm a bit far-sighted.  This is my first smart phone and I'm not all that interested in surfing or email, having a ton of apps, or even texting.  I use a phone for making and getting calls and so far this one has been perfect.<br /><br />The screen is bright, responsive and quick, the size, smaller than an iphone or galaxy, bigger than most non-smart phones is just right.  It's easy to see and hold yet isn't so big it doesn't fit well in a pocket.  The battery life is good. I haven't timed the battery life but it's good for at least 5 days on standby, probably more.  Talking on it is the best part.  It sounds great.

2.0,Meh,"Despite what others have said, I am NOT loving this more than my pop socket. I've been trying to adjust for the last three weeks. I think it comes down to how you naturally hold your phone while using it.  I gave small hands, and what I have since realized is that I don't hang onto my phone with my fingers or an actual grip. Rather i hang onto the popsocket between my two fingers, my grip is ""open"" the phone rests on my fingers, leaving my thumb free to move anywhere.  With this ring, I've been forced to go back to gripping the actual phone and now my mobility is limited.  I'm also finding I have to use two hands far more often with a ring grip (to type and surf.... as well as to open, close and spin the ring). I'm constantly having to adjust the ring to fit my grip, since I rotate my phone screen a lot.<br />I also don't get or understand the generic clear adhesive circle disk that you have to put down before attaching the 3m adhesive. It's huge under the ring, it's ugly, and is already starting to bubble up on the edges. And technically, the 3m adhesive isn't touching the case at all. Pretty sure the 3m was included simply as a selling point.<br />Don't get me wrong, pop sockets aren't perfect. Of the three I've had, the design rubbed off on all three and one popsocket broke off.  But never had a problem with the actual adhesive despite common complaints with them.  And I find it easier to use, since I don't have to consciously think about what position the ring is turned too.<br />The other thing I noticed is the metal ring is hard... The popsocket is more of a tough rubber. I kind of smirked at other reviews that complained about the hard metal not being a comfortable feeling.... But they were surprising correct.  Our fingers are very sensitive and the hard metal ring is uncomfortable in comparison.<br />The only aspect of the ring I like over the popsocket is when I'm actually NOT using the phone.  Carrying a ring looped onto one finger is more secure than a pop socket squeezed between two fingers.  I'm switching back to a pop.",2019-11-24 03:06:49,2,True,meh,despite others said loving pop socket ive trying adjust last three week think come naturally hold phone using gave small hand since realized dont hang onto phone finger actual grip rather hang onto popsocket two finger grip open phone rest finger leaving thumb free move anywhere ring ive forced go back gripping actual phone mobility limited im also finding use two hand far often ring grip type surf well open close spin ring im constantly adjust ring fit grip since rotate phone screen lotbr also dont get understand generic clear adhesive circle disk put attaching 3m adhesive huge ring ugly already starting bubble edge technically 3m adhesive isnt touching case pretty sure 3m included simply selling pointbr dont get wrong pop socket arent perfect three ive design rubbed three one popsocket broke never problem actual adhesive despite common complaint find easier use since dont consciously think position ring turned toobr thing noticed metal ring hard popsocket tough rubber kind smirked review complained hard metal comfortable feeling surprising correct finger sensitive hard metal ring uncomfortable comparisonbr aspect ring like popsocket im actually using phone carrying ring looped onto one finger secure pop socket squeezed two finger im switching back pop,meh despite others said loving pop socket ive trying adjust last three week think come naturally hold phone using gave small hand since realized dont hang onto phone finger actual grip rather hang onto popsocket two finger grip open phone rest finger leaving thumb free move anywhere ring ive forced go back gripping actual phone mobility limited im also finding use two hand far often ring grip type surf well open close spin ring im constantly adjust ring fit grip since rotate phone screen lotbr also dont get understand generic clear adhesive circle disk put attaching 3m adhesive huge ring ugly already starting bubble edge technically 3m adhesive isnt touching case pretty sure 3m included simply selling pointbr dont get wrong pop socket arent perfect three ive design rubbed three one popsocket broke never problem actual adhesive despite common complaint find easier use since dont consciously think position ring turned toobr thing noticed metal ring hard popsocket tough rubber kind smirked review complained hard metal comfortable feeling surprising correct finger sensitive hard metal ring uncomfortable comparisonbr aspect ring like popsocket im actually using phone carrying ring looped onto one finger secure pop socket squeezed two finger im switching back pop,positive,2019,Phone Holder
5.0,AWESOME!!!,"I have just started using my first OtterBox and I am astounded...It isn't water proof, but other than that it is the best phone case I've ever tried.  I scoffed at the price, but then I was given one and I am so sad that I didn't try it sooner.<br /><br />First, the bad:  The instructions are terrible...I'm talking VCR-instruction-manual-in-the-70s bad!  But after a few minutes of playing with it (during which I could have broken it so be careful) I figured out how get the darn thing open and closed back up around my phone.  I removed my screen protector, which had become old and spotty, and wiped the screen well.  Now the spots are gone and the protection is kicked up several notches!<br /><br />Now the good:  Well built, solid, buttons are easy to press thanks to rubber gaskets which they thought to add so that nothing is out of reach.<br /><br />Covers over two ports look annoying, but I think I can cut them off if I don't like them.<br /><br />Overall, 5 stars and I'll never buy another case of a large screen phone again!",2014-01-22 14:52:34,0,False,awesome,started using first otterbox astoundedit isnt water proof best phone case ive ever tried scoffed price given one sad didnt try soonerbr br first bad instruction terribleim talking vcrinstructionmanualinthe70s bad minute playing could broken careful figured get darn thing open closed back around phone removed screen protector become old spotty wiped screen well spot gone protection kicked several notchesbr br good well built solid button easy press thanks rubber gasket thought add nothing reachbr br cover two port look annoying think cut dont like thembr br overall 5 star ill never buy another case large screen phone,awesome started using first otterbox astoundedit isnt water proof best phone case ive ever tried scoffed price given one sad didnt try soonerbr br first bad instruction terribleim talking vcrinstructionmanualinthe70s bad minute playing could broken careful figured get darn thing open closed back around phone removed screen protector become old spotty wiped screen well spot gone protection kicked several notchesbr br good well built solid button easy press thanks rubber gasket thought add nothing reachbr br cover two port look annoying think cut dont like thembr br overall 5 star ill never buy another case large screen phone,positive,2014,Phone Case
4.0,Good for Daytime Use,"I have played with several dash cams and they all tend to work about the same. They are useful for recording events on the road provided you have enough storage in them and they usually have good daytime resolution. The differences are usually in the specific features/capabilities and in the extras in the box. They also can differ when it comes to night vision. This particular camera is good for daytime work, but it suffers at night time with poor imaging in low light situations.<br /><br />This is a nice-looking unit that is about 1/3 the size of my GPS navigator. It comes with the extras you need to get going right away – the suction cup, USB cable, car charger and the memory card. The product description is a little off: it says it comes with an 8GB card, but mine came with a 16GB Class 6 card.<br /><br />The camera has a couple of different modes for capturing images. It can capture HD video (which can be ratcheted down, of course) and it can capture still images. Both of these are useful modes depending on what you are trying to accomplish. Keep in mind that this is no substitute for a regular camera or video camera.<br /><br />I had no trouble mounting it on my windshield in the car and I was able to set it up to record. I particularly like the fact that it can record continuously instead of requiring short clips of fixed sizes (unless you want that). I set it to record continuously and went for a drive, recording the whole trip. The image was clear and bright, though the image was slightly distorted due to the wide-angle lens.<br /><br />Others have had some difficulty with night recording so I tried it after sunset too, and I understand the criticisms. It does not adjust well for night driving. When I upped the exposure enough to get images the colors got funny. So, apparently this camera is not well-suited for night recording though it can be made to work.<br /><br />The menu system is fairly straightforward and it is easy to adjust settings. I was able to tweak exposure levels, resolutions and more.<br /><br />I have noticed that the camera drains the battery faster than it can charge when plugged in. So, even when fully charged up and plugged in it will eventually cut off with a dead battery.<br /><br />This is a neat little dash cam and I like it. It does have a couple of small issues but there have been no deal breakers so far. This is a decent little dash cam that works well – in the daytime.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,"Clever Design, but may not work with S-Pen devices","I received a review sample and was thoroughly impressed with this mount for the following reasons:<br /><br />(1)It will adhere to irregular surfaces. I tested it on the dash of my car which has a textured surface to which all other suction-style mechanisms failed to adhere. This one not only held, but did not budge holding my Galaxy Note 3 phone. That device is nearly the size of a tablet, so if it can hold that it will pretty much hold any other phone currently on the market.<br /><br />(2) The magnet mechanism is slick. It does not limit you to a particular size of phone. No grab arms with their inherent limitations. There are four methods of using it, including affixing the magnet directly to the back cover of your phone with the adhesive patch, or merely inserting it between your phone and a case holding your phone. For heavier cases this did not work for me. My [[ASIN:B00ESAGVLK Bear Motion for Galaxy Note 3 Genuine Lambskin Folio Case]] added too much weight for the magnet to hold, but it's a very heavy case to start with.

5.0,"Works as advertised, easy to install, No dust!","I needed to protect my Blackberry Curve after having dropped it AGAIN and this time out at the barn where one of the horses missed stepping on it by a whisker. A Percheron hoof would be the death knell for this pretty and functional, but let's face it, delicate phone. So.... the Otterbox is not so pretty. I had to give up the lovely red sleek Blackberry style for what is essentially a black rubber encased box. But... it actually doesn't look that bad and it still slips right in my pants pocket wtihout a huge unsightly bulge.<br /><br />The plastic cover was easy to install bubble free with a credit card and a little patience - only took two tries. The instructions were clearly written. The rest of the case and rubber outer cover installed in seconds and everything fit exactly. The keys and trackball are perfectly useable through the plastic cover just as they were without it. The only caveat is the clarity of the camera with the plastic installed - you do need to cut out the plastic bubble over your camera eye if you still intend to take clear photos with the Otterbox in place.<br /><br />I had the phone out at the barn again after installing the Otterbox and there is NO dust or dog/horse hair or hay under it or on the screen AT ALL and that is a first. The Body Glove case I had before had to be removed and the phone had to be cleaned every time I took the phone with me to do horse stuff.",2009-04-02 15:05:09,0,True,work advertised easy install dust,needed protect blackberry curve dropped time barn one horse missed stepping whisker percheron hoof would death knell pretty functional let face delicate phone otterbox pretty give lovely red sleek blackberry style essentially black rubber encased box actually doesnt look bad still slip right pant pocket wtihout huge unsightly bulgebr br plastic cover easy install bubble free credit card little patience took two try instruction clearly written rest case rubber outer cover installed second everything fit exactly key trackball perfectly useable plastic cover without caveat clarity camera plastic installed need cut plastic bubble camera eye still intend take clear photo otterbox placebr br phone barn installing otterbox dust doghorse hair hay screen first body glove case removed phone cleaned every time took phone horse stuff,work advertised easy install dust needed protect blackberry curve dropped time barn one horse missed stepping whisker percheron hoof would death knell pretty functional let face delicate phone otterbox pretty give lovely red sleek blackberry style essentially black rubber encased box actually doesnt look bad still slip right pant pocket wtihout huge unsightly bulgebr br plastic cover easy install bubble free credit card little patience took two try instruction clearly written rest case rubber outer cover installed second everything fit exactly key trackball perfectly useable plastic cover without caveat clarity camera plastic installed need cut plastic bubble camera eye still intend take clear photo otterbox placebr br phone barn installing otterbox dust doghorse hair hay screen first body glove case removed phone cleaned every time took phone horse stuff,positive,2009,Phone Case

1.0,Not a good fit for most phone cases.,"It's hit or miss with them and it all depends on the type of case that you're using. These full-screen tempered glass cases are not compatible with 90% of the cases out there. I bought my 2nd iloome screen protector (white) for my iPhone 6 because my last case (elago S6 Duro Case) ruined the first screen protector b/c the fit was too tight. So I bought the Apple leather iPhone case, thinking that the low profile and slim fit would be compatible with the iloome. Well, I was wrong... it did not fit towards the bottom and the more I used the phone, the more the screen protector started coming up from the screen of the phone. Over the weekend, I ran a 5-mile road race with the phone in my pocket and even though the phone was protected from the rain, the cover peeled up and got condensation in the phone and ruined my screen.<br /><br />Overall, these screen protectors are good, but just be careful with the case that you're using with it.

5.0,Very strudy and holds a Note 4,"I received this as a free review sample eight months ago. It is not permanently mounted in my vehicle, but I do use it when I and driving to unfamiliar places and want my phone's GPS display within visual contact - especially the last mile.<br /><br />Overall this is slightly more than ten inches long, with the gooseneck measuring in at seven inches. I can tilt the clip up to forty-five degrees, which is more than enough for my purposes. I mount mine on my windshield, so the 360 degree rotation capability is not important to me. I suppose if you are mounting this on a dash and sharing back and forth with a passenger that would be a nice feature.<br /><br />The clamp is quick and easy. I like it more than the spring loaded arms that some mounts use because I can accommodate my Note 4 phone and the flap case without having to remove the case.<br /><br />Another thing I like is the gooseneck holds the Note 4 in its case fairly steady. If I get into maniac driving mode taking fast, sharp turns it understandable moves around. When I am driving carefully it stays in place.

It also seems to protect it pretty well also as it doesn't stick out of the case and if it were to fall the case would cushion the fall. The only thing with this case is that it does stand up and that's great but the tab that keeps the case shut gets in the way and doesn't want to flip back or anything so it does make it a bit of a pain to hold it back when you want to watch something.

4.0,Nice magnetic phone holder with unique ball joints on both ends...,"THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* Strong magnetism. I believe neodymium magnets are inside this holder.<br />* Ball joint articulation on both ends of the holder. This is a unique design. Most holders only feature articulation on one end.<br />* Ball joint movement is nice and rigid. You don't want it loose. You want to be able to maneuver it, but you also want it to hold the weight of your phone without budging. So this gets the job done.<br />* Three metal plates are included for you to adhere to cases, or surfaces that are not metal.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Surprising lightweight. I was expecting something heavy duty. The main round ends that houses the magnets seem to be chrome plated plastic. If it's not plastic, it's very lightweight aluminum. Nowhere in the listing does it describe what it's made of either, so I dunno.

5.0,Charges New iPad Very Fast (Needs Lightning to USB-C Cable),"This ESR USB-C 18W FAST WALL CHARGER WITH PD (UL Certified, with Foldable Prong) charges my new iPad Air (3rd Gen) very fast--much, much faster than the Apple 12W USB Charger that came with it.<br /><br />PD means “Power Delivery”.  USB PD is a new power standard that can be used across multiple devices, so that you don’t need a lot of different adapters.  PD increases power levels--up to 100W--so that devices charge faster.  PD determines how much power each device needs, and ensures that each device is NOT overcharged.  This ESR USB charger delivers 18W of power.<br /><br />PD chargers have USB-C ports, so you will need a cable with a USB-C plug (rather than the familiar flat USB plug) to connect your iPad, cellphone, etc.  My iPad uses a lightning cable, so I ordered this [[ASIN:B07CMN7DCX Apple Lightning to USB-C cable]].  It’s a genuine Apple cable that arrives new in a sealed Apple box, so I know it’s safe to use with the iPad.<br /><br />Until I got the settings on the new iPad adjusted to eliminate battery-draining default features, I was actually having to curtail my iPad use.  The iPad was discharging rapidly, and the recharging with the ordinary USB adapter was taking forever.  This 18W PD adapter solved the problem completely.  The iPad recharges quickly even when it’s connected to my home wireless network and I’m using it.",2019-12-28 15:43:16,0,False,charge new ipad fast need lightning usbc cable,esr usbc 18w fast wall charger pd ul certified foldable prong charge new ipad air 3rd gen fastmuch much faster apple 12w usb charger came itbr br pd mean power delivery usb pd new power standard used across multiple device dont need lot different adapter pd increase power levelsup 100wso device charge faster pd determines much power device need ensures device overcharged esr usb charger delivers 18w powerbr br pd charger usbc port need cable usbc plug rather familiar flat usb plug connect ipad cellphone etc ipad us lightning cable ordered asinb07cmn7dcx apple lightning usbc cable genuine apple cable arrives new sealed apple box know safe use ipadbr br got setting new ipad adjusted eliminate batterydraining default feature actually curtail ipad use ipad discharging rapidly recharging ordinary usb adapter taking forever 18w pd adapter solved problem completely ipad recharges quickly even connected home wireless network im using,charge new ipad fast need lightning usbc cable esr usbc 18w fast wall charger pd ul certified foldable prong charge new ipad air 3rd gen fastmuch much faster apple 12w usb charger came itbr br pd mean power delivery usb pd new power standard used across multiple device dont need lot different adapter pd increase power levelsup 100wso device charge faster pd determines much power device need ensures device overcharged esr usb charger delivers 18w powerbr br pd charger usbc port need cable usbc plug rather familiar flat usb plug connect ipad cellphone etc ipad us lightning cable ordered asinb07cmn7dcx apple lightning usbc cable genuine apple cable arrives new sealed apple box know safe use ipadbr br got setting new ipad adjusted eliminate batterydraining default feature actually curtail ipad use ipad discharging rapidly recharging ordinary usb adapter taking forever 18w pd adapter solved problem completely ipad recharges quickly even connected home wireless network im using,positive,2019,Screen Protector
5.0,Very Cute!,"This phone case is so cute! First of all, it looks better in person. I ordered the wine colored one with a simple embossed flourish on the cover for my teenage daughter. There is a flexible plastic/rubber case that fits directly on your phone. Then that case has magnets in it that keep it attached to the faux leather folder/wristlet. There is a magnetic clasp that keeps the folder closed. There are 2 card slots as well as a pocket to slide bills into. That's plenty of room for a teen. You wouldn't want to put much more in there due to thickness. The whole thing would not stay closed as well.  The magnets on the back of the separate phone case are pretty strong. She was able to stick her phone on the refrigerator and it did not slip or fall. There are not a lot of reasons that you would want to put your phone there, but if you do, then know that it's strong enough to hold it there. This wallet style phone case is perfect for my daughter to use. She doesn't usually carry a purse with her, but she always takes her phone with her. Now she can store her student ID and a little bit of cash with her easily. The case does not interfere with charging or headphone ports.<br /><br />*I received this case for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

1.0,"Batteries move around inside, this is terrible...","[[VIDEOID:ee5b6db7622711a95d8e3ae598961ae]] THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* You get FOUR 18650 batteries that you may be able to use somewhere else. That's all that's good about this.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Base on the price tag, I knew something was up, but I didn't care. I just wanted the four batteries inside to serve as back-up to some of my light sabers, but they can't even serve that function because they're made shorter than the ones used in light sabers.<br />* The case is very cheap. Only 3.6 ounces without the batteries.<br />* The case is also difficult to open, you'll break it at some point down the line.<br />* The batteries loosely fit inside. Have you ever used a portable battery bank that jiggles or moves around inside? LOL! I haven't, and I'm not about to start.<br />* I had only put in two batteries when I saw the springs heat up RED. I guess I must have pushed the power button on the side by accident. I guess there is no built in safety measure where it doesn't turn on unless all batteries are installed, or compartment closed. Could have burned my fingers.<br />* Watch my video, this is a terrible product.<br /><br />If you read my reviews. I rarely give 1-Star ratings.

I chose the pink - which darker than shown in photos - more of a peptobismal type pink - because that color was in stock - others I would have preferred were out of stock.  It feels like a poured, solid form.  Has a little weight to it.  You could put it in your purse if you carry a pretty big purse.  It holds my phone either standing upright or on it's side.  The only thing I will note is that the base of the holder needs a little something to keep it from sliding around a bit.  It is a plastic of some sort - but it feels like a really dense rubber like substance (?) - not sure.  Was hoping it wouldn't slide around, but it does. I am thinking of gluing a little non skid material to the bottom.  On the flip side, if you want it to slide around, it does!  All in all, it's handy for my purpose.

5.0,Love This Phone!,First off I did my research and purchased during prime day and got very lucky as this phone A71 5G was discounted on the 2nd day. I love the speed of the 5G that I get with T-mobile. Blazing fast compared to 4LTE. 128GB memory which I forgot to purchase (my mistake not the seller's as it stated it wasn't included but this was my first time purchasing an unlocked smartphone).  Delivered ahead of schedule which was great. No scratches or blemishes on the phone at all. This is my 2nd renowned purchase and both were Samsung Galaxy products that were in like new condition.  I would definitely not hesitate to go this route again. Very satisfied.  I also went with the optional drop protection for the screen.  Company is great to work with and it is emailed to you. No issues with the phone so far. If I do I will update. This specific phone was locked to T-mobile which was not an issue for me as that is my carrier.  I would just make sure before purchasing you ck with your carrier to make sure it is compatible with them.,2022-08-28 20:47:50,0,False,love phone,first research purchased prime day got lucky phone a71 5g discounted 2nd day love speed 5g get tmobile blazing fast compared 4lte 128gb memory forgot purchase mistake seller stated wasnt included first time purchasing unlocked smartphone delivered ahead schedule great scratch blemish phone 2nd renowned purchase samsung galaxy product like new condition would definitely hesitate go route satisfied also went optional drop protection screen company great work emailed issue phone far update specific phone locked tmobile issue carrier would make sure purchasing ck carrier make sure compatible,love phone first research purchased prime day got lucky phone a71 5g discounted 2nd day love speed 5g get tmobile blazing fast compared 4lte 128gb memory forgot purchase mistake seller stated wasnt included first time purchasing unlocked smartphone delivered ahead schedule great scratch blemish phone 2nd renowned purchase samsung galaxy product like new condition would definitely hesitate go route satisfied also went optional drop protection screen company great work emailed issue phone far update specific phone locked tmobile issue carrier would make sure purchasing ck carrier make sure compatible,positive,2022,Screen Protector

4.0,Great for person/family with varying electronics!!,"This has the ability to make itself very useful- especially for any who travel or are in the go a lot.. helps great with a family- with numerous devices and varying charge cords.. this does the heavy work for you! The variety of cords are actually attached to battery boost and tuck into backside nicely.. making this an all inclusive power source for when you need it most!<br /><br />Pros: cord are short and attached for ease and convenience. No need to carry excess items or worry if you have appropriate/specific charge cord. Overall device is sleek and neat. Small in size- tucks into purse, briefcase, backpack easily. Multiple units charged before battery boost itself needs to be replenished. Booster feels strong and sturdy.. no loose rattle or fragile pieces to snap off or break. Does its job- can charge a depleted battery back to full status. Power on the move is so convenient!!<br /><br />Cons: battery boost itself doesn’t come with it own charging adapter to replenish booster when power is drained. There is no way to replace the attached cord if one bends or fails over time.. and charge cords DO fail! Device isn’t able to support high speed charging cord in a port.. only standard speed- so, a bit longer to complete task.<br /><br />For price point of $39- I expect a lot from a battery boost! This items sole purpose is to help when another item is failing (am I right?!) and it should do so with an easy, mobile carrying convenience.. Facts: If needing a charge from a battery booster- it’s obviously on the go!! (Otherwise, one would just use wall plug!) So far, this has been powerful in holding a charge and easy fitting into on the go routine. This may seem a bit extra but, it best fits  any with varying devices.. Or a family that falls in that same category. With 4 kiddo’s (teen + older..) they all seem to have their preference of electronic devices yet, are good at forgetting a charge cords when out.. Ha! Problem solved- this fills that need in spades! Ive got power- and the cord to use it!

4.0,Cute convenience -- and it works ...,"I'm always looking for electronic accessories that actually make my life easier.  This is one of those accessories.<br /><br />First, the pros:  it serves double duty: USB --> Lightning or Micro cable; and it's a functional small key ring.  Since I usually keep my car and house keys separate, I tend to use at least 2 key rings, and this could easily serve as one of them, which would give me a usable charging cable 24/7.<br /><br />It's brightly colored, so it's easy to spot in my bag.  It appears to be well made, sturdy, and unless unusually badly handled, it's not likely to rip or tear.  Should last awhile.<br /><br />The lightning attachment fits my iPhone 5S snugly, but not *too* snug -- in other words, it's fairly easy to plug it in.  I have a case on my iPhone, and it fits fine without having to remove the case.<br /><br />It seems to charge relatively quickly on the lightning attachment -- not as fast as the original Apple cable/etc., but would work fine to recharge overnight.  I didn't get an ""incompatible"" message, so my iPhone is happy with it.<br /><br />Cons:  My only quibble with this is the length of the cable.  You release the cable by pushing it through the hippo's ""mouth,"" but even fully extended, you have barely 2"" from USB to hippo and dual-headed lightning/micro to hippo.  This means that you'll need to be careful where you charge -- I have mine charging right now next to my laptop via the USB port on the computer, and it's fine.  I don't see how you could use your device WHILE it's charging -- there's just not enough ""play"" in the cable to allow for that.  Just something to think about.<br /><br />This would make a nice stocking stuffer -- a novelty item that actually serves a useful purpose.

5.0,"adds protection to Sides AND touch Screen as well as a pop of color if you wish, easy on/off","So far, I like these. I have one concern* that I will get to in a moment.<br /><br />First, what I like:<br />--I like the variety of colors available. Adds a little pop of color against my basic black band<br />--Easy on, easy off. The covers are flexible and simply pop on, or pull off when you want to change it out or when you need to charge your VERSA 2. These need to come off when charging as stated in the product description.<br />--I can use buttons and touch screen no problem, no different than without the protector on.<br />--No scratching or rubbing from this<br />--provides some protection to screen and sides. When I first tried my Versa 2 (a christmas gift), I noticed that I would easily bang into things, even more so than the Blaze I had prior. I immediately set out to find a screen protector and was very happy to find these bumpers- it was basically exactly what I was looking for- protection on screen AND sides!<br /><br />What I do not like:<br />--having to take off before charging, but since it is so easy to take off and put on, it really isn't a problem for me.<br />--*potential to fall off. While I was at work I had bumped against something and it popped off. Maybe it was a one time thing, but if it happens regularly, I will be back to say so. (edit: sometimes they pop off. Not enough to make me dislike it. In fact I purchased more)<br /><br />I have the four pack that contains Rose-gold, Rose-pink, Black, and Silver. So far have just used the Rose-pink, which is a purply pink (SEE PIC). I like how it looks with the black band. It is shiny.<br /><br />Currently comfortable with full rating.

With that being said, it can also charge a lot more before needing to be recharged itself. Because of its size, it does weigh more and doesn't have the convenience of a slimmer power bank. For example, you can't really slip this into your pocket while charging your phone. There are lights on it to tell you how much battery power remains. It works with lightning cables which is unique. I have several smaller power banks and they all work with micro USB cords, so my daughter was delighted to learn that she didn't have to carry another cable with her just to charge her iPhone. It lasts longer than the smaller ones before it needs to be recharged, though it does take a while to fully charge it.

A few times I got the leverage off enough that it came part way apart. It was just enough that you couldn't actually use it anymore. The good news is that if you're persistent enough you'll figure out how to take it apart to fix (it was a little tricky, but not too bad).

The glass fits on the screen with no air pockets on the corners and the feel of the glass itself is smooth, like the original gorilla glass.<br /><br />I've had phones (LG G5, Galaxy Note 4) where the glass just wouldn't sit completely flat and there would be one corner that will always have an air pocket.

5.0,Blocks Key FOB Signal for Honda Accord; Has Plenty of Room for Galaxy Phone,"When it’s new, this MIGEEC FARADAY BAG (GPS, RFID Blocking Bag for Cell Phone, Car Key FOB; Black) blocks the signal on my Honda Accord FOB, so that the car won’t start with the FOB in the car.  For it to work, the FOB must be placed inside the zippered compartment (not just the gold-lined pocket).<br /><br />RFID blocking will block signals from credit cards that broadcast wireless signals, and signals from most cell phones. A functioning Faraday bag will also block signals from car key FOBs.  In my experience, Faraday bags stop working after a few months, so you must retest the FOB blocking regularly, if blocking your car’s key FOB signal is important to you.  (If the bag should stop working, wrap your car key FOB completely in a couple of layers of aluminum foil to block the signal.)<br /><br />This Faraday bag is big enough to hold a Samsung Galaxy S10 phone, with plenty of room to spare.  If you store your cell phone in the bag, you should power it off or turn on Airplane mode.

5.0,Finally found my case!,"For clarification: I purchased this case in the combo package in the black color that came with the matching holster. That is why it doesn't show this review as an Amazon verified purchase. I thought it would be best to post my review here as well since this is identical to my purchase but for the color and the inclusion of the holster.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />My husband and I both have a Droid Razr Maxx. His was purchased October 2, 2012 and mine was purchased March 21, 2013.<br /><br />We originally purchased two [[ASIN:B006WC0U4G Otterbox Commuter Case for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]] as I had an Otterbox on my previous phone (a Droid Incredible 2) and loved it. The silicone flaps covering the access ports on the Otterbox Razr Maxx cases were nothing short of a disappointment. They never seated correctly and were always coming loose and flapping around allowing dust and particles into the ports. One of the reasons for purchasing the Otterbox cases was because it had these port covers. Since those failed to perform correctly these cases were removed from our phones and they have been naked and without protection for about a week now.<br /><br />After extensive research of countless cases and reviews here on Amazon, I purchased this case along with three others in a desperate attempt to find the right case for our Droid Razr Maxx phones, once and for all. The cases purchased and compared were:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00829HLZS Asmyna MOTXT912MHPCSO006NP Premium Durable Protective Case for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX XT912 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0077IQA2K Trident Case AG-XT912-BK AEGIS Case for Motorola Droid Razr MAXX (XT912) - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007KZQNP4 Seidio BD2-HR3MTRM-BK SURFACE Case and Holster Combo for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007PPYXME Seidio BD2-HK3MTRMK-BK ACTIVE Combo with Metal Kickstand for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />First, the Asmyna:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-It is easy to 'install'.<br />-The front and back pieces audibly snap together and seems to hold firm.<br />-It feels good in the hand, being somewhat slick and glossy.<br />-Does not add bulk to an already sizable phone.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-It does not line up properly with the camera, flash, speaker or noise-cancelling speaker on the back of the phone.<br />-It is too slick, causing it to slide off of just about any surface.<br />-It is extremely prone to fingerprints.<br />-All ports are openly exposed to the elements (dust and particle collection, moisture, etc.)<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I would not recommend this case as, for me, its cons outweigh its pros. I also cannot attest to this product's ability to protect a phone from a drop as I did not feel confident that it would stay on the phone upon any kind of impact. So I chose not to submit my $600 phone to what I deemed an imminent death. This case will be returned.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Next, the Trident Aegis:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Sturdy, two part design.<br />-Everything lined up beautifully on my Razr Maxx.<br />-Install was a breeze, with only a little encouraging to get the inner silicone liner to set inside the lip of the outer hard shell casing.<br />-The outer hard shell has two built-in mesh-like dust covers that go over the rear speaker and the noise-cancelling speaker when installed on the phone.<br />-The design on the back of the inside silicone liner pokes through the back of the outer hard shell and slightly raises the phone off any surface it is laying on, thus making the speaker sound un-muffled. This is a difficult feature to find in cases these days (why manufacturers don't just place the speaker on the front of the phone for this very reason, is beyond me).<br />-All ports are covered by silicone flaps.<br />-Accessibility to the MicroSD and Sim cards without case removal.<br />-Power and volume buttons are covered and operate as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-When laying face down, the outer rim of the case provides protection to the touch screen by slightly raising it off of any surface it is placed on.<br />-Adds bulk, but not as much as the Otterbox Commuter case.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-There are two locations (along the edge of the MicroSD and Sim card protection flap and along the front, top, center of the phone - directly above 'Motorola') on the silicone liner where the silicone is in extremely thin strips. I do not see these holding up very long as I can see these ripping or tearing after sufficient use.<br />-The protective flaps are flimsy and do not set into place very well (with the exception of the headphone jack cover, which seats almost too well).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />Even though I have listed more pros than cons, I will not be keeping this case. To me, a cell phone case should be something that you can easily install (and remove if necessary) and not be something that you have to continuously battle to stay in place on your phone. Although it is not a deal breaker for me if a phone has protective flaps over access ports or not - it does matter to me that if a case does have these that they set in place properly and not flap around freely. I also am fearful of the longevity of this case given the thinness of the inner silicone liner. For these reasons, I believe I will be returning this Trident Aegis case.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Next, the Seidio Surface (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Lined up well with the camera, flash, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and all buttons.<br />-Does not add any noticeable bulk.<br />-Exterior surface is has a soft-to-the-touch feeling while remaining hard.<br />-Includes a holster.<br />-MicroSD/Sim card access door area of the case is solid. (This may be a con to others, but I prefer this be solid as I rarely ever need to access my SD or Sim cards.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-No silicone components making it very slick.<br />-Easy to put on the phone, but be prepared for an all out battle to remove it. I spent close to fifteen minutes fighting this thing, trying to coerce it off of my phone. Due to its lack of any silicone, I could not get a good grip on the case and had to turn my phone off as I kept pressing the power and volume buttons in my all out brawl.<br />-All ports are exposed (except the MicroSD and Sim card access door, see Pros list above).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />This case is laughable. It is the only case in my many years of cell phone ownership to cause me so much frustration upon trying to remove it from my phone. The scenario I found myself in while trying to remove the case was very similar to trying to get out of a Chinese finger trap - pretty much every movement makes things worse. I prefer a case to fit snugly, as those offer the best protection because they will not slip or slide on the phone. But this Seidio Surface case, wow.. needless to say, despite the pros I listed for it, this case will be returned.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />And, finally, the Seidio Active (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Does not add much bulk (as compared to the Otterbox Commuter)<br />-Well thought out and functional two part design<br />-Feels good in the hand<br />-Easy to operate while holding in one hand (not too heavy)<br />-Silicone along the edges makes is very easy to grip and keep your grip. This case will rarely slip from your grasp.<br />-All ports and the camera, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and buttons line up perfectly.<br />-Power and volume buttons respond with the same (if not better!) sensitivity as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-The MicroSD and Sim card access door is completely blocked (again, I know some others may prefer to have access to this door, but this is a preference of mine as I hardly ever need to remove/replace these cards).<br />-The kickstand is a fun addition - is functional and seems as though it would last quite awhile as long as you were gentle when pulling it from its seated magnetic position.<br />-Includes a belt holster which fits the phone w/case perfectly.<br />-The phone w/case can be seated in the included holster either facing in or out.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The addition of the kickstand on the back causes the phone to tilt toward the top - this muffles the rear speaker.<br />-With so much silicone exposed on the sides of the phone, I can see the potential for these areas being dust magnets.<br />-The top ports (HDMI, Power and headphone jack) are left openly exposed. Although this is not a deal breaker for me, it may be for others. (NOTE: Because the phone can be inserted into the holster either faced in or out, the holster's clip partially covers the top ports, offering some protection. Not much, but thought I would mention it.)<br />-The retention clip on the holster appears to have a disadvantage because of its design - due to the curve and the distance the clip extends from the phone, I can see this potentially catching on things (seat belts, couches, chairs, etc.) and either breaking the clip entirely, rendering the holster useless and requiring a replacement be purchased OR dislodging the phone from the holster allowing it to fall to the ground.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I believe I finally found the case I have been searching for - the Seidio Active. My husband also chose this case of the four we received and I have reviewed here. So, I guess that means I need to purchase another one for myself. The black is exactly what my husband wanted, but I prefer a color that stands out more.. so I suppose I will be buying the red or blue. Once I receive that case, I will update my review to report on the clarity of the color as opposed to the color depicted here online.<br /><br />Thank you for reading. I hope my search helps someone else find the perfect case for them too (as well as saving them the time of conducting the research!).",2013-07-13 00:50:40,0,False,finally found case,clarification

5.0,Exceptionally well made,"I received a review sample and agree with  Mark's very helpful November 5, 2013 review. Do read the dimensions carefully, though, before you purchase this model because it only fits phones of a certain size. Specifically, any phone that has a screen in the 4.3-5 inch range and is NOT larger than 3.3 inches wide or 5.5nches high will work.<br /><br />I tested this with an iPhone 4S and 5 and those fit perfectly. I knew my Samsung Galaxy Note II and Note 3 would not fit, but I had to try. No go, but this case is not designed for them.<br /><br />The heavy and strong armband is built to last, thanks to the dense webbing material and the generous amount of Velcro used. The latter makes this adjustable over a wide range, but this particular model is not designed for thin folks. I weigh over one ninety pounds - frankly I am overweight - and the band fit my arm in its smallest configuration. There is sufficient material to fit much larger folks, but I am guessing that if you are in the 150 pound or below range with thin biceps this is not going to work. End to end the band in it's smallest configuration measures about 12 inches. Use a tape measure around your arm to determine if it truly will fit.<br /><br />You can easily read the screen through the plastic protector, and you can also access buttons through it. The top of the case has a slot for access to the 3.5mm jack if you want to listen to music while running or participating in other sports. That is a nice touch that leads me to conclude that whoever designed this case actually uses one.<br /><br />It does not unduly muffle sound - you can hear and be clearly heard of you have your phone on speaker while wearing this. Of course you cannot do things like take photos unless you remove it from the case, but this is designed to keep your phone handy during sports activities.<br /><br />If you have a phone that fits this case and you want to keep it nearby while exercising or similar activities this case is ideal. Just be sure to measure it as I mentioned above if you are thin.",2013-12-03 18:33:23,2,False,exceptionally well made,received review sample agree mark helpful november 5 2013 review read dimension carefully though purchase model fit phone certain size specifically phone screen 435 inch range larger 33 inch wide 55nches high workbr br tested iphone 4 5 fit perfectly knew samsung galaxy note ii note 3 would fit try go case designed thembr br heavy strong armband built last thanks dense webbing material generous amount velcro used latter make adjustable wide range particular model designed thin folk weigh one ninety pound frankly overweight band fit arm smallest configuration sufficient material fit much larger folk guessing 150 pound range thin biceps going work end end band smallest configuration measure 12 inch use tape measure around arm determine truly fitbr br easily read screen plastic protector also access button top case slot access 35mm jack want listen music running participating sport nice touch lead conclude whoever designed case actually us onebr br unduly muffle sound hear clearly heard phone speaker wearing course thing like take photo unless remove case designed keep phone handy sport activitiesbr br phone fit case want keep nearby exercising similar activity case ideal sure measure mentioned thin,exceptionally well made received review sample agree mark helpful november 5 2013 review read dimension carefully though purchase model fit phone certain size specifically phone screen 435 inch range larger 33 inch wide 55nches high workbr br tested iphone 4 5 fit perfectly knew samsung galaxy note ii note 3 would fit try go case designed thembr br heavy strong armband built last thanks dense webbing material generous amount velcro used latter make adjustable wide range particular model designed thin folk weigh one ninety pound frankly overweight band fit arm smallest configuration sufficient material fit much larger folk guessing 150 pound range thin biceps going work end end band smallest configuration measure 12 inch use tape measure around arm determine truly fitbr br easily read screen plastic protector also access button top case slot access 35mm jack want listen music running participating sport nice touch lead conclude whoever designed case actually us onebr br unduly muffle sound hear clearly heard phone speaker wearing course thing like take photo unless remove case designed keep phone handy sport activitiesbr br phone fit case want keep nearby exercising similar activity case ideal sure measure mentioned thin,positive,2013,Screen Protector

5.0,"Fine Battery Pack, Works Well","I have worked with several power banks similar to this one and I have seen them come with a lot of features that may or may not be useful. This one sticks fairly closely to the basics and it gets things right.<br /><br />This is a 20k mA bank and it can change a phone repeatedly between needing to be charged itself. It has two Type A USB output ports (QC) and one Type C in/out USB port, and it is capable of outputting on all three ports simultaneously. It's small enough to pack in a briefcase or backpack, though it is heavly and bulky enough that it is a little unwieldy in a pocket.<br /><br />The display is nice and bright and shows the remaining charge capacity.<br /><br />It does have an emergeny light that can be turned on and off, and I have seen this type of feature on other banks and have found it to be less than useful most of the time. That said, if you need an emergency light source (albeit a relatively dim one) it is available.<br /><br />The charging speeds are impressive - if the receiving device can handle the speeds. Most devices I have worked with are limited by their own onboard ports and not the device sending the power. If you have a device that can handle a QC input or charges via USB-C, this bank does well. If not, this bank will still charge it but cannot charge it as quickly (in other words, it scales properly).<br /><br />It comes with a nice mesh pouch for carrying and storage.<br /><br />So far, I have no complaints with this power bank. It works well and has a generous power storage capacity.

The material is very durable - so it feels like it will last.<br /><br />Considerations (not really Cons, but definitely FYI)<br />1. This adds some bulk to the phone in terms of weight and size.<br />2. The pockets don't really expand or shrink. The snap means items won't fall out, but you can not fit an infinite amount in here. I have 3 cards and 2 bills (money) folded inside and I have probably room for 2 more cards (I checked - but it's tight). 5 cards (no money) is the max comfort fit.

5.0,Better Than Expected!,"I'm a teacher and a yearbook advisor who has found that most watches have a metal button or latch that scratches up my computer and makes it difficult to work on a laptop.  I decided to give this magnetized band a try.  I flipped it over so the light pink color is on the outside and away I went.  After wearing it for a week, I can 100% say I'm over the moon with this band!  You can get it wet (which other loop bands often can't unless you get the tighter plastic ones) and it snaps on and off like a dream.<br /><br />I can now easily use my computer and other office items without scratching anything or having the underside get in the way.  This has been a great band and I'm going to look into a few more.<br /><br />The only ""con"" I've seen is that fabric can catch the end and make it come off.

5.0,Easy! Works beautifully on my J3 2016.,"Beautiful kit! Has everything you need: screen protector, clear instructions, alcohol infused cloths, dust removing tape, microfiber cloth, temporary hinge tapes and bubble diffusing cardboard piece. I didn't even need to use the cardboard piece... The hinge tapes are a truly inspired idea! They help you position the screen on your camera and keep it in the correct position until you are ready to proceed with exposing the sticky side.<br /><br />So, I positioned the screen protector with the wonderful hinge tapes. Then I flipped it back up and cleaned the phone's screen with the alcohol infused cloth, and I wore nitrile gloves because handling isopropyl alcohol with bare hands is simply not a good idea (per Hulda Regehr Clark - The Cure for All Diseases). Then, I decided it's really a good idea to just keep the gloves on for the rest of the operation, so as to avoid accidental smudges/fingerprints in the work area.<br /><br />After the alcohol cleaning, I used the dust removing tape, which worked nicely. Then, I pulled the backing off the screen protector and gently let it drop into place onto the phone. To my amazement, it just very naturally adhered to the phone, without any further input from me. I could see the contact area spreading at a good pace and leaving absolutely no air bubbles in its wake. It just kind of married up with the screen of its own accord, as if by magic. No further work needed from me. It fell perfectly in place and with no air bubbles whatsoever (have I mentioned that before...?)! Wow! How cool is that???<br /><br />The screen protector looks very nice on the phone and it cleans easily too. Lines up perfectly with all the needed connections on my J3 2016.

I've been using this for a few days (alternating among other compression socks from a different brand.) This pair is as effective as the other brand in managing swelling in my left leg from a trauma, but is vastly more comfortable.<br /><br />What I love about these versus the other is the way it breathes. Given that I live in a hot, humid place (and it's summer as I write this) that alone inspired me to rate it so highly. It's machine washable (I use cold/cold and regular cycle), which is another plus. Do note the product specs on this page because these are a blend of merino wool and synthetics.<br /><br />The compression aspect is equal to the other socks I use. I cannot honestly tell the difference one way or the other in that regard.<br /><br />Bottom line: you can have both compression AND comfort with these.

My ear fits these too well.<br /><br />Be aware that this headset appears to no longer be fully supported online. Plantronics is now Poly. I just downloaded the latest version of Plantronics Hub from Poly's support site, which appears to be the remnants of Plantronics support site. When I run the Plantronics Hub and try to update the headset I get, ""Plantronics Hub is unable to connect to the server."" I suspect that the update server no longer exists, though I can't be sure. The most recent firmware version is v.109, and may be the last one. That doesn't take away from the quality and usefulness of the headset at all. It's still the best noise-cancelling headset I can comfortably wear. Driving a truck I wear one all the time.<br /><br />Having said all that, I have had issues with some of the ones I've purchased more recently, and my wife has too. Some of them don't cancel noise as well as others, though they all come up as the same product, and the same firmware version. Early on, they were all flawless. Lately, they're not.

5.0,Simple to Use and it Works,"One of the biggest aggravations I have faced when traveling is that my mobile phone is very efficient at erasing hotel keys. Although less of a concern I do not like powering off my phone or turning the volume all the way down all of the time even when I need to silence it.  This little pouch seems to be a good solution.<br /><br />In appearance on the outside this little pouch does not appear to be anything special. It is a nylon weave bag about the size of a business envelope with no remarkable features on the outside. However, on the inside is a pocket made of reflective, tightly woven material that does not appear especially interesting - until you put your phone in there.<br /><br />I have a Nokia phone and I put it in the pouch, in the pocket where the reflective surface would face my phone on both sides. Before I put in my phone I observed that I had a good LTE signal, 3 of 5 bars in my basement. Within 30 seconds of putting my phone in there and partially closing the flap, my signal was gone and the phone was not able to even recognize the service provider to which it should connect. I pulled the phone out and it shot back up to 3 bars immediately.<br /><br />I have not yet had an opportunity to see if it will work to prevent the phone from demagnetizing a hotel key but I will get to do so next month. When that happens I will return here to update my review.<br /><br />This pouch definitely isolates the phone and makes it easy to lturn the phone off without actually turning it off. It completely cuts off the phone’s ability to connect to the network and it is very easy to use. It’s easier to remember to take my phone out of the pouch than it is to remember to turn it back on again.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

4.0,Band connection to watch are loose which concerns me.,"[[VIDEOID:bafd7f783d0934f7b55c572bd5c9367d]] *Update* I have wear for sometime now with no issues due to the loose connectors.<br /><br />First, I really like the band but the loose connections at the watch are a concern to me.  However, with that said I have went for a run, washed the car, did chores with no failure. The connections have held.  I don’t know if the connections being loose is a one off or an actually quality control/escapement issue.<br /><br />I do not have an apple trail loop so I cannot directly compare to the OEM.  I purchased my watch with with the nylon rugged loop. I do have other apple sport loop bands which I did use for comparison.<br /><br />So, with that said. I like the look and feel of the band.  The material used is soft and the stitching seems to be well done.  The Velcro pads are securely attached to the band.  That leads me to my first issue which is the bond created by the Velcro hooks and piles.  It doesn’t seem to be as strong as I would have expected and compared to my Apple sport loop band.  At this point, I haven’t had any issues with it as of yet the Velcro stay secure.  As the material wears some I assume it may become stronger.<br /><br />My biggest concern is the connections points and how loosely they attach to the watch.  As you can see in the video the fit is loose and beyond what I consider reasonable.  I did compare this to my Apple sport loop band and the connectors were tight at the watch with no wiggle.<br /><br />Overall, the band is an affordable alternative to the more expensive Apple trail loop.",2022-12-17 21:46:27,0,False,band connection watch loose concern,videoidbafd7f783d0934f7b55c572bd5c9367d update wear sometime issue due loose connectorsbr br first really like band loose connection watch concern however said went run washed car chore failure connection held dont know connection loose one actually quality controlescapement issuebr br apple trail loop directly compare oem purchased watch nylon rugged loop apple sport loop band use comparisonbr br said like look feel band material used soft stitching seems well done velcro pad securely attached band lead first issue bond created velcro hook pile doesnt seem strong would expected compared apple sport loop band point havent issue yet velcro stay secure material wear assume may become strongerbr br biggest concern connection point loosely attach watch see video fit loose beyond consider reasonable compare apple sport loop band connector tight watch wigglebr br overall band affordable alternative expensive apple trail loop,band connection watch loose concern videoidbafd7f783d0934f7b55c572bd5c9367d update wear sometime issue due loose connectorsbr br first really like band loose connection watch concern however said went run washed car chore failure connection held dont know connection loose one actually quality controlescapement issuebr br apple trail loop directly compare oem purchased watch nylon rugged loop apple sport loop band use comparisonbr br said like look feel band material used soft stitching seems well done velcro pad securely attached band lead first issue bond created velcro hook pile doesnt seem strong would expected compared apple sport loop band point havent issue yet velcro stay secure material wear assume may become strongerbr br biggest concern connection point loosely attach watch see video fit loose beyond consider reasonable compare apple sport loop band connector tight watch wigglebr br overall band affordable alternative expensive apple trail loop,positive,2022,Screen Protector
4.0,"No-Nonsense, One-Piece Case for Galaxy S8+; Drop-Tested to 12 Feet","This INCIPIO DUALPRO CASE FOR SAMSUNG GALAXY S8+ (Black/Black) is a good, no-nonsense, one-piece case that fits my Galaxy S8+ smartphone perfectly.  There's a cutout in back for the fingerprint sensor, camera flash, and camera lens; there are holes or cutouts in all the right places for the light sensor, mic, charging port, and headset jack.  There are raised “buttons” for the on/off button, the Bixby button, and the volume buttons.<br /><br />The case itself has a silky feel when you hold it in your hand.  The “dual-layer protection” consists of a rigid outer shell and a flexible silicone bumper.  The case is advertised as drop-tested to 12 feet--I didn't personally test this.<br /><br />You’ll want to use a screen protector with this case.  The bumper doesn't rise above the side edges--of necessity, because of the curved screen--and it doesn't rise very high above the top and bottom edges.  If you lay your S8+ face down carelessly, it's possible to scratch the screen.<br /><br />This is a nice, serviceable, reasonably priced case.  It works for me, because I carry my phone in a leatherette holster case that protects the screen (see, e.g., [[ASIN:B00OMODOYO an S7 Edge case that also fits my S8+ phone]]).<br /><br />EDIT 4/26/17:  The silky finish that I liked at first turns out to be a drawback.  The Galaxy S8+ is a tall, fairly heavy smartphone, and it slides through my hand unless I grip the DualPro Case rather tightly.

4.0,Definitely worth taking a look!,"The Yoobao 2000mAh Power Bank Portable Phone Charger is about the size of a cell phone but a lot heavier. It comes with a charging cable and directions. There are two USB ports, one type-C input, one micro input and one lighting input.  I like that you are able to charge multiple devices (2) at once. There is a LED display that shows the percentage of charge left on the device, during and after use. The time it took to charge my cell phone (android) wasn’t bad, but I couldn’t charge my Acer Spin 13 completely without shutting it down. I will warn you that charging the Yoobao was not fast. I found that it was easier and faster to fully charge the portable battery using my computer. In conclusion, I think the key selling point and what makes this device worth considering is the that fact that this is an inexpensive, portable (you can carry this device in your car, laptop/computer bag or purse) device that can charge multiple devices (android and iPhone) at once.

5.0,Almost Perfect,"I ordered another fine-point capacative stylus like this last  year. I also liked that one, but it was quite quirky and turned off too quickly. This one is better: it stays on longer and is longer in length so it fits all but the hugest ""paw."" The blue light that indicates power is easier to see, and I like the rubber cap for the point and also the cover for the charging port, although the magnetic attraction on the latter is not strong enough. If you put the rubber point cap over the charging port cover while you're using the stylus, when you pull the rubber point off it it takes the cover right off.<br /><br />Again, my complaint is that there is NOTHING to attach this stylus to your tablet. Pens have pen clips, why doesn't this thing? Included with my stylus was a ""gift"" of two square flaps of stiff vinyl, with an elastic loop on each. This elastic loop fits around the stylus, so I take it it's supposed to be some sort of gadget to keep the stylus with the tablet, but I can't really figure out how it's supposed to work, unless you're supposed to tuck it under the tablet in your tablet case and then fold the tablet cast closed around it (if your tablet case allows that), but I don't know, because they came with no instructions.<br /><br />I don't suppose the darn thing could beep or something before it decides it's not been used enough and powers down. It is very aggravating when you are working with it, pause to think, and it shuts down and you think your tablet  has frozen instead.<br /><br />I must say that this stylus is very accurate in use with drawing. Other styluses that I have used start their lines a millimeter or two to the right or left of the actual pen point; this is pretty accurate! If you are just goofing off trying to trace a photo, it makes your drawing come out very nice indeed.<br /><br />Pros: Long, light, accurate, very sensitive to touch<br /><br />Cons: No PEN CLIP, no shutoff warning, connector cover magnet weak.<br /><br />And please, how do I properly use the ""gift"" that comes with the stylus?",2019-03-18 13:27:37,0,False,almost perfect,ordered another finepoint capacative stylus like last year also liked one quite quirky turned quickly one better stay longer longer length fit hugest paw blue light indicates power easier see like rubber cap point also cover charging port although magnetic attraction latter strong enough put rubber point cap charging port cover youre using stylus pull rubber point take cover right offbr br complaint nothing attach stylus tablet pen pen clip doesnt thing included stylus gift two square flap stiff vinyl elastic loop elastic loop fit around stylus take supposed sort gadget keep stylus tablet cant really figure supposed work unless youre supposed tuck tablet tablet case fold tablet cast closed around tablet case allows dont know came instructionsbr br dont suppose darn thing could beep something decides used enough power aggravating working pause think shuts think tablet frozen insteadbr br must say stylus accurate use drawing stylus used start line millimeter two right left actual pen point pretty accurate goofing trying trace photo make drawing come nice indeedbr br pro long light accurate sensitive touchbr br con pen clip shutoff warning connector cover magnet weakbr br please properly use gift come stylus,almost perfect ordered another finepoint capacative stylus like last year also liked one quite quirky turned quickly one better stay longer longer length fit hugest paw blue light indicates power easier see like rubber cap point also cover charging port although magnetic attraction latter strong enough put rubber point cap charging port cover youre using stylus pull rubber point take cover right offbr br complaint nothing attach stylus tablet pen pen clip doesnt thing included stylus gift two square flap stiff vinyl elastic loop elastic loop fit around stylus take supposed sort gadget keep stylus tablet cant really figure supposed work unless youre supposed tuck tablet tablet case fold tablet cast closed around tablet case allows dont know came instructionsbr br dont suppose darn thing could beep something decides used enough power aggravating working pause think shuts think tablet frozen insteadbr br must say stylus accurate use drawing stylus used start line millimeter two right left actual pen point pretty accurate goofing trying trace photo make drawing come nice indeedbr br pro long light accurate sensitive touchbr br con pen clip shutoff warning connector cover magnet weakbr br please properly use gift come stylus,positive,2019,Screen Protector

5.0,Keep Your Electronics Powered and Ready,"Electronics are all around us and at the very least, most of us at least own a smartphone or iphone. No one wants to get caught with a phone that has lost its charge and, luckily, there are power banks ready to step in when needed. Manufacturers keep getting better and better with power banks and an excellent choice is this SAFUEL Power Bank.<br /><br />Straight from the package, this power bank already has a good deal of available charge, so you can use it immediately. It has a digital display which is far superior to the power banks of old, most of which indicated the available power by displaying either one, two, three, or four bars of light which forced you to guess. There is no doubt how much power remains with this power bank. The percentage is right there, before your eyes.<br /><br />This is a fast- charging power bank. From my own tests, I found that it takes about 17 minutes to add 10 percentage points of charge. So, at that rate, the power bank can be charged completely in about 2.5 to 3 hours. It charges phones quickly also. Plug your phone into this power bank and you will find that, for a smartphone like I have, it takes about 3 percent of the power bank to add 10 percent to the phone. That’s a ratio of about three to one, which means this power bank, when fully charged, can completely charge three smartphones like mine.<br /><br />We need our electronics for work and to stay connected. We cannot afford to have our electronics lose their power and this power bank from SAFUEL is ready to make sure you have the power when you need it most. It charges quickly and keeps your phone or other device going for the duration.",2022-04-11 19:39:07,0,False,keep electronics powered ready,electronics around u least u least smartphone iphone one want get caught phone lost charge luckily power bank ready step needed manufacturer keep getting better better power bank excellent choice safuel power bankbr br straight package power bank already good deal available charge use immediately digital display far superior power bank old indicated available power displaying either one two three four bar light forced guess doubt much power remains power bank percentage right eyesbr br fast charging power bank test found take 17 minute add 10 percentage point charge rate power bank charged completely 25 3 hour charge phone quickly also plug phone power bank find smartphone like take 3 percent power bank add 10 percent phone thats ratio three one mean power bank fully charged completely charge three smartphones like minebr br need electronics work stay connected afford electronics lose power power bank safuel ready make sure power need charge quickly keep phone device going duration,keep electronics powered ready electronics around u least u least smartphone iphone one want get caught phone lost charge luckily power bank ready step needed manufacturer keep getting better better power bank excellent choice safuel power bankbr br straight package power bank already good deal available charge use immediately digital display far superior power bank old indicated available power displaying either one two three four bar light forced guess doubt much power remains power bank percentage right eyesbr br fast charging power bank test found take 17 minute add 10 percentage point charge rate power bank charged completely 25 3 hour charge phone quickly also plug phone power bank find smartphone like take 3 percent power bank add 10 percent phone thats ratio three one mean power bank fully charged completely charge three smartphones like minebr br need electronics work stay connected afford electronics lose power power bank safuel ready make sure power need charge quickly keep phone device going duration,positive,2022,Phone Charger

(Like all wireless chargers, this one charges more slowly than a phone cable connected directly to an AC outlet.)<br /><br />If you have a Galaxy S10 phone, you don’t even need a light on your wireless charging pad.  The phone’s display tells you everything you need to know about the charging status--whether the phone is charging, how much charge is currently in your phone, and how much time remains before the phone is fully charged.  When the phone is 100% charged, the display tells you that as well.<br /><br />Anker products have a good reputation for quality and reliability.

4.0,"Nice Case, but Not a Snug Fit Along the Short Edges","I have an iPhone 6s and I am pleased with it, and I have been looking for the right accessories for it. I have tried dozens of cases and there are two basic types – cases that protect the phone and cases that are more of a fashion statement. This case is in the former category and it’s a nice case overall. I have found one issue with it that is potentially a real problem, though for the moment it is just an irritation.<br /><br />This is an unusual case when compared to many others I have used. It is a two-piece case that most easily goes on the phone in two steps. The main piece is a large rubber shell with squishy bumper protection that makes an excellent shock absorber. Most cases I have used have harder plastic bumper protection or even a metal band, and these are fine but they do not absorb shock as much as something softer. The other part of this case is a hard outer shell that clamps onto the back of the phone and holds the rubber shell in place. If you try to put the whole thing on the phone at once it is quite difficult, but when done one piece at a time it is easy.<br /><br />The case provides soft button covers for the power and volume buttons. These are well placed and seem to work just fine. This is not true of all cases so it is reassuring that this case has the buttons lined up properly. It also has openings for the charging/data port, the speaker and the audio jack. And, the case does not interfere with the vibrate switch.<br /><br />The issue I have with this case is the fit, actually. The case is snug around the long length of the phone which is as it should be. It is loose along the short edges though, enough that bits of debris get in between the case and the phone. On the long edge, the case is tight where the hard shell holds it, but over the buttons it is quite loose like along the short edges. I have not found a workaround for this. The loose fit is the only issue I have found with this case. It’s not loose enough to make the case fall off and it does not compromise the protection, but it does open up the possibility of getting dirt under it.<br /><br />This is a nice case and I do like it. It looks nice, it provides good protection and it is affordable. It is not a completely snug fit, though, which is the one flaw I have found with it.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at minimal or no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it.",2016-07-16 04:53:39,1,False,nice case snug fit along short edge,iphone 6 pleased looking right accessory tried dozen case two basic type case protect phone case fashion statement case former category nice case overall found one issue potentially real problem though moment irritationbr br unusual case compared many others used twopiece case easily go phone two step main piece large rubber shell squishy bumper protection make excellent shock absorber case used harder plastic bumper protection even metal band fine absorb shock much something softer part case hard outer shell clamp onto back phone hold rubber shell place try put whole thing phone quite difficult done one piece time easybr br case provides soft button cover power volume button well placed seem work fine true case reassuring case button lined properly also opening chargingdata port speaker audio jack case interfere vibrate switchbr br issue case fit actually case snug around long length phone loose along short edge though enough bit debris get case phone long edge case tight hard shell hold button quite loose like along short edge found workaround loose fit issue found case loose enough make case fall compromise protection open possibility getting dirt itbr br nice case like look nice provides good protection affordable completely snug fit though one flaw found itbr br disclosure provided sample product exchange fair honest thorough review even though received product minimal cost rated reviewed product without bias based solely experience,nice case snug fit along short edge iphone 6 pleased looking right accessory tried dozen case two basic type case protect phone case fashion statement case former category nice case overall found one issue potentially real problem though moment irritationbr br unusual case compared many others used twopiece case easily go phone two step main piece large rubber shell squishy bumper protection make excellent shock absorber case used harder plastic bumper protection even metal band fine absorb shock much something softer part case hard outer shell clamp onto back phone hold rubber shell place try put whole thing phone quite difficult done one piece time easybr br case provides soft button cover power volume button well placed seem work fine true case reassuring case button lined properly also opening chargingdata port speaker audio jack case interfere vibrate switchbr br issue case fit actually case snug around long length phone loose along short edge though enough bit debris get case phone long edge case tight hard shell hold button quite loose like along short edge found workaround loose fit issue found case loose enough make case fall compromise protection open possibility getting dirt itbr br nice case like look nice provides good protection affordable completely snug fit though one flaw found itbr br disclosure provided sample product exchange fair honest thorough review even though received product minimal cost rated reviewed product without bias based solely experience,positive,2016,Phone Case

4.0,Allows for Multiple Intervals,"A timer outlet like this one is useful for a number of things, such as setting the coffee pot to go off in the morning just before you get up or for turning a lamp on and off at night to make it look like someone is home when this is not the case. Most of the timer outlets I have seen and used have been simple, analog devices that are pretty easy to set and are mechanical. This is the first digital timer I have seen and used and so far I have had good success with it, save for minor issues.<br /><br />This timer outlet features a large LCD display with the time, day of the week, timer status, mode and whether the timer is set for random mode. It has an internal battery so that it will retain settings during a power outage once it is charged. It has multiple programs that can be set so that it is possible to set the timer to work at the same time every day or to create several different time intervals to power on and off.<br /><br />Setting the timer is mostly easy though I found that setting the time interval worked the exact opposite of what I expected. I contacted the seller and after a discussion with them concluded that I am either reading the instructions incorrectly or reading the timer wrong. Regardless, I have a handle on how to set the timer now and have found a good use for it.<br /><br />I plugged my router into it and used the timer to down the router at a certain time in the night (I have teens – that should explain why I am doing that). I set the timer to shut off my router at midnight and turn it back on at 4am. It did exactly as I had hoped and at midnight the router shut down very abruptly. At 4am it powered back up and worked as expected.<br /><br />I like the fact that there are 10 different programs that can be set so that there is no simple “on at time x, off at time y” setting like with analog timers. Using the various buttons you can set a program to trigger on a certain day, every day, every other day, just weekdays and a lot more. In addition to the day of the week there are buttons to set the hour and minute, turn on random intervals and reset the timer. It’s easy to switch between the clock and timers as well.<br /><br />So far this timer has worked out well for me, though there was some learning required when I first started working with it. Now that I have it figured out it does a good job for me and I like it. I had some issues with figuring out the way it determines when there is power supplied to the device and when it cuts power. The number of different programs and how they can be set up is impressive and this timer can do a lot more than the old analog ones can. It’s a decent timed outlet worth some consideration.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Waterproof way to take my smartphone trail riding or hiking with the dogs,"I received a sample of this Wiszen waterproof phone case (in the clear) for testing and review and I am glad I accepted it. It weighs nothing and is actually very flexible which means it could easily be packed and taken on vacation or stored in the glove box of your car until needed. It comes with two carrying options - an adjustable velcro strap that slides through the handle on the back or a longer lanyard you could wear around your neck or tie to something. I attached it to my pants belt loop walking dogs in the woods - my phone wasn't at risk of falling out of my pockets while throwing a ball or wrestling around with the hounds. The case stayed closed and there was no humidity built up inside or on my phone afterwards.<br /><br />The clear plastic does allow for operation of the touchscreen display and there is a second clear plastic window on the back so you can shoot pictures without removing your phone. The photos are a little fuzzy, but you do have a barrier in front of the lens. No deduction there. My one issue was using this with my Fire Phone - the four sensors on the front of the Fire Phone detect any covering as a face and black out the screen entirely. Thus making it impossible to use this with that phone inside. Trying it with my old Galaxy Note 1 was not a problem at all. I was also able to fit my driver's license and a few dollars in the case with the phone - very handy.

4.0,AWESOME 3 Way Mountable Car Phone Holder with FAST Qi Charging!,"[[VIDEOID:d00a098401fdbf75993b74498effdac1]] I have tried, tested and reviewed several car cell phone holders and this one is definitely one of the best ones.<br /><br />Assembly and installation was quick and straightforward.<br /><br />The unit can be mounted via three different methods within your vehicle.  The set comes complete with 3 different brackets: a gooseneck stand that is attached to a cup sized weight, allowing the stand to rest within a cup holder; on a vent clip bracket, allowing for either vertical or horizontal mounting; or on a bracket that can be attached via 3M double sided foam tape to any smooth surface within your vehicle.<br /><br />I tested each method and they all worked perfectly.  For the cup holder method, when you twist the cup from the neck, three wings extend which help snug it within your cup holder. The vent clip worked equally well securing tightly to my air-vent without falling as we traveled.  The third bracket mentioned that can be attached to smooth surfaces has the same ball joint at the other end allowing for complete control of viewing angle.<br /><br />The bottom feet of the phone cradle are easy to adjust so the Qi charger falls at the correct level to charge your phone.<br /><br />Once plugged in the side arms immediately open to accept the phone as it detects motion in front of the phone charging cradle.  Once the phone is placed a light sensor detects the phone and automatically secures the phone by the arms squeezing inward. To release you simply touch the small metal sensor on either side.<br /><br />The Bolt Car Mount has an internal battery so even if you cut the power to the unit, it will still open the arms by pressing the button.<br /><br />THIS SET DOES NOT INCLUDE AN USB 3.0 CAR CHARGER - while many other sets do. Power can be delivered by either a Micro USB Cable (not included) or a USB C Cable (included).<br /><br />The average charging speed in my tests using my iPhone 8 Plus was 6% per 10 minutes - on par with other similar devices.<br /><br />This is a very high quality set complete with 3 brackets allowing for multiple ways to mount for less expense than similar sets that only include one mounting method.  While it does not come complete with the USB 3.0 Power Adapter, many vehicles do not require that as USB ports are built in to newer vehicles.<br /><br />This Qi Charging Set for vehicles is among the very best I have had the opportunity to review and at this price point I would not hesitate to recommend it.<br /><br />⭐️As with all Drew’s Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

4.0,"4.5 stars. Secure, lots of good features, holds plenty, nice look & feel","So far, so good. Good fit for my Google Pixel 6 Pro. Cut outs are well aligned, and the frame holds my phone securely (so far). I might consider another color. Read on for more details, and concerns.<br /><br />I chose this phone wallet because I prefer a wallet style holder. I like having my phone entirely covered up. I can toss it in a bag and not worry about it. I like just grabbing the phone, via wrist strap and do my shopping without carrying a purse.<br /><br />I just carry a couple of cards and some paper. When I saw that some cases have a zipper section, I was intrigued. I looked at several styles before settling on this one. What ultimately made me choose it? The zipper portion being on the outer portion of the phone case. I was worried that the zipper pull would touch the phone or the sides, and create possible scratches or get caught while trying to close the case. Or even just interfere in other ways I hadn't yet considered. Other phone cases have the zipper portion inside, close to the phone. I didn't like that. This one is on outside. I like that.<br /><br />Next, there are card slots that dont touch the screen. There are also some card slots that do, but there is an OPTION to just use the sets that dont touch the screen. And that portion snaps closed. It isnt just flailing open while my phone is in use. I like that-- added security. My last phone case when open, meant that the cards were exposed. Also, I had slots that touched the screen, and the cards made little scratches over time on the screen, and then once I put a screen protector on, scratches on the protector. SO this has 7 card slots that do not touch the screen at all. Then there is a panel of 3 slots that do. I dont need every slot filled, so I know I could keep the slots that are against the screen clear.<br /><br />Basically goes like this: Magnetic closer strap, zipper portion, then 7 slot card area that has snap closure, then on opposite side has 3 card slots and a pocket, then the phone area. Includes a wrist strap.<br /><br />The zipper area is spacious, but not too big, bulky. I would rather it was deep enough to be able to fold my cash in half and slide in, but that is not possible. I have to fold it further to get it in place. Just needed to be a couple millimeters wider and it would work. Oh well. There is a pocket on the slot side that touches the phone where I can simply fold the cash in half and slide it in. I like the added carrying space.<br /><br />Going back to the slots. The slot that has the clear window, also has the snap closure rivet. Be mindful of what you place there because for some reason, it makes for an extra tight fit, and it slights scrubs against what you put there. I decided to only put a credit card or ID if I have it in a paper protective sleeve. I dont want anything scratched up. Other side has the other rivet, but doesn't seem to rub anything I put there.<br /><br />Overall I like it, am pleased with it. Could be a little better in ways, but still has all that I am looking for. Adds minor bulk compared to other cases, but it suits my needs just fine. I do feel secure with it, and that is most important. Might buy another in a different color.",2021-11-27 16:08:17,3,True,45 star secure lot good feature hold plenty nice look feel,far good good fit google pixel 6 pro cut out well aligned frame hold phone securely far might consider another color read detail concernsbr br chose phone wallet prefer wallet style holder like phone entirely covered toss bag worry like grabbing phone via wrist strap shopping without carrying pursebr br carry couple card paper saw case zipper section intrigued looked several style settling one ultimately made choose zipper portion outer portion phone case worried zipper pull would touch phone side create possible scratch get caught trying close case even interfere way hadnt yet considered phone case zipper portion inside close phone didnt like one outside like thatbr br next card slot dont touch screen also card slot option use set dont touch screen portion snap closed isnt flailing open phone use like added security last phone case open meant card exposed also slot touched screen card made little scratch time screen put screen protector scratch protector 7 card slot touch screen panel 3 slot dont need every slot filled know could keep slot screen clearbr br basically go like magnetic closer strap zipper portion 7 slot card area snap closure opposite side 3 card slot pocket phone area includes wrist strapbr br zipper area spacious big bulky would rather deep enough able fold cash half slide possible fold get place needed couple millimeter wider would work oh well pocket slot side touch phone simply fold cash half slide like added carrying spacebr br going back slot slot clear window also snap closure rivet mindful place reason make extra tight fit slight scrub put decided put credit card id paper protective sleeve dont want anything scratched side rivet doesnt seem rub anything put therebr br overall like pleased could little better way still looking add minor bulk compared case suit need fine feel secure important might buy another different color,45 star secure lot good feature hold plenty nice look feel far good good fit google pixel 6 pro cut out well aligned frame hold phone securely far might consider another color read detail concernsbr br chose phone wallet prefer wallet style holder like phone entirely covered toss bag worry like grabbing phone via wrist strap shopping without carrying pursebr br carry couple card paper saw case zipper section intrigued looked several style settling one ultimately made choose zipper portion outer portion phone case worried zipper pull would touch phone side create possible scratch get caught trying close case even interfere way hadnt yet considered phone case zipper portion inside close phone didnt like one outside like thatbr br next card slot dont touch screen also card slot option use set dont touch screen portion snap closed isnt flailing open phone use like added security last phone case open meant card exposed also slot touched screen card made little scratch time screen put screen protector scratch protector 7 card slot touch screen panel 3 slot dont need every slot filled know could keep slot screen clearbr br basically go like magnetic closer strap zipper portion 7 slot card area snap closure opposite side 3 card slot pocket phone area includes wrist strapbr br zipper area spacious big bulky would rather deep enough able fold cash half slide possible fold get place needed couple millimeter wider would work oh well pocket slot side touch phone simply fold cash half slide like added carrying spacebr br going back slot slot clear window also snap closure rivet mindful place reason make extra tight fit slight scrub put decided put credit card id paper protective sleeve dont want anything scratched side rivet doesnt seem rub anything put therebr br overall like pleased could little better way still looking add minor bulk compared case suit need fine feel secure important might buy another different color,positive,2021,Phone Holder
5.0,Really pet case for my iPhone,"The cut outs are perfect, size is perfect. I only have two small problems. 1. It's developed a small bubble. Not really a huge problem, but detracts from the overall beauty of the thing. I've had other similar cases for other phones and they've all done the same thing so I'm going on that being very normal. 2. I'm having some trouble keeping my pop socket on it. It appears to be a material the pop socket doesn't like to stick to. I'm thinking one of the adhesive discs that are meant to be used with a glass backed phone would likely solve that issue but I don't have one at the moment to test that theory. So overall I love the case. It's really pretty on my rose gold phone (I picked the rose gold glitter).<br /><br />Also, it looks really cool from the front with the torch lit.

Well I so wanted this mount to work as I don’t care for the vent ones and my car vents are elongated and we live in FL, air is not something you want to block.

5.0,Work as Expected,"With a couple of iPhones in the house I am always trying to track down lightning cables. I selected these in the hopes that they would be a viable alternative to buying Apple-branded cables.

As it turns out, they work just fine, and the colors make the different cables easy to tell apart (for those of us that have color preferences).<br /><br />Without any indication of certification, I wasn’t sure if these cables would work at all, though most uncertified cables I have seen and used have at least permitted the phone to be charged. Only one way to find out – I plugged my phone into my computer using one of the cables. My phone immediately started charging and my computer was able to access the storage in my phone. That’s really all there is to it, they work.<br /><br />The cable is shielded in a nylon weave and is terminated on both ends with a hard plastic plug with a sleeve before capping in an aluminum casing.

5.0,"Much easier process than last year. Zero bubbles, no degradation of screen clarity. See photo","I have used the iCarez screen protectors in various formats on multiple devices for several years with excellent results every time - I currently have them on two Fire tablets and it was a no brainer to go directly to iCarez for a tempered glass protector for my brand new LG V10 phone. (I also watched a video online of a guy hammering his and then removing it - no damage at all to his phone) The instruction booklet inside said that they have simplified the installation process, so I scanned the bar code and watched the video before I did anything. Sure enough, it's easier than last summer when I put the last one on a tablet. Plus the clarity and gorgeous display are in no way degraded by this glass protector - my photos etc are still just as sharp and pretty as before.<br /><br />The key here is be vigilant about making the screen absolutely pristine before you apply the protector and to do it on a level surface. I used the kitchen counter top. Wipe the phone all in one direction with the provided wet wipe and then the dust cloth. REPEAT. Repeat again and do not touch the screen. Wait a few seconds for it to dry completely.

5.0,SECURE case for the Galaxy Note,"In the month I have had my new Galaxy Note, I have tried four cases and three different types of belt clips and ended up ticked off and aggravated each time. Until the Cellet Executive Case. This thing looks good and actually works! First the Note slides into the case from the top and it fits as it should. Then the flap of the case folds down over the top - preventing the phone from falling out if the case is upended.<br /><br /> Secondly the case snaps closed with an actual snap instead of a magnet on the bottom - securely holding your phone inside the case where it belongs. Third - the top flap is elevated just a bit so that when it's snapped closed the top part does not scratch your phone screen - even with something tucked into the packet of the flap. I still use a screen protector, but the spacing is a nice perk with this case. There is a tiny little loop on the outside edge of the case where you could attach a cord (like you would on a camera).<br /><br />Fourth - the belt clip is built into the case rather than an after thought add on. It is also stitched on, so one can assume it should stay in place with regular use. Two full days of use and the belt clip has held my Note nicely in place on my hip while out at the barn working with the horses - the last two I tried both failed and broke within hours! The leather on the case is smooth and looks good - there is a light saddle tan color on the inside that contrasts very nicely with the black exterior. The cutouts for the camera, S-Pen, speaker and volume buttons are all placed correctly and do not interfer with normal use of the phone's features. My only complaint is that the power button cutout slightly overlaps the actual power button, so you have to push through a tiny sliver of leather - not a big deal at all in the general overview. Certainly not enough of a problem to warrant a star deduction.<br /><br />On a humorous note - the first day using this case had my Mother laughing out loud. Apparently flipping the top back to use the phone reminded her of the old Tri-corders from the original Star Trek. Now...admittedly, I am a total Sci-Fi geek, so this does have a certain appeal. I am ordering a second one of these cases as a back up for the future.

Excellent value for the price.<br /><br />**edit** The vendor states that the case allows wireless (Qi) charging - I didn’t find that to be true.

3.0,Jabra Freeway is very sleek; VoiceAssist is great!,"The Jabra Freeway is very sleek and comes with a free and optional one-year subscription to VoiceAssist.<br /><br />Setting the unit up was easy.<br />1. Before I could use the Jabra Freeway, I charged it for two hours using the supplied USB cable with car charger.<br />2. Next I made sure the cell phone was Bluetooth-enabled and turned on the Jabra unit.<br />3. It immediately went into pairing mode.  As it is pairing with the phone device, the prompts on the phone needed to be followed and the supplied security code had to be entered (not everyone will have to enter a security code; it depends on the phone)<br />4. After this I began making and answering calls using voice commands, checking the battery power of the unit, etc.  To make a call, I had to press the Voice button to wake up the unit and say ""phone commands.""  If I was unsure of how to speak to the unit I would say ""What can I say?"" and it would give me options.<br /><br />What I found very frustrating was:<br />1. Once I was done with a call, ending the call is not hands free.  I couldn't say ""hang-up, or cancel, or end"" because that doesn't work.  Instead I had to press the ""answer end button"" (which is the ""phone icon"" on the Jabra device) or end the call via the phone end button.<br />2. I also disliked having to press the Voice button every time I wanted to make a call because this meant it was not totally hands free.  The only hands free part is if someone is calling you, the unit then automatically awakes and you can tell it to ""answer"" or ""ignore"" the incoming call.<br />3. Many times I asked the unit to make a call.  Twice it brought up the EZ tip calculator, once it brought up the one-minute beep ""application,"" and another time it brought up some other application on the phone that I didn't ask for.  Another time I tried to call someone and instead it brought up the address book and rambled off both the mobile and work number without giving me the option to dial either one.<br /><br />What I really loved was the optional VoiceAssist package even though I had difficulty getting this set up because the code to redeem the free one-year subscription was hidden underneath a sticker either Amazon or the manufacturer put on the box.  However, VoiceAssist has the best live customer service around.  In fact we called each other almost five times to get this situation resolved in a few hours. Hopefully, new purchasers won't have this experience where the offer code is hidden between stickers and impossible to read even after being held up to the light.<br /><br />Below are the steps I took to get VoiceAssist to work:<br />1. I had to first redeem the free offer code on the box by going to [....].<br />2. Once signed in online to [....],  I imported all my Gmail contacts into the VoiceAssist application and also set up a connection to my review_maven twitter account ([....]).<br />3. Once registered and after I cleaned up the Gmail import which had about an 85% accuracy rate, I then needed to program the number of 949-257-0923 under the name of VoiceAssist into the Bluetooth phone.<br />4. After this I had a lot of fun:<br />  -  I used the Jabra unit to call VoiceAssist.<br />  - Once connected I used another set of VoiceAssist commands to ""call"" people in my contact list (they had to have a phone # in the Gmail contact listed that was imported), to ""post to Twitter,"" to ""read my e-mail"" on Gmail--which it read very well (except it said it couldn't read the pictures), and to send an email, which it sent okay though some of my message was garbled.  However, since an MP3 was attached to the email, the person receiving it could play that to get the full message.<br />  - The two posts to my Twitter account were okay, buy it got VoiceAssist wrong and typed voices instead and it typed Jabra as Java. You can look on the review_maven account to see the posts for May 28. 2011.<br /><br />I didn't have the phone functionality to try the FM Transmitter or play music features of the Jabra device.<br /><br />Below are some of the key features that I liked and some things I disliked:<br /><br /> PROS:<br />1. The Jabra unit is pretty easy to set up<br />2. The Jabra Freeway has a long battery life (about 14 to 17 hours)<br />3. You can pair two Bluetooth phones to the device with the last phone paired being the primary one<br />4. Jabra Freeway comes with a car charger for charging in your vehicle or with a 12Volt Battery Pack; the USB cable that is used to plug in the car adapter can be used without the adapter for charging with your PC<br />5. A free one-year subscription to VoiceAssist is supplied with purchase<br />6. Voice Assist understands commands better than the Jabra unit itself<br />7. I could check and send email and post to Twitter with VoiceAssist (Posting to Facebook is also possible.)<br />8. VoiceAssist provides SUPERB customer service.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1. VoiceAssist setup was difficult and the instructions that came with the device did not tell you to program in the telephone number to VoiceAssist.  Instead the Jabra instructions tell you to call VoiceAssist making you assume it's already pre-programed in the device.<br />2. Managing your contacts online in the VoiceAssist web site is somewhat cumbersome as the tool is in its infancy. For instance, every time I edited one of my 100+ contacts it kept going back to the first one after I saved the edit--then I had to scroll through the entire list again to go back to where I wanted to in the contact list.<br />3. Answer/End button is not intuitive on the Jabra unit (it's the phone icon on the Jabra Freeway); although the instructions do tell you where it's located.<br />4. The Jabra Freeway did not always understand my voice commands  Voice Assist understood my commands much better but  that still was not perfect)<br />5. Jabra is from the UK and only an automated help line is provided along with a website.  Other than this you can send an email and wait for a response--no live support here<br /><br />In summary, although Jabra will work with any Bluetooth phone, I did not feel I could get it to work exceptionally well with the Verizon LG phone I tried it with.  I cannot be sure whether it was because of my or my boyfriend's voices (as we both tried it), the phone, or just the functionality of the device.  Despite this, the Jabra Freeway is a very sleek unit and I felt that it responded better the more familiar I got with the device.  In addition, the other reviewers are raving about the Freeway.  Although VoiceAssist was not perfect, I absolutely loved that optional add-on.<br /><br />Updated May 30, 2011 - I sent an email to Jabra with two simple questions to see how responsive their email support was and I can tell you it's great.  I sent it over the weekend and got a response this morning.  The only thing that wasn't great was that one of my simple questions was answered wrong.  I had asked where the answer/end button was and according to the manual it is the phone icon on the Jabra device; however the reponse I got was to ""Slide the On/Off power switch to turn the speakerphone on or off"" so the question was either misunderstood or the tech did not know the answer. I think it's the former.<br /><br />Updated November 7, 2011 - I recommended this to a former colleague and this is what he said about the device verbatim. ""Regarding the Jabra device, it has worked very well.  I will admit, I have not used any of the advanced features much (other than initially playing with them) as honestly I have not needed them.  It has strictly been used as a straight bluetooth device and for that purpose it has worked extremely well.  The speaker quality is above and beyond competing devices and the functionality (recognizing bluetooth connections regularly, turning off when it doesn't detect a device, etc) are features that are useful and allow it to stick out from the pack of competing devices.  Overall, it has proven useful when I needed it.""",2011-05-29 00:30:14,417,False,jabra freeway sleek voiceassist great,jabra freeway sleek come free optional oneyear subscription voiceassistbr br

I can't recommend this at all. This is just plain crap. Loved it at first but couldn't even survive its first plug in on its first trip! Do not buy!<br /><br />I LOVE this little travel charger and it will from now go on all my travels with me. There is nothing worse than being in a new environment when you are away, mostly hotel rooms or on a cruise in your cabin, and you are not used to the layout and stumble around in the middle of the night trying to find the bathroom. Then you disturb the other person trying to sleep or worse hit your toes. With this travel charger you beat 2 birds with one stone. For one you always have a travel charger with you, but even better, it is a night light that allows you to have just a little light in the room that shows you where things are. It comes with 7 different lights so you can find the one that is the least annoying to you, I personally like the pink since it is not as bright as the white but still gives a lot of light).<br /><br />This charger is super easy to use and even better yet is a fast charger. Why anyone these days would even make a regular charger anymore is beyond me but you can still get those but thankfully this one is not one of them.

Use until ring becomes loose or adhesive begins to lift.<br />*  Replace with backups in the set by repeating above steps.<br /><br />Such a clever and simple little gadget that has made life easier and the added benefits for keeping my phone safe has made me all the more convinced- these should be built-in to all phones!! Should be noted: I place phone in a protective case and place holder on outside. Doing so keeps phone 100% free of any adhesive etc.<br /><br />Set priced under $10- is a solid find..

4.0,"Matte finish, faded over time","I purchased this anti-glare screen protector to give my screen a more ‘matte’ finish.  I thought it would look nicer and more unique than the standard glossy fingerprint-riddled surface.  It does feel like a strong protector, and it was very easy to install with the instructions and included sticker tools.  Do not expect a perfect installation, but if you take your time and use the stickers provided, you’ll get most of the dust off of the screen so that there are no bubbles.  I subtracted a star because the matte finish of the protector seems to have faded with use.  It might be the natural oils of my hands and face, but it is significant enough that I feel the product could be improved.  I’ve seen other matte screen protectors with a more porous surface which leads to a longer lasting finish.  Overall, does a great job to protect against scratches.

2.0,No fingerprint cutout?  For a Moto Stylus 5G??,"PROS:  The dark heavy rubber or plastic ""bumpers"" and edges on this case are great.  I especially like the snap in flaps for the input/output ports on the bottom.  The back and the front snap together firmly and the case itself feels fairly indestructible.<br /><br />CONS:  The Amazon listing says this is ""Designed for Moto G Stylus 5G.""  Now, why in the world Poetic would market this without a cut out on the back side to accommodate people who use the fingerprint scanner is beyond me.  Using an X-acto knife I cut out an oval to allow access to the scanner, but I shouldn't have had to do that.  Furthermore the heavy plastic on the back leaves gaping open spaces by not clinging to the surface --a sure attractor of dust and debris ..and moisture, should the phone be dropped in water or splashed.  Secondly, the clear screen protector on the front is little more than a heavy grade Saran-type plastic.  It seems cloudy and doesn't cling to the surface well, leaving MANY bubbles, streaks, etc.  I have friends whose phones are uglier looking than that, but it's more than I can put up with.  There's no way this moderately thick clear plastic could protect a glass surface from cracking or scratching, imho.<br /><br />I'm keeping this case for the time being, but will very likely replace it with an Otterbox and tempered glass in the future.  That video with the Poetic listing is certainly convincing, with the phone bouncing down steps, etc.  But be advised.",2021-11-18 19:47:12,17,True,fingerprint cutout moto stylus 5g,pro dark heavy rubber plastic bumper edge case great especially like snap flap inputoutput port bottom back front snap together firmly case feel fairly indestructiblebr br con amazon listing say designed moto g stylus 5g world poetic would market without cut back side accommodate people use fingerprint scanner beyond using xacto knife cut oval allow access scanner shouldnt furthermore heavy plastic back leaf gaping open space clinging surface sure attractor dust debris moisture phone dropped water splashed secondly clear screen protector front little heavy grade sarantype plastic seems cloudy doesnt cling surface well leaving many bubble streak etc friend whose phone uglier looking put there way moderately thick clear plastic could protect glass surface cracking scratching imhobr br im keeping case time likely replace otterbox tempered glass future video poetic listing certainly convincing phone bouncing step etc advised,fingerprint cutout moto stylus 5g pro dark heavy rubber plastic bumper edge case great especially like snap flap inputoutput port bottom back front snap together firmly case feel fairly indestructiblebr br con amazon listing say designed moto g stylus 5g world poetic would market without cut back side accommodate people use fingerprint scanner beyond using xacto knife cut oval allow access scanner shouldnt furthermore heavy plastic back leaf gaping open space clinging surface sure attractor dust debris moisture phone dropped water splashed secondly clear screen protector front little heavy grade sarantype plastic seems cloudy doesnt cling surface well leaving many bubble streak etc friend whose phone uglier looking put there way moderately thick clear plastic could protect glass surface cracking scratching imhobr br im keeping case time likely replace otterbox tempered glass future video poetic listing certainly convincing phone bouncing step etc advised,positive,2021,Screen Protector

1.0,Does not stay in place in vent (slips around),"I am very disappointed with this purchase. I had one like this without the ball joint, that did not move/articulate--just stayed in one place. It worked very well until after a couple of years the springs failed. I replaced it with this, thinking the ball joint would make it more useful, as it would move the phone about an inch closer to my fingertips and I could angle it as needed. In theory, this should have been a great car mount. In practice, it unfortunately fails, and here is why:<br /><br />The phone moves all over the place. If I tap the screen, my phone will tilt or turn. The ball joint is as tight as I can make it, and it still moves around a bit. However, the ball joint is not really the problem--the fingers that hold the entire thing into the vent are the problem. They do not grip the vanes in the vent strongly enough--it wiggles around all over the place. The ball joint will move a bit here and there, but really, it is movement at the connection to the vent point that is a problem. This was not a problem with the old one--the fingers of the vent holder were made of a grippier, rubber material than these. Simply put: these fingers slip, and the fingers on the one I replaced did not.<br /><br />I have ordered a replacement (another of the one I had before--$1.52 with free shipping--find it on here if you like), and it will take a month to get here from China, but it will be worth it. I plan on throwing this one away when the other arrives. I cannot recommend this item. Poorly executed.

5.0,An Exceptional Eye Cream (w/a strong rose scent),"I get a bit when a product says it will brighten skin. Years ago, my sister used a skin brightening cream under her eyes that made her look like a raccoon. lololol.  Thankfully, that doesn't happen with Alteya's Organic Eye Cream. I like the consistency of the cream; at first I thought it appeared to be a bit on the thicker side but that's not the case. Its nice and lightweight, VERY easy to apply (a little truly does go a LONG way!) and absorption is fast.  No greasy/oily look or feel is left behind.  Adds much needed moisture to the skin under and around my eyes, replaces dark circles /puffiness with some brightening while reducing fine lines and wrinkles.  It feels nice while being applied, as it absorbs and after absorption is completed. I have dry, sensitive skin and have no issues with the cream.<br /><br />There is a rose scent that I find to be very strong.  I'm not a fan of most things rose scented and that includes this cream. But it doesn't take very long before the scent is undetectable to me.<br /><br />I never heard of the Alteya brand before but now, I'm a huge fan of this eye cream.  I love the results it delivers and does so quickly.  The jar contains  0.51oz. I know that doesn't sound like much but I stress that VERY little cream is needed to adequately cover the area around the eyes. I use this twice a day , this jar will still last me a LONG time.  I find the price reasonable.

Not real leather but I didn't pay for real leather.<br />*Snaps and magnets seem strong.<br />*I'm able to handle my phone without it slipping out of my hand because the removable case is not slippery.<br />*The stylus is handy and works well. It's nice to be able to walk around with 1 clutch vs a wallet and a phone case.<br />*There are a lot of slots for storage with a huge clear panel for your license.<br /><br />Con:<br />*The finger activated security thingy opening on the back of the case is too small; so you have to take the removable case off to use this option. The potential for issue if you don't immidiately replace the case on the magnets is a bit concerning.<br />*It's a little bulkier than I expected. I find myself removing the case from the wallet portion often for easier handling - a thing I dont want to do when I'm out of the house.<br />*The charger port is also too small. I have to lift the phone out of the removable case to charge the phone. Annoying: I'm concerned about the potential for stretching the case over time and my phone falling out.<br />*There is no flip stand so if I want to watch videos on my phone, I have to prop my phone against whatever random object might be nearby.<br />*I don't know the name of the technology, but ive had phone cases that automatically sent the phone into sleep mode when I closed the case. This one doesn't have that tech so I need to make sure I send my phone to sleep before I close the case.<br /><br />I don't think I'll order this case again.

3.0,Port covers wear out after a few months,"Purchased 2 Otterbox Commuter Cases for both my husband's Razr Maxx and mine. Just received them.. and I got mine on without too much hassle. The inner rubber layer required a little wiggling to get the port protection flaps to lay just right and getting the phone (with the inner layer on) into the hard outer shell took a bit of coercing, but that proved to me that this case is fit perfectly for my phone, as described.<br /><br />The number one feature of this case that I absolutely love and appreciate is that the charging location is fully accessible *without* having to remove the case. I have had too many cases for other phones in the past which required the case be removed in order to charge the phone. I also like the company's warranty. I hope I never have to use it. but glad it's there for that unplanned catastrophic event. Thank you, Otterbox!<br /><br />I see this case serving as a wonderful protector for my expensive Razr Maxx for as long as I have it.. but I will update this review if any problems come up. From what I have experienced with my Otterbox Commuter Case so far.. I would highly recommend it mainly for the superb fit, charging access and the company's lifetime warranty.<br /><br />Update:<br />My husband and I have come to terms with our Otterbox cases. They are simply too thick and add too much bulk to an already sizable phone. Also, the silicone port covers/flaps have stopped seating properly and have began to tear off from the rest of the inner silicone liner (and this is without ever removing the case after first receiving it - so I know it is not caused by repeated installs and removals).. they pop out of place all the time when removing the phone from a purse or a holster which has lead to a noticeable amount of dust build up in the ports they were meant to protect.<br /><br />We have removed them from our phones and, after lengthy research and ordering multiple other cases, we have settled on the following cases as our replacements:<br /><br />Husband's Razr Maxx - [[ASIN:B007PPYXME Seidio BD2-HK3MTRMK-BK ACTIVE Combo with Metal Kickstand for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br />My Razr Maxx - [[ASIN:B007UNHTSG Seidio BD2-HK3MTRMK-PR ACTIVE Case and Holster Combo with Metal Kickstand for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Combo Pack - Retail Packaging - Amethyst]]<br /><br />I love that we were able to find suitable, and comparable, cases that are offered in a choice of colors. Something that I have been waiting for Otterbox to do, but it seems that they will have no plans of ever doing for any phone other than a very select few. This makes is possible to, at a glance, differentiate between our two otherwise identical phones.",2013-03-27 01:39:01,0,True,port cover wear month,purchased 2 otterbox commuter case husband razr maxx mine received got mine without much hassle inner rubber layer required little wiggling get port protection flap lay right getting phone inner layer hard outer shell took bit coercing proved case fit perfectly phone describedbr br number one feature case absolutely love appreciate charging location fully accessible without remove case many case phone past required case removed order charge phone also like company warranty hope never use glad unplanned catastrophic event thank otterboxbr br see case serving wonderful protector expensive razr maxx long update review problem come experienced otterbox commuter case far would highly recommend mainly superb fit charging access company lifetime warrantybr br updatebr husband come term otterbox case simply thick add much bulk already sizable phone also silicone port coversflaps stopped seating properly began tear rest inner silicone liner without ever removing case first receiving know caused repeated installs removal pop place time removing phone purse holster lead noticeable amount dust build port meant protectbr br removed phone lengthy research ordering multiple case settled following case replacementsbr br husband razr maxx asinb007ppyxme seidio bd2hk3mtrmkbk active combo metal kickstand motorola droid razr maxx retail packaging blackbr razr maxx asinb007unhtsg seidio bd2hk3mtrmkpr active case holster combo metal kickstand motorola droid razr maxx combo pack retail packaging amethystbr br love able find suitable comparable case offered choice color something waiting otterbox seems plan ever phone select make possible glance differentiate two otherwise identical phone,port cover wear month purchased 2 otterbox commuter case husband razr maxx mine received got mine without much hassle inner rubber layer required little wiggling get port protection flap lay right getting phone inner layer hard outer shell took bit coercing proved case fit perfectly phone describedbr br number one feature case absolutely love appreciate charging location fully accessible without remove case many case phone past required case removed order charge phone also like company warranty hope never use glad unplanned catastrophic event thank otterboxbr br see case serving wonderful protector expensive razr maxx long update review problem come experienced otterbox commuter case far would highly recommend mainly superb fit charging access company lifetime warrantybr br updatebr husband come term otterbox case simply thick add much bulk already sizable phone also silicone port coversflaps stopped seating properly began tear rest inner silicone liner without ever removing case first receiving know caused repeated installs removal pop place time removing phone purse holster lead noticeable amount dust build port meant protectbr br removed phone lengthy research ordering multiple case settled following case replacementsbr br husband razr maxx asinb007ppyxme seidio bd2hk3mtrmkbk active combo metal kickstand motorola droid razr maxx retail packaging blackbr razr maxx asinb007unhtsg seidio bd2hk3mtrmkpr active case holster combo metal kickstand motorola droid razr maxx combo pack retail packaging amethystbr br love able find suitable comparable case offered choice color something waiting otterbox seems plan ever phone select make possible glance differentiate two otherwise identical phone,positive,2013,Phone Case

1.0,disappointing!!!,"This is probably the worse phone I have ever had.  It is not user friendly at all. I have not downloaded many apps and do not use many apps. I don't use the bluetooth and only use data when I have wifi access.  I know this is not the galaxy 111 but based on the high ratings on Samsung phones I really expected better performance.  I just switched from a blackberry, but this is really disappointing.  Not even the basic features like making a call works well.  Its just two months and I really cannot put up with this for much longer.  Think I will go Iphone.<br /><br />Pros:  Nice size phone- attractive.<br /><br />cons:  The buttons on either side of the centre menu buttons do not light up and takes very long to respond when pressed.<br />  There is no way to cut off or end a call other than waiting until the touch screen pops up with the end button which takes quite a while after you have dialed - this has resulted in the<br />  person on the other end hearing me for at least 15 seconds after I think I have ended the calls.<br /><br />  Battery life started out really great for the 1st three weeks or so giving me at least 2 days without charging using wifi and apps.  Now - about 2 weeks later its down to less than a<br />  day- I have to charge daily.<br /><br />  The dual sim does not allow you to  pick which sim to call from - it has to be set on 1 at a time and to change you have to go to the settings options and change it.  I had dual sim phones before and when you dialed a number there was an option to choose which sim to dial from.  For incoming calls it automatically diverts the calls from the sim which is not set, to the sim which is set without the callers knowing that their call is going to another carrier.<br /><br />Difficult to store numbers in the phone book - in fact from time to time I am unable to access some numbers which I know were stored and I did not delete.<br /> contacts which were automatically stored as SNS cannot be edited.<br /><br />Sometimes you dial a number, and press call- it just diverts back to the main menu- this happens regularly now.<br /><br />The list goes on.....<br /><br />I definitely will not recommend this phone.",2013-04-04 14:40:20,17,True,disappointing,probably worse phone ever user friendly downloaded many apps use many apps dont use bluetooth use data wifi access know galaxy 111 based high rating samsung phone really expected better performance switched blackberry really disappointing even basic feature like making call work well two month really put much longer think go iphonebr br pro nice size phone attractivebr br con button either side centre menu button light take long respond pressedbr way cut end call waiting touch screen pop end button take quite dialed resulted thebr person end hearing least 15 second think ended callsbr br battery life started really great 1st three week giving least 2 day without charging using wifi apps 2 week later less abr day charge dailybr br dual sim allow pick sim call set 1 time change go setting option change dual sim phone dialed number option choose sim dial incoming call automatically diverts call sim set sim set without caller knowing call going another carrierbr br difficult store number phone book fact time time unable access number know stored deletebr contact automatically stored sn editedbr br sometimes dial number press call diverts back main menu happens regularly nowbr br list go onbr br definitely recommend phone,disappointing probably worse phone ever user friendly downloaded many apps use many apps dont use bluetooth use data wifi access know galaxy 111 based high rating samsung phone really expected better performance switched blackberry really disappointing even basic feature like making call work well two month really put much longer think go iphonebr br pro nice size phone attractivebr br con button either side centre menu button light take long respond pressedbr way cut end call waiting touch screen pop end button take quite dialed resulted thebr person end hearing least 15 second think ended callsbr br battery life started really great 1st three week giving least 2 day without charging using wifi apps 2 week later less abr day charge dailybr br dual sim allow pick sim call set 1 time change go setting option change dual sim phone dialed number option choose sim dial incoming call automatically diverts call sim set sim set without caller knowing call going another carrierbr br difficult store number phone book fact time time unable access number know stored deletebr contact automatically stored sn editedbr br sometimes dial number press call diverts back main menu happens regularly nowbr br list go onbr br definitely recommend phone,positive,2013,Phone Battery

1.0,The change to the phone is permanent.,"I was going to do a full review with pictures and even sample video but the FeiyuTech Vimble 3 really disappointed me.<br /><br />Firstly, I tried to pair this gimbal on three of my Android phones and none of them were able to pair.  In fact, it had a very odd problem.  On the first phone, I installed the Feiyu On app and attempted to pair the gimbal.  No devices were found.  In the phones bluetooth settings, I searched for bluetooth devices and saw a bunch of things around me but none of them were the gimbal.<br /><br />For sanity check, I checked the other two phones and they were able to see the gimbal in their bluetooth list, ready to pair.  I decided to give up on the first phone and moved on to the second phone.<br /><br />On my second phone, I installed the Feiyu On app and tried to pair.  Unable to find a device and after that, the device no longer showed up on the phones bluetooth list.  The app did something to the phone where it no longer sees the gimbal.<br /><br />Reluctantly, I decided to try on my daily driver.  The phone that I have in my pocket every day.  This time, I paired the gimbal through bluetooth first, then installed and launched the app.  The app found the gimbal but warned me not to pair it with the phone through the system's settings.  It let me connect anyway.  I took the opportunity to update the firmware on the gimbal but I really don't want to use my daily driver as the phone I want to use with this gimbal.<br /><br />So back to my other two phones.  Try as I might (reinitializing the gimbal and unpairing the bluetooth according to Feiyutech's FAQ page), the other two phones still wouldn't see the gimbal.  I even factory reset one of them.  The change to the phone is permanent!<br /><br />On my main phone, I decided to give up on the whole thing and unpair the gimbal and delete the app.  Guess what?  After unpairing, my main phone no longer sees the gimbal anymore.<br /><br />Something really fishy is going on.",2022-06-19 03:37:22,1,False,change phone permanent,going full review picture even sample video feiyutech vimble 3 really disappointed mebr br firstly tried pair gimbal three android phone none able pair fact odd problem first phone installed feiyu app attempted pair gimbal device found phone bluetooth setting searched bluetooth device saw bunch thing around none gimbalbr br sanity check checked two phone able see gimbal bluetooth list ready pair decided give first phone moved second phonebr br second phone installed feiyu app tried pair unable find device device longer showed phone bluetooth list app something phone longer see gimbalbr br reluctantly decided try daily driver phone pocket every day time paired gimbal bluetooth first installed launched app app found gimbal warned pair phone system setting let connect anyway took opportunity update firmware gimbal really dont want use daily driver phone want use gimbalbr br back two phone try might reinitializing gimbal unpairing bluetooth according feiyutechs faq page two phone still wouldnt see gimbal even factory reset one change phone permanentbr br main phone decided give whole thing unpair gimbal delete app guess unpairing main phone longer see gimbal anymorebr br something really fishy going,change phone permanent going full review picture even sample video feiyutech vimble 3 really disappointed mebr br firstly tried pair gimbal three android phone none able pair fact odd problem first phone installed feiyu app attempted pair gimbal device found phone bluetooth setting searched bluetooth device saw bunch thing around none gimbalbr br sanity check checked two phone able see gimbal bluetooth list ready pair decided give first phone moved second phonebr br second phone installed feiyu app tried pair unable find device device longer showed phone bluetooth list app something phone longer see gimbalbr br reluctantly decided try daily driver phone pocket every day time paired gimbal bluetooth first installed launched app app found gimbal warned pair phone system setting let connect anyway took opportunity update firmware gimbal really dont want use daily driver phone want use gimbalbr br back two phone try might reinitializing gimbal unpairing bluetooth according feiyutechs faq page two phone still wouldnt see gimbal even factory reset one change phone permanentbr br main phone decided give whole thing unpair gimbal delete app guess unpairing main phone longer see gimbal anymorebr br something really fishy going,positive,2022,Phone Holder

4.0,It’s good,"Looks just as pictured. The only issue I have with it is that the screen plastic doesn’t lay flush with the screen. In certain places it bows up which cause issues when typing. For me, the screen bows on the right part of the key board so when I need to use “L” or “M” or delete button I have to tap it several times, 4+ , for the screen to register that I’m trying to use that key. If I use swipe to text it’s different and works fine but it’s super annoying to have to type a key several types. I do also have a privacy screen protector on my screen so maybe with that and the built in screen plastic of the case it maybe too thick to type normally. I’m not sure. I’ve used my phone without this case but with the privacy screen and works as it should. With the case and the built in screen protector errors happen a lot and it’s frustrating.

5.0,Finally!!!,"Every place I've lived in the past decade or so has had terrible reception inside. I've been waiting for a product like this to make my cell phone work better at home.

The hardest part of the installation is finding the right spot for the outside antenna. Once you've mastered that, the rest is cake. I consistently only got a bar or two except for one spot in the house. This device made an immediate improvement. I don't get full bars, but it's enough to take calls and have people be able to actually hear me. If you should happen to need to contact customer service, they're excellent and very patient. If you don't have a landline at home, this is a good investment. I HIGHLY recommend this device.<br /><br />Thanks so much for taking the time to read this review.

5.0,A great fit for a great phone,"Let's face it- the V20 is not a small phone. For my wife, once you are carrying around something this big, it might as well also be a wallet/clutch. This case is great in that it holds a credit card and license and her phone conveniently so all her bases are covered.  The stylus pen is a nice add on, but not really so practical- we don't carry it around or use it. On a screen this big, you don't really need a stylus to pinpoint fine details on the display with your touch. It is nice that they throw it in, but the case is obviously what you buy this for.<br />Something to note: LG phones DO support magnetic auto-sleep and wake functions. But, very few cases are made to work with that. More specifically, some cases have a magnet in the fold on front that the phone can detect and automatically put it to sleep when closed. It will then auto wake when you open the flap (you can actually try this waving a fridge magnet over your screen if you want to see). This case does NOT do that, as none of the inexpensive cases seem to.<br />However, with the V20, you have the ""second screen"" which WILL sleep upon the proximity sensor detecting the flap is closed, and wake up when it sees the light again. So that's a nice touch, but all cases will do that. Meanwhile, you still need to manually wake the phone in this case by either double-tapping or pressing the power button / FP reader. This is something I was trying to find out about before hand but no one was mentioning, so hopefully this information helps the next person!",2019-08-12 20:07:56,0,True,great fit great phone,let face v20 small phone wife carrying around something big might well also walletclutch case great hold credit card license phone conveniently base covered stylus pen nice add really practical dont carry around use screen big dont really need stylus pinpoint fine detail display touch nice throw case obviously buy forbr something note lg phone support magnetic autosleep wake function case made work specifically case magnet fold front phone detect automatically put sleep closed auto wake open flap actually try waving fridge magnet screen want see case none inexpensive case seem tobr however v20 second screen sleep upon proximity sensor detecting flap closed wake see light thats nice touch case meanwhile still need manually wake phone case either doubletapping pressing power button fp reader something trying find hand one mentioning hopefully information help next person,great fit great phone let face v20 small phone wife carrying around something big might well also walletclutch case great hold credit card license phone conveniently base covered stylus pen nice add really practical dont carry around use screen big dont really need stylus pinpoint fine detail display touch nice throw case obviously buy forbr something note lg phone support magnetic autosleep wake function case made work specifically case magnet fold front phone detect automatically put sleep closed auto wake open flap actually try waving fridge magnet screen want see case none inexpensive case seem tobr however v20 second screen sleep upon proximity sensor detecting flap closed wake see light thats nice touch case meanwhile still need manually wake phone case either doubletapping pressing power button fp reader something trying find hand one mentioning hopefully information help next person,positive,2019,Phone Case

4.0,A good desk ring light,"Ring lights are an easy way to add some beauty lighting since the shadows are soft and round edged, and the catch light in your eyes has that signature circle shape. I've tried some cheap ones and some expensive ones before, usually the cheap ones didn't give consistent light and were too small, but this seems to be a good mid-range model that is more than adequate. The tripod it comes with is very sketchy, but still decent enough for a desktop. However the phone holder sort of throws off the balance and makes it hard to keep it set up without falling over.<br />I personally was interested in trying this to improve webcam / vblog lighting without my usual 3-point LED light setup. The nice thing about this is that it really is just one light and it gives a very flattering look compared other direct harsh lights or side lights.

5.0,"Comfy, stretchy, stylish","This band looks just like the photo and fits my Apple Watch 7 45mm perfectly.  It is adjustable and will fit thin and average wrists, but will have to stretch on big/thick wrists.  It may not be comfortable if you have huge wrists.  The metal clasp has a brushed finish (rather than high polish) which is nice because small scratches aren’t so noticeable.  The material is very stretchy (like a hairband almost) and comfortable.  Since it’s going to be stretching often as you wear/remove it, you might want to buy a second one if you like it.  Watch bands (except high quality solid metal) don’t last forever and even after only 1 year of normal wear my $100 Apple watch band (magnetic) looks very worn, and one of the connectors has broken.

5.0,"Economy model,  but still has ample space and accommodates a Note 3","I received this as a free review sample along with a more luxurious model. I am going to make a comparison between the two since they are the same brand. The other case is the [[ASIN:B00SKKHY4C Smartphone zipper wallet case, Belfen® [Handmade genuine leather] [Gray]Zipper Wallet Case]]. The dimensions of both are identical, but this one is a lighter duty case (in my opinion) and the outer finish appears to be a thin layer of genuine leather over a synthetic backing. That is not a criticism as much as an observation. The higher end case I mentioned has a better finish and construction.<br /><br />This will easily hold my Note 3 phone, which is fairly large. The pockets and holders provide a lot of space and this can be used to downsize from a full purse without having to give up room for essentials. I was able to fit my phone encased in a [[ASIN:B00ESAGVLK Bear Motion Genuine Lambskin Folio Case for Samsung Galaxy Note 3]] and have room to spare. I am not sure some of the more ruggedized cases will fit and did not one on hand to try. It will hold my phone and case, and an array of credit and ID cards, case and a small notepad with no issues. In fact there was room to spare after I tested it with those items.<br /><br />When you first unpack it there is a slight chemical odor, but it quickly goes away. Unlike the premium case I mentioned above the outer covering also had that odor, which is why I suspect it's a thin piece of real leather over a synthetic backing. Considering the much lower price of this case that makes sense. I do love the non-slip textured surface of this one over the premium case's surface, and most of the construction of this one is identical to the premium case: heavy-duty zipper affixed to a reinforced cloth that is, in turn, sandwiched between the outer leather and the synthetic interior parts. The inside zipper is lighter duty and this case has no wrist strap.<br /><br />Although this is a budget model compared to the other one this brand offers it's sturdy, roomy and very functional. It's also attractive and I would have no problem giving it as a gift. The women to whom I've shown it all said they liked it (a few loved it), and that is another reason why I gave it a high rating.",2015-04-30 07:29:34,0,False,economy model still ample space accommodates note 3,received free review sample along luxurious model going make comparison two since brand case asinb00skkhy4c smartphone zipper wallet case belfen handmade genuine leather grayzipper wallet case dimension identical one lighter duty case opinion outer finish appears thin layer genuine leather synthetic backing criticism much observation higher end case mentioned better finish constructionbr br easily hold note 3 phone fairly large pocket holder provide lot space used downsize full purse without give room essential able fit phone encased asinb00esagvlk bear motion genuine lambskin folio case samsung galaxy note 3 room spare sure ruggedized case fit one hand try hold phone case array credit id card case small notepad issue fact room spare tested itemsbr br first unpack slight chemical odor quickly go away unlike premium case mentioned outer covering also odor suspect thin piece real leather synthetic backing considering much lower price case make sense love nonslip textured surface one premium case surface construction one identical premium case heavyduty zipper affixed reinforced cloth turn sandwiched outer leather synthetic interior part inside zipper lighter duty case wrist strapbr br although budget model compared one brand offer sturdy roomy functional also attractive would problem giving gift woman ive shown said liked loved another reason gave high rating,economy model still ample space accommodates note 3 received free review sample along luxurious model going make comparison two since brand case asinb00skkhy4c smartphone zipper wallet case belfen handmade genuine leather grayzipper wallet case dimension identical one lighter duty case opinion outer finish appears thin layer genuine leather synthetic backing criticism much observation higher end case mentioned better finish constructionbr br easily hold note 3 phone fairly large pocket holder provide lot space used downsize full purse without give room essential able fit phone encased asinb00esagvlk bear motion genuine lambskin folio case samsung galaxy note 3 room spare sure ruggedized case fit one hand try hold phone case array credit id card case small notepad issue fact room spare tested itemsbr br first unpack slight chemical odor quickly go away unlike premium case mentioned outer covering also odor suspect thin piece real leather synthetic backing considering much lower price case make sense love nonslip textured surface one premium case surface construction one identical premium case heavyduty zipper affixed reinforced cloth turn sandwiched outer leather synthetic interior part inside zipper lighter duty case wrist strapbr br although budget model compared one brand offer sturdy roomy functional also attractive would problem giving gift woman ive shown said liked loved another reason gave high rating,positive,2015,Phone Case

4.0,decent case for the money,"I recently purchased the CANSHN Clear iPhone 12 Case/iPhone 12 Pro Case in the color purple and have been using it for a few weeks now. Overall, I have to say that I'm pretty satisfied with the case and would give it a solid 4 stars.<br /><br />One of the things that attracted me to this particular case was its military drop protection feature. I'm pretty clumsy and have dropped my phone more times than I care to admit, so I wanted a case that would give me some peace of mind in case of a mishap. So far, I haven't dropped my phone with this case on, but it definitely feels sturdy and well-made, so I'm confident it would hold up well in a fall.<br /><br />I also appreciate that the case hasn't yellowed yet. I've had clear cases in the past that have started to look dingy and discolored after just a few weeks of use, but this one still looks crystal clear. That being said, I do notice some smudges and fingerprints on the back of the case, which can be a bit annoying.<br /><br />The hard back and soft TPU bumpers provide good protection, but I do wish the case was a little thicker or had a more substantial feel to it. It's quite slim and lightweight, which is nice for carrying in my pocket, but it doesn't give me as much confidence in its protection abilities as some bulkier cases might.<br /><br />All in all, I think this is a solid case for the price. It offers good protection, doesn't yellow, and looks nice on my phone. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a clear case that provides some added drop protection.",2023-03-13 17:26:46,0,False,decent case money,recently purchased canshn clear iphone 12 caseiphone 12 pro case color purple using week overall say im pretty satisfied case would give solid 4 starsbr br one thing attracted particular case military drop protection feature im pretty clumsy dropped phone time care admit wanted case would give peace mind case mishap far havent dropped phone case definitely feel sturdy wellmade im confident would hold well fallbr br also appreciate case hasnt yellowed yet ive clear case past started look dingy discolored week use one still look crystal clear said notice smudge fingerprint back case bit annoyingbr br hard back soft tpu bumper provide good protection wish case little thicker substantial feel quite slim lightweight nice carrying pocket doesnt give much confidence protection ability bulkier case mightbr br think solid case price offer good protection doesnt yellow look nice phone would recommend anyone looking clear case provides added drop protection,decent case money recently purchased canshn clear iphone 12 caseiphone 12 pro case color purple using week overall say im pretty satisfied case would give solid 4 starsbr br one thing attracted particular case military drop protection feature im pretty clumsy dropped phone time care admit wanted case would give peace mind case mishap far havent dropped phone case definitely feel sturdy wellmade im confident would hold well fallbr br also appreciate case hasnt yellowed yet ive clear case past started look dingy discolored week use one still look crystal clear said notice smudge fingerprint back case bit annoyingbr br hard back soft tpu bumper provide good protection wish case little thicker substantial feel quite slim lightweight nice carrying pocket doesnt give much confidence protection ability bulkier case mightbr br think solid case price offer good protection doesnt yellow look nice phone would recommend anyone looking clear case provides added drop protection,positive,2023,Phone Case

The color is one of her favorite colors and she loves how sleek and thin the cases yet sturdy enough for her to trust that her phone is protected.<br /><br />I would suggest buying a quality screen protector since the size of the case are not very deep. This is the only drawback or negative that I have to say about the case. I am used to having an OtterBox case that has deeper edges so if the phone is dropped screen side down it’s less likely to impact the ground or scratch the screen.

5.0,Love it!,"I finally got an iPhone and this was the first brand of screen protection I purchased for it.  A few days before it arrived, I got an e-mail from the company and had a link to videos on how to apply it to the phone.  It was extremely helpful.  I was able to put a new screen protector on my husband's iPhone (the old screen protector had quite a few bubbles) and I managed to almost have it perfect.  There were some very small bubbles but they weren't on the screen so he didn't mind.  He also liked the way it doesn't leave fingerprints.  I applied one to my iPhone and I had one bubble due to a spec of dust.  Even so, it was hardly noticeable.  I was going to leave it but I'm kind of OCD so I used my last one and that one I got PERFECT.  No bubbles at all.  The only con I have with it is that viewing pictures aren't as sharp anymore but at the cost of not having to clean the screen every five minutes, I can live with it.  Other than that, I absolutely love it and would recommend it to others.

Every truck show, every tractor show, every time the grands are around, and all the weird bugs... he has pics - lol. And his iPhone 6 (8GB! Lol) ran into a conundrum: It was full of photos, so it didn't have space for his updates. And because it couldn't update, he couldn't upload his photos to the cloud. Also, he wanted a bigger screen. (I'm the same, why put on glasses when you can just have a bigger screen 🤷🏼‍♀️).<br /><br />I honestly thought that the 'swipe the screen away' feature - replacing the home button - would drive him up the wall. He hasn't said a word! (BEEEEELIEVE me... he's at that wonderful, fully liberated age where he says whatever he thinks and does 👊🏻 not 👊🏻 care). He truly loves this phone!

4.0,"Pushing it for larger phones, but for many phones it's ideal","I received a review sample and put it to the test. First, please read and heed Comdet's helpful April 6, 2014 review because some of the limitation cited are valid if you have a phone the size of a Samsung Galaxy Note II or larger. For iPhones or phones of similar size this holder does work well.<br /><br />My test with a Samsung Galaxy Note 3 indicates that not only is this a tight fit, but getting the phone into the jaws of the clamp was an exercise in frustration. Like Comdet mentioned, when I had the clamps at the last adjustment stop, opening the spring loaded jaw further to fit the Note 3 would disengage the jaw from the adjustment stop. If you remember what flypaper is, this cycle of events is akin to unsticking that stuff. The more you tried, the more frustrating it is.<br /><br />On the other hand, an iPhone 5S fit the clamp as though they were designed for each other and this product was transformed from a mechanical demon to an absolute joy to use. Among the reasons why it was a joy with the smaller phones are the protective strips on the sides of the clamp (the blue areas in the photos) that ensure your phone will not be marred or scratched. Another reason why I love this for the smaller phones is the suction cup holds strongly, even on the pebble-grained dashboard in my vehicle. And finally, the ability to swivel the phone to just about any conceivable angle adds a lot of convenience.  Some holders that I have tested were limited in viewing angle, so this one is a step ahead of that group.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you own a phone the size of a Note II or Note 3, look elsewhere because while this one will work, it's too much trouble in my opinion. If you own a smaller phone this one merits five stars and your consideration.",2014-04-08 10:56:06,1,False,pushing larger phone many phone ideal,received review sample put test first please read heed comdets helpful april 6 2014 review limitation cited valid phone size samsung galaxy note ii larger iphones phone similar size holder work wellbr br test samsung galaxy note 3 indicates tight fit getting phone jaw clamp exercise frustration like comdet mentioned clamp last adjustment stop opening spring loaded jaw fit note 3 would disengage jaw adjustment stop remember flypaper cycle event akin unsticking stuff tried frustrating isbr br hand iphone 5 fit clamp though designed product transformed mechanical demon absolute joy use among reason joy smaller phone protective strip side clamp blue area photo ensure phone marred scratched another reason love smaller phone suction cup hold strongly even pebblegrained dashboard vehicle finally ability swivel phone conceivable angle add lot convenience holder tested limited viewing angle one step ahead groupbr br bottom line phone size note ii note 3 look elsewhere one work much trouble opinion smaller phone one merit five star consideration,pushing larger phone many phone ideal received review sample put test first please read heed comdets helpful april 6 2014 review limitation cited valid phone size samsung galaxy note ii larger iphones phone similar size holder work wellbr br test samsung galaxy note 3 indicates tight fit getting phone jaw clamp exercise frustration like comdet mentioned clamp last adjustment stop opening spring loaded jaw fit note 3 would disengage jaw adjustment stop remember flypaper cycle event akin unsticking stuff tried frustrating isbr br hand iphone 5 fit clamp though designed product transformed mechanical demon absolute joy use among reason joy smaller phone protective strip side clamp blue area photo ensure phone marred scratched another reason love smaller phone suction cup hold strongly even pebblegrained dashboard vehicle finally ability swivel phone conceivable angle add lot convenience holder tested limited viewing angle one step ahead groupbr br bottom line phone size note ii note 3 look elsewhere one work much trouble opinion smaller phone one merit five star consideration,positive,2014,Phone Holder

5.0,Ideal for dual devices in your vehicle,"I received a review sample and was immediately impressed with the overall quality of the charger and cable.

Each end has a strain relief and the cable itself is heavy-duty. The Lightning and USB connectors mate perfectly with their respective ports.<br /><br />A key feature for me is the charger includes built-in protection against overcharging. Another feature is these chargers will accept 12 to 18 volts DC input and maintain a steady 5 volts DC output on each port.Since the rated capacity of each of the two chargers is 3.1A total (1.0 for a phone and 2.1 for tablets) this will simultaneously charge both devices (or two phones if you are traveling with a passenger.<br /><br />This kit also ships with a clear adhesive non-slip mat that you can affix to your dashboard to sit your phone on.

3.0,"No bubbles, partial screen coverage, lines","Overall, I this was a MEH screen protector in my opinion - BUT still better than the last 3 screen protectors I've bought.  It has a good installation video guide, and I was able to install it with zero bubbles on my first try.  I think most people (who actually *watch* the video and follow their method) can do it, too.  However, I'm disappointed in the ugly lines near the middle third of the screen - check out the attached photo to see what I mean.  You will see those same lines with almost all of the other plastic film style protectors, though, to be fair.  The other thing I'm disappointed in is that this doesn't cover the whole screen - you can see the edges on each side are not covered.  This film is simply smaller than the 45mm screen by at least a few mm on each side.  You can see how much smaller it is in the photo.  When you are swiping from the side, to change your watch face, for example, you feel that annoying edge of the film.  I'm not sure why it's so hard for companies to make a film that fits the watch, but it certainly doesn't feel like 2022 when it comes to watch screen protectors.  The only one that was a close fit for the screen had a thick black border that actually covers the edges of the screen, and was impossible to install without bubbles.  Don't buy that one!<br /><br />Anyway, this film protector is better than nothing, for sure, especially if you wear your watch to the gym or anywhere where it can be scratched.  Remember - only the high end ($1000ish) apple watches have the sapphire screens - not all models.  So unless you have that model, your screen will almost definitely scratch without a screen protector.",2022-01-29 04:44:49,3,True,bubble partial screen coverage line,overall meh screen protector opinion still better last 3 screen protector ive bought good installation video guide able install zero bubble first try think people actually watch video follow method however im disappointed ugly line near middle third screen check attached photo see mean see line almost plastic film style protector though fair thing im disappointed doesnt cover whole screen see edge side covered film simply smaller 45mm screen least mm side see much smaller photo swiping side change watch face example feel annoying edge film im sure hard company make film fit watch certainly doesnt feel like 2022 come watch screen protector one close fit screen thick black border actually cover edge screen impossible install without bubble dont buy onebr br anyway film protector better nothing sure especially wear watch gym anywhere scratched remember high end 1000ish apple watch sapphire screen model unless model screen almost definitely scratch without screen protector,bubble partial screen coverage line overall meh screen protector opinion still better last 3 screen protector ive bought good installation video guide able install zero bubble first try think people actually watch video follow method however im disappointed ugly line near middle third screen check attached photo see mean see line almost plastic film style protector though fair thing im disappointed doesnt cover whole screen see edge side covered film simply smaller 45mm screen least mm side see much smaller photo swiping side change watch face example feel annoying edge film im sure hard company make film fit watch certainly doesnt feel like 2022 come watch screen protector one close fit screen thick black border actually cover edge screen impossible install without bubble dont buy onebr br anyway film protector better nothing sure especially wear watch gym anywhere scratched remember high end 1000ish apple watch sapphire screen model unless model screen almost definitely scratch without screen protector,positive,2022,Screen Protector

5.0,Glad I Didn't Get the Galaxy 5!,"I am flat-out in love with this phone. We had gone into the Verizon store intending to get Samsung Galaxy 5 phones, but they were offering this phone for ""free"" (with 2-year renewal, of course) and when the representative heard we were looking for good battery life she recommended the Droid Turbo. We started out with Droid phones for our first smartphone, and we really liked them. These were upgraded to a Galaxy Nexus; our first two were so bad (husband's rebooted constantly, and mine kept locking up) we had to return them for replacements. The Galaxy Nexus was a useful phone, but it ate battery way out of proportion of what I did with it. We had to have two spare batteries just to get through a long day at a SF convention.<br /><br />But I've never been ""in love"" with a phone until this Turbo. The battery life isn't what the specs say, but I can play podcasts all day, check the weather, send texts, make calls, use Waze and still have battery life at the end of the day without having to charge it; sometimes it doesn't go under 50 percent. That is downright amazing compared to the old Nexus. I love the Moto Voice feature in which you address the phone with a customized pass phrase and it will call someone on your contact list, look up the temperature outside, post to Facebook, and/or feed you the headlines. The screen is absolutely gorgeous; from photographs on Facebook to YouTube videos to the icons on your screen, the picture is sharp-edged and brilliant with vivid colors. The response time is quick. The camera isn't bad at all, except for a slightly slow response time, and I frequenly find myself leaving my camera behind for small parties and close-up photography because the phone app does the job so well. Sound is good considering it's a phone and I can finally hear it; I could turn the Nexus up to full volume and still not be able to make out what was being said.<br /><br />As far as I can tell, there's nothing this phone can't do, or I haven't run into it yet.",2015-01-26 15:19:33,5,False,glad didnt get galaxy 5,flatout love phone gone verizon store intending get samsung galaxy 5 phone offering phone free 2year renewal course representative heard looking good battery life recommended droid turbo started droid phone first smartphone really liked upgraded galaxy nexus first two bad husband rebooted constantly mine kept locking return replacement galaxy nexus useful phone ate battery way proportion two spare battery get long day sf conventionbr br ive never love phone turbo battery life isnt spec say play podcasts day check weather send text make call use waze still battery life end day without charge sometimes doesnt go 50 percent downright amazing compared old nexus love moto voice feature address phone customized pas phrase call someone contact list look temperature outside post facebook andor feed headline screen absolutely gorgeous photograph facebook youtube video icon screen picture sharpedged brilliant vivid color response time quick camera isnt bad except slightly slow response time frequenly find leaving camera behind small party closeup photography phone app job well sound good considering phone finally hear could turn nexus full volume still able make saidbr br far tell there nothing phone cant havent run yet,glad didnt get galaxy 5 flatout love phone gone verizon store intending get samsung galaxy 5 phone offering phone free 2year renewal course representative heard looking good battery life recommended droid turbo started droid phone first smartphone really liked upgraded galaxy nexus first two bad husband rebooted constantly mine kept locking return replacement galaxy nexus useful phone ate battery way proportion two spare battery get long day sf conventionbr br ive never love phone turbo battery life isnt spec say play podcasts day check weather send text make call use waze still battery life end day without charge sometimes doesnt go 50 percent downright amazing compared old nexus love moto voice feature address phone customized pas phrase call someone contact list look temperature outside post facebook andor feed headline screen absolutely gorgeous photograph facebook youtube video icon screen picture sharpedged brilliant vivid color response time quick camera isnt bad except slightly slow response time frequenly find leaving camera behind small party closeup photography phone app job well sound good considering phone finally hear could turn nexus full volume still able make saidbr br far tell there nothing phone cant havent run yet,positive,2015,Phone Battery

5.0,"great long cord- gives you freedom of movement, or just more options","I love this TEN FOOT USB C cord. When my husband and I bought Google Pixel 3XL phones, we went from micro USB charging cords to USB C. I knew that I wanted at least 6 foot charging cords, as where we have our plug in stations, the additional length is really nice to have- especially at the bedside. I can charge and be able to still play on my phone while laying in bed, comfortably.<br /><br />It is a nice looking cord, it looks and feels like quality. I haven't any issues thus far. I have used it with a wall charger, I have used it in a wall receptacle that has USB port, I have used it plugged into my computer. I will likely keep it in my bedroom, and get another for use at my computer. I like having the extra length to my cord as sometimes I take pics while it is plugged in. Say, I have taken pics for review purpose, then while transferring pics to computer I think of other pics I want to take. I can keep it all connected- take more pics- and be able to easily transfer my pics without taking additional steps. It is a little thing, but a big thing in terms of time saving. Of course, I could just take all the pics I need before connecting phone to computer, but that doesn't always happen.

4.0,Works!,"After we upgraded our vehicle we found that we couldn't use our old phone mount as our new(er) car doesn't have a CD player that's open. I was always wary of getting these vent mounts as I wasn't sure how the heat or AC would affect the phone, but alas this seemed the best option for our current car. The dash isn't as flat to accommodate a dash mount, so this will have to do.<br /><br />So far it fits my Note8 and my wife's Xr (both with Otterboxes) just fine. I'm able to take it off and put it on with ease. What I really like is that the release button is in the back; with our previous one, the release button was on the side. This meant that, if you had bigger phones, it was a bit awkward to take out. Not so with this mount.<br /><br />The clip holding on the vent loosened once so far. I retightened it and it seems very sturdy now, but I will wait and see.<br /><br />You have to assemble it when it arrives, but if you used multiple mounts in the past it's just like the others: just pop the socket onto the ball joint and tighten it.

5.0,"perfect power bank for my needs, comes with protective case, cords, good instructions","I don't know much about power banks of this size, but I know I needed one. I basically wanted to make sure it had enough oomph to take care of my tablet or lap top as needed. I looked at bunch of these before finally deciding on this one. The description just had enough information to make me comfortable ordering this one even though so many looked and sounded similar. Price point was in range, too. If I wanted more features, then the price goes way up. I basically knew what I needed this for, and the worked from there. Not bad for a newb. :D<br /><br />So far, I think it has been a great choice. I am happy with it. It took some getting used to as it was so new to me, but the included instructions are good. And I can come back here for more info too. I am kind of new to power banks of this size, but I needing something to keep my old tablet going (and occasionally lap top or phone). My tablet  doesn't hold a charge for long, and I am not always in a spot that has an outlet for me to charge it up. I can pack up this bank, and take it wherever I find myself working. There are plenty of additional options- USB, USB C, regular plug in. I like that I can see how much charge is left on the power bank, and I can see how far along it is when I am charging it back up. No guessing!!! That really helps me.<br /><br />It comes with a durable soft ""hard case"". It zips up, and it has a mesh pocket for keeping cord and instructions organized.

5.0,Nice for the price,"PLEASE SEE  UPDATE/CORRECTIONS  I was pleasantly surprised.  I am still not sure if I like my Captivate in this color but this definitely a nice case. It does not interfere with the keyboard at all, and fit perfectly.  It is worth the money.  I would be paying twice the price for it or anything but for this price, a nice deal.  The shipping was very fast from eForCity (NO apparently purchase was not eforcity and it was good see later comments) and it was just a padded envelope but really, this is just a little bit of plastic, who needs more packaging?  Oh, I just happened to have cut myself quite badly earlier in the day and well, had a bandaid that was not holding back the tide anymore. To make a long story short, got blood on the case as I was putting it on the phone and figured well that was the end of that, but hey, blood wiped right off with a little windex.  Not too shabby.  At this price I might order a second to have on hand but still have to think about how I like my phone White.<br /><br />Well, after two days, I noticed the white phone I now loved had awful black streaks.  They were being caused by my walmart purse lining.  Oh well, nothing I tried in the way of cleaners took them off so I was determined to find a new purse or line the old purse with something white because I LOVED my phone in the white case.  Well, I decided to line the purse with some white interface iron stuff but in the meantime ordered two more white cases.  Well, I thought I ordered the from the same place, same case,etc.  Was badly disappointed.  The vendor for eforcity case, err, EFORCITY, sent me two pieces of garbage.  They were stiff, cheap, brittle, rough edge plastic that did not fit my phone and had different cutouts from the previous rubberized case I loved.  I emailed them, showed them pics and did get a refund.  However, I am still left with just my poor black streaked eforcity white rubberized case now.  Going to try mr clean magic eraser on it this weekend.  Darn, I LOVE this case and didn't want anything to happen to it.<br /><br />But BEWARE, if your case doesn't have a great big cutout for  camera/flash/speaker instead of a tiny hole, it is hard plastic that is inferior to this excellent rubberized stuff with a custom fit. Accept no substitutions.<br /><br />More UPDATE: which I should have done before this.  OK, some items you have to be careful of when you order if you really liked the last order that you are ordering from the same vendor.  I did so love this white case.  Unfortunately, my cheap wallyworld purse lining stained the heck out of it to black grimy dirty that apparently nothing can clean. No, Mr clean magic erasers didn't work either.  I was distraught.  Looked into other purses and lining the current black one to keep my phone case, WHITE.  Well, in the meantime I ordered two more of what I THOUGHT was the same case, right from here, the link to the original one ordered.  Anyhow, long story short, I had to go to another website/search engine to find what I originally bought here.  And yes, if you find the big hole one it is the genuine article and will fit your captivate fine.  Just be very careful of where you put it, even a dark denim pocket in your jeans, etc is likely to stain it.  A shame, it is a wonderful case, so nice in white but too easy to stain.",2013-05-20 00:33:16,1,True,nice price,please see updatecorrections pleasantly surprised still sure like captivate color definitely nice case interfere keyboard fit perfectly worth money would paying twice price anything price nice deal shipping fast eforcity apparently purchase eforcity good see later comment padded envelope really little bit plastic need packaging oh happened cut quite badly earlier day well bandaid holding back tide anymore make long story short got blood case putting phone figured well end hey blood wiped right little windex shabby price might order second hand still think like phone whitebr br well two day noticed white phone loved awful black streak caused walmart purse lining oh well nothing tried way cleaner took determined find new purse line old purse something white loved phone white case well decided line purse white interface iron stuff meantime ordered two white case well thought ordered place caseetc badly disappointed vendor eforcity case err eforcity sent two piece garbage stiff cheap brittle rough edge plastic fit phone different cutout previous rubberized case loved emailed showed pic get refund however still left poor black streaked eforcity white rubberized case going try mr clean magic eraser weekend darn love case didnt want anything happen itbr br beware case doesnt great big cutout cameraflashspeaker instead tiny hole hard plastic inferior excellent rubberized stuff custom fit accept substitutionsbr br update done ok item careful order really liked last order ordering vendor love white case unfortunately cheap wallyworld purse lining stained heck black grimy dirty apparently nothing clean mr clean magic eraser didnt work either distraught looked purse lining current black one keep phone case white well meantime ordered two thought case right link original one ordered anyhow long story short go another websitesearch engine find originally bought yes find big hole one genuine article fit captivate fine careful put even dark denim pocket jean etc likely stain shame wonderful case nice white easy stain,nice price please see updatecorrections pleasantly surprised still sure like captivate color definitely nice case interfere keyboard fit perfectly worth money would paying twice price anything price nice deal shipping fast eforcity apparently purchase eforcity good see later comment padded envelope really little bit plastic need packaging oh happened cut quite badly earlier day well bandaid holding back tide anymore make long story short got blood case putting phone figured well end hey blood wiped right little windex shabby price might order second hand still think like phone whitebr br well two day noticed white phone loved awful black streak caused walmart purse lining oh well nothing tried way cleaner took determined find new purse line old purse something white loved phone white case well decided line purse white interface iron stuff meantime ordered two white case well thought ordered place caseetc badly disappointed vendor eforcity case err eforcity sent two piece garbage stiff cheap brittle rough edge plastic fit phone different cutout previous rubberized case loved emailed showed pic get refund however still left poor black streaked eforcity white rubberized case going try mr clean magic eraser weekend darn love case didnt want anything happen itbr br beware case doesnt great big cutout cameraflashspeaker instead tiny hole hard plastic inferior excellent rubberized stuff custom fit accept substitutionsbr br update done ok item careful order really liked last order ordering vendor love white case unfortunately cheap wallyworld purse lining stained heck black grimy dirty apparently nothing clean mr clean magic eraser didnt work either distraught looked purse lining current black one keep phone case white well meantime ordered two thought case right link original one ordered anyhow long story short go another websitesearch engine find originally bought yes find big hole one genuine article fit captivate fine careful put even dark denim pocket jean etc likely stain shame wonderful case nice white easy stain,positive,2013,Phone Case

2.0,"Great, but maybe try the longer one for Pixel XL (update: dead)","Update 6/27/21<br />Charger stopped working this past week while on a trip. Just out of the blue, worked great every day for months and then just stopped. Charging pad indicates that it knows there but has an error (blinking light instead of solid light), and none of the portable wireless chargers (battery packs and my car charger) work with it anymore. Disappointed, it barely lasted 3 months.<br />Original review:<br />I got this to use with my wife's Pixel 3a XL, which lacks wireless charging.<br />Happy to say it works, even inside of a wallet case (although I need to pull some of the glue off the back of the wallet case to make it fit- best position seems to be in between the wallet material and the TPU case inside. If placed in the TPU, there are just too many layers and a good connection can't be made reliably). But, I should have opted maybe for a longer cable version. This one places the charging area on the lower third of the phone, which successfully avoids the finger print reader but also makes the phone kind of lopsided on the charger. If placed in the middle of the charging pad, the charging area of this adapter is too off-center to get power. I eventually found a way to make it work for her (I have a long double- space charging pad, and dropping it on there in any orientation seems to make contact), but I needed to fiddle with it before we had a system that works. It is now pretty convenient, and unlike other charging pads I'd try in the past that were cheaper (here and on ebay), this one hasn't burnt out after a few charges.

5.0,Charges for Everyone!,"This is a cigarette lighter style plug. So, if you have the USB type plug already in your car, this isn't going to work. The one end plugs into the cigarette lighter (what do they even call those these days?) and then it has a longish cord and more USB plugs on the other end. This is supposed to be a front seat/back seat charger. However, I drive a bus (well, 12 passenger van) so it doesn't actually reach the furthest back seats. It does reach the bench right behind the driver, but no further than that. (Sorry to those on the back two rows.) You can plug up to 5 devices in at a time. With all 5 plugged in, charging is a bit slower. It does better with only one or two things plugged in. But if everything is dying all at once, plugging everything in is an option and it does charge them, just not quite as fast. In a normal size car, you would be able to plug your device or two in up front and then let the backseat passengers use the other end to plug in their devices. In an SUV or minivan, you can reach the middle row of seats, but the far back row would be a bit of a stretch, but could likely be done.",2017-08-17 16:51:14,0,False,charge everyone,cigarette lighter style plug usb type plug already car isnt going work one end plug cigarette lighter even call day longish cord usb plug end supposed front seatback seat charger however drive bus well 12 passenger van doesnt actually reach furthest back seat reach bench right behind driver sorry back two row plug 5 device time 5 plugged charging bit slower better one two thing plugged everything dying plugging everything option charge quite fast normal size car would able plug device two front let backseat passenger use end plug device suv minivan reach middle row seat far back row would bit stretch could likely done,charge everyone cigarette lighter style plug usb type plug already car isnt going work one end plug cigarette lighter even call day longish cord usb plug end supposed front seatback seat charger however drive bus well 12 passenger van doesnt actually reach furthest back seat reach bench right behind driver sorry back two row plug 5 device time 5 plugged charging bit slower better one two thing plugged everything dying plugging everything option charge quite fast normal size car would able plug device two front let backseat passenger use end plug device suv minivan reach middle row seat far back row would bit stretch could likely done,positive,2017,Screen Protector

5.0,Decent Flap Case for iPhone 13,"I had a case similar to this one for my iPhone 6 and I really came to appreciate it. It was convenient to have the necessary cards with my phone without having to carry a separate wallet. I wanted a similar case for my iPhone 13 and I found this one. It's not perfect but it answers the need I have and I am happy with it.<br /><br />This is a basic flap case with three card holder and one ID holder. It does add a little bulk to the phone when the phone is in it, but it still fits nicely in my pocket. Contact magnets keep the flap closed so nothing shakes loose.<br /><br />One of the features this case claims is RFID protection. I decided to test that on the card readers at work, which are very sensitive and can read my badge from over a foot away. With my badge in this case the reader could still scan it, but it had to be about 2"" from the sensor before it would pick up. That's on par with the large majority of RFID wallets I have tried. I have seen better, but I have also seen worse. For most people, this is sufficient protection for preventing scans from any practical distance.<br /><br />The case seems to be made well and I haven't noticed any problems with the material separating or being assembled incorrectly. Time will tell how well it holds up.<br /><br />The one area where I think this case could use some improvement is in the number of card pockets. It can hold only a total of 4 credit cards (or 3 + 1 ID card). That may be enough for some, but I need a couple more slots. Adding more would cause the case to add much more bulk, and the flap would not close either, so this is probably as close to perfect as I will find.<br /><br />As I write this, the asking price is about $20, which is reasonable.<br /><br />This is the type of phone case I wanted and it meets the need I have. It looks nice, it holds a few cards for me so I don't need to pack a separate wallet, and it offers basic RFID protection for those cards. The asking price is reasonable too. If you have an iPhone 13 and you want a case that can hold a couple of credit cards, this is one to consider.",2023-02-08 11:01:55,1,False,decent flap case iphone 13,case similar one iphone 6 really came appreciate convenient necessary card phone without carry separate wallet wanted similar case iphone 13 found one perfect answer need happy itbr br basic flap case three card holder one id holder add little bulk phone phone still fit nicely pocket contact magnet keep flap closed nothing shake loosebr br one feature case claim rfid protection decided test card reader work sensitive read badge foot away badge case reader could still scan 2 sensor would pick thats par large majority rfid wallet tried seen better also seen worse people sufficient protection preventing scan practical distancebr br case seems made well havent noticed problem material separating assembled incorrectly time tell well hold upbr br one area think case could use improvement number card pocket hold total 4 credit card 3 1 id card may enough need couple slot adding would cause case add much bulk flap would close either probably close perfect findbr br write asking price 20 reasonablebr br type phone case wanted meet need look nice hold card dont need pack separate wallet offer basic rfid protection card asking price reasonable iphone 13 want case hold couple credit card one consider,decent flap case iphone 13 case similar one iphone 6 really came appreciate convenient necessary card phone without carry separate wallet wanted similar case iphone 13 found one perfect answer need happy itbr br basic flap case three card holder one id holder add little bulk phone phone still fit nicely pocket contact magnet keep flap closed nothing shake loosebr br one feature case claim rfid protection decided test card reader work sensitive read badge foot away badge case reader could still scan 2 sensor would pick thats par large majority rfid wallet tried seen better also seen worse people sufficient protection preventing scan practical distancebr br case seems made well havent noticed problem material separating assembled incorrectly time tell well hold upbr br one area think case could use improvement number card pocket hold total 4 credit card 3 1 id card may enough need couple slot adding would cause case add much bulk flap would close either probably close perfect findbr br write asking price 20 reasonablebr br type phone case wanted meet need look nice hold card dont need pack separate wallet offer basic rfid protection card asking price reasonable iphone 13 want case hold couple credit card one consider,positive,2023,Phone Case

4.0,A very cool and durable feature phone - but for what market?,"I got a chance to try this handset after playing with their higher end M7, so I was sort of expecting a stripped down version of Android like that one has.<br />No such luck, this is a straight-up feature phone (aka ""dumb phone""), with no recognizable OS at all. A throwback to a simpler time, when we didn't have touch screens or apps, or even threaded text messaging! (seriously I forgot how difficult it is to carry a conversation when you can't see the previous messages leading up to it!)<br />It has a camera, but it's also reminiscent of the sort of quality you'd find on camera phones back in the pre-smartphone era. In other words, you can sort of tell what's going on in the photo but it's more of a novelty feature than a useful one. The UI is a little bit clunky and not entirely intuitive either, but you can navigate it well enough once you get used to it.<br />Where this phone shines is in its durability and function. This thing is built like a TANK, waterproof, drop proof, has a great rubber grip in your hands, and that speaker is LOUD. I mean, we're talking using it around factory floor welding machines loud. I love the LED circle on the back that lights up when you play audio, that's actually a really cool feature that normal phones don't have which looks fun and also serves the very real function of being able to find your phone when it rings!<br />The problem, however, is trying to determine who this product is for. They say seniors, but I'd argue it is not well suited for that market. The UI is not polished and feels clunky. My teenaged daughter, however, found the light up speaker really fun and actually wanted to try it out for a week, maybe experiment with decluttering her life from social media apps... but we all know that would be short lived.<br />Honestly, the best use I can think of for this device is someone who works in a rough job, like a factory floor or construction site. You don't want the delicate touch screen and two-handed operation that a common smartphone requires, but you want it loud and durable and life-proof. That's a good option, but then it sort of begs the question of why the ring light on the back? It sort of feels mixed up and unsure of what market to be a part of.<br />For what it is, if the features here speak to you and your needs in a phone, it seems a pretty good option so far!",2022-09-22 20:12:25,0,False,cool durable feature phone market,got chance try handset playing higher end m7 sort expecting stripped version android like one hasbr luck straightup feature phone aka dumb phone recognizable o throwback simpler time didnt touch screen apps even threaded text messaging seriously forgot difficult carry conversation cant see previous message leading itbr camera also reminiscent sort quality youd find camera phone back presmartphone era word sort tell whats going photo novelty feature useful one ui little bit clunky entirely intuitive either navigate well enough get used itbr phone shine durability function thing built like tank waterproof drop proof great rubber grip hand speaker loud mean talking using around factory floor welding machine loud love led circle back light play audio thats actually really cool feature normal phone dont look fun also serf real function able find phone ringsbr problem however trying determine product say senior id argue well suited market ui polished feel clunky teenaged daughter however found light speaker really fun actually wanted try week maybe experiment decluttering life social medium apps know would short livedbr honestly best use think device someone work rough job like factory floor construction site dont want delicate touch screen twohanded operation common smartphone requires want loud durable lifeproof thats good option sort begs question ring light back sort feel mixed unsure market part ofbr feature speak need phone seems pretty good option far,cool durable feature phone market got chance try handset playing higher end m7 sort expecting stripped version android like one hasbr luck straightup feature phone aka dumb phone recognizable o throwback simpler time didnt touch screen apps even threaded text messaging seriously forgot difficult carry conversation cant see previous message leading itbr camera also reminiscent sort quality youd find camera phone back presmartphone era word sort tell whats going photo novelty feature useful one ui little bit clunky entirely intuitive either navigate well enough get used itbr phone shine durability function thing built like tank waterproof drop proof great rubber grip hand speaker loud mean talking using around factory floor welding machine loud love led circle back light play audio thats actually really cool feature normal phone dont look fun also serf real function able find phone ringsbr problem however trying determine product say senior id argue well suited market ui polished feel clunky teenaged daughter however found light speaker really fun actually wanted try week maybe experiment decluttering life social medium apps know would short livedbr honestly best use think device someone work rough job like factory floor construction site dont want delicate touch screen twohanded operation common smartphone requires want loud durable lifeproof thats good option sort begs question ring light back sort feel mixed unsure market part ofbr feature speak need phone seems pretty good option far,positive,2022,Phone Holder

5.0,Even better than I had expected.,"I am so impressed with this pen. I bought a different pen before this one that claimed it worked with the 6th Gen IPad, but that was a joke. I found this one in a news story from Tech Watch and thought if it was good enough for Apple to use with their display models, that had to be positive. I am so happy that I bought this.<br /><br />The pen really does work with this model of IPad. The device even recognizes it as an Apple Pencil. The touch screen sensitivity is amazing and the palm rejection feature works beautifully, allowing you to rest your hand naturally on the screen to write and draw as you normally would on paper.<br /><br />The pen is very easy to set up, light and portable and not all that uncomfortable to use. I like the shape, as it ensures that it doesn’t roll off the desk or other surface when you set it down. The tip is durable and yet doesn’t scratch the front screen of the device, which, I must admit I was worried about with the previous pen I bought.<br /><br />The battery life is pretty good and will let you write or draw for a good number of hours before it needs recharging, which you can do with the lightning cable that comes with the IPad. The top of the pen is connected so you don’t lose it and it doesn’t require you to do anything special to begin using the pen right away. The writing is smooth and you can read your handwriting when you are done writing, a vast improvement over the last pen I tried. There is very little screen lag time and so it feels really natural to use this pen.<br /><br />Overall, for the price, I think this was a great investment. You can also get replacement tips directly from Logitech, 3 in a pack for a reasonable price for when the tip begins to wear down. I am super impressed with this pen. I’d definitely recommend it to other shoppers looking for something that is just as functional as the Apple Pencil, with half the price tag.",2019-07-07 15:13:42,6,True,even better expected,impressed pen bought different pen one claimed worked 6th gen ipad joke found one news story tech watch thought good enough apple use display model positive happy bought thisbr br pen really work model ipad device even recognizes apple pencil touch screen sensitivity amazing palm rejection feature work beautifully allowing rest hand naturally screen write draw normally would paperbr br pen easy set light portable uncomfortable use like shape ensures doesnt roll desk surface set tip durable yet doesnt scratch front screen device must admit worried previous pen boughtbr br battery life pretty good let write draw good number hour need recharging lightning cable come ipad top pen connected dont lose doesnt require anything special begin using pen right away writing smooth read handwriting done writing vast improvement last pen tried little screen lag time feel really natural use penbr br overall price think great investment also get replacement tip directly logitech 3 pack reasonable price tip begin wear super impressed pen id definitely recommend shopper looking something functional apple pencil half price tag,even better expected impressed pen bought different pen one claimed worked 6th gen ipad joke found one news story tech watch thought good enough apple use display model positive happy bought thisbr br pen really work model ipad device even recognizes apple pencil touch screen sensitivity amazing palm rejection feature work beautifully allowing rest hand naturally screen write draw normally would paperbr br pen easy set light portable uncomfortable use like shape ensures doesnt roll desk surface set tip durable yet doesnt scratch front screen device must admit worried previous pen boughtbr br battery life pretty good let write draw good number hour need recharging lightning cable come ipad top pen connected dont lose doesnt require anything special begin using pen right away writing smooth read handwriting done writing vast improvement last pen tried little screen lag time feel really natural use penbr br overall price think great investment also get replacement tip directly logitech 3 pack reasonable price tip begin wear super impressed pen id definitely recommend shopper looking something functional apple pencil half price tag,positive,2019,Screen Protector

4.0,Holds Phone Securely,"I come from a family of tech nerds. My husband got his first cardboard VR kit at a trade show a couple of years ago. In the last year we have gotten a few cardboard ones and a couple of plastic ones. This Bestrix one is very nice looking and very comfortable. It can accommodate my larger Samsung Galaxy J7 phone, although I do have to remove the case from it first. My phone will not fit in some of the cardboard versions. Phones are securely held in the headset. Some of the earlier ones that I have tried did not make me feel that my phone was 100% safe!  This works for simple VR apps. It does not have any kind of trigger mechanism so you can control your phone once it is in the headset. So if you're playing a game or visiting a VR world, you can not access the menu that shows up on your screen. I've used some VR world apps where that's not necessary, but there are a lot of them that do utilize a menu. It comes with some foam sticky buttons that you are supposed to put on the pull out try where your phone goes and line them up with the phone's buttons, but even with that, there's still no way to trigger the menu.

Unfortunately, the iPhone will no longer play through the radio nor will any of the radio controls work with the iPhone.  I guess I will have to look at getting a different type of docking radio.

4.0,Nice wireless charing stand,"You can't beat this 2 in one battery pack. Not only does it serve as your charger when at your desk or on your nightstand, but you can also take this battery pack with you when you travel. I always bring a battery pack with me when i travel because I read, watch some downloaded movies on my phone or play games to entertain myself, which obviously tends to drain your battery. Not all plains still have a way to help you charge your battery so having one on you will help. It is not the largest battery pack I have but you don't always need that. It has a couple of outlets which is awesome in case you do want to share with your fellow travelers.<br /><br />Some people complain about the bright light in the front. Personally that does not bother me. Actually when i travel I like that because I use it as a night light. it helps getting around in a different room like a hotel room or the cruise ship room that you are not aware of and prevents you from bumping into things. So instead of having to bring a night light you can use this, which personally I like. For those who don't like it, just cover it up, easy.<br /><br />All in all I really like this and can only recommend it. Is it worth $70, maybe not exactly, probably closer to like $50 in my eyes but that is what it sells for right now so hopefully with time the price will lower a little bit.",2019-12-11 12:34:39,0,False,nice wireless charing stand,cant beat 2 one battery pack serve charger desk nightstand also take battery pack travel always bring battery pack travel read watch downloaded movie phone play game entertain obviously tends drain battery plain still way help charge battery one help largest battery pack dont always need couple outlet awesome case want share fellow travelersbr br people complain bright light front personally bother actually travel like use night light help getting around different room like hotel room cruise ship room aware prevents bumping thing instead bring night light use personally like dont like cover easybr br really like recommend worth 70 maybe exactly probably closer like 50 eye sell right hopefully time price lower little bit,nice wireless charing stand cant beat 2 one battery pack serve charger desk nightstand also take battery pack travel always bring battery pack travel read watch downloaded movie phone play game entertain obviously tends drain battery plain still way help charge battery one help largest battery pack dont always need couple outlet awesome case want share fellow travelersbr br people complain bright light front personally bother actually travel like use night light help getting around different room like hotel room cruise ship room aware prevents bumping thing instead bring night light use personally like dont like cover easybr br really like recommend worth 70 maybe exactly probably closer like 50 eye sell right hopefully time price lower little bit,positive,2019,Phone Battery

4.0,Impressing budget phone,"[[VIDEOID:c2219b966be26a8f0df8951bdd80cd4e]] Blu has a reputation of being a decent budget brand and this handset continues that legacy. The first thing you notice is the display- surprisingly bright even in sunlight, and extremely vibrant for the price. Graphics and games are surprisngly fluid and sharp looking, it actually feels reminiscent of Motorola G series handsets. The performance is decent too:<br />Geekbench 5 single core: 342<br />Multi Core: 1200<br />Those test scores aren't current flagship level, but are better than, say, the Pixel 3a series and actually competitive to flagships from not too long ago. Pretty close to a Snapdragon 835 in performance, like a Galaxy S8, yet much more battery friendly.<br />The finger print reader is faster and more responsive than my Galaxy S10, but to be fair the S10 has the worst of the Galaxy fingerprint readers. It even comes with a case and screen protector so you are ready to go right out of the box! But the cameras... that's where the budget nature of this handset starts to show.<br />The camera, despite having a large looking array, really feel low budget. Low light is a non-starter, I won't even bother sharing the noisy garbage that comes out of it. But even in good light, colors are washed out and there's a severe lack of dynamic range that clips highlights and shadows pretty quickly. See photo comparison of a yellow and red box taken next to an open window in my office. The Galaxy S10 and Pixel3A properly captured light from outside the window as well as some detail in the black batteries under the box. It shouldn't be a surprise that those pictures look similar straight out of the camera app, the Pixel and Galaxy S series have some of the best ""standard by which others are judged"" camera performance in the industry. The Blu phone, however, overexposed the window, lost all detail in the battery, and the colors just overall look bad compared to them. I also took a picture trying the ""depth mode"" of a keychain on my wood colored desk, and the bokeh effect is a mess. It doesn't make any sense, blurring out random parts of the wood grain pattern and not looking like real bokeh AT ALL.<br /><br />Basically, this is a decent phone with decent performance and a very nice sized and vivid display for the money! But if cameras are any kind of priority to you, look elsewhere.",2022-04-25 22:47:42,1,False,impressing budget phone,videoidc2219b966be26a8f0df8951bdd80cd4e blu reputation decent budget brand handset continues legacy first thing notice display surprisingly bright even sunlight extremely vibrant price graphic game surprisngly fluid sharp looking actually feel reminiscent motorola g series handset performance decent toobr geekbench 5 single core 342br multi core 1200br test score arent current flagship level better say pixel 3a series actually competitive flagship long ago pretty close snapdragon 835 performance like galaxy s8 yet much battery friendlybr finger print reader faster responsive galaxy s10 fair s10 worst galaxy fingerprint reader even come case screen protector ready go right box camera thats budget nature handset start showbr camera despite large looking array really feel low budget low light nonstarter wont even bother sharing noisy garbage come even good light color washed there severe lack dynamic range clip highlight shadow pretty quickly see photo comparison yellow red box taken next open window office galaxy s10 pixel3a properly captured light outside window well detail black battery box shouldnt surprise picture look similar straight camera app pixel galaxy series best standard others judged camera performance industry blu phone however overexposed window lost detail battery color overall look bad compared also took picture trying depth mode keychain wood colored desk bokeh effect mess doesnt make sense blurring random part wood grain pattern looking like real bokeh allbr br basically decent phone decent performance nice sized vivid display money camera kind priority look elsewhere,impressing budget phone videoidc2219b966be26a8f0df8951bdd80cd4e blu reputation decent budget brand handset continues legacy first thing notice display surprisingly bright even sunlight extremely vibrant price graphic game surprisngly fluid sharp looking actually feel reminiscent motorola g series handset performance decent toobr geekbench 5 single core 342br multi core 1200br test score arent current flagship level better say pixel 3a series actually competitive flagship long ago pretty close snapdragon 835 performance like galaxy s8 yet much battery friendlybr finger print reader faster responsive galaxy s10 fair s10 worst galaxy fingerprint reader even come case screen protector ready go right box camera thats budget nature handset start showbr camera despite large looking array really feel low budget low light nonstarter wont even bother sharing noisy garbage come even good light color washed there severe lack dynamic range clip highlight shadow pretty quickly see photo comparison yellow red box taken next open window office galaxy s10 pixel3a properly captured light outside window well detail black battery box shouldnt surprise picture look similar straight camera app pixel galaxy series best standard others judged camera performance industry blu phone however overexposed window lost detail battery color overall look bad compared also took picture trying depth mode keychain wood colored desk bokeh effect mess doesnt make sense blurring random part wood grain pattern looking like real bokeh allbr br basically decent phone decent performance nice sized vivid display money camera kind priority look elsewhere,positive,2022,Screen Protector

I received mine as a review sample and just had to see if it would hold my Galaxy Note 3 - it would not. Of course I was just checking since this is not claimed to be compatible with such big phones.<br /><br />It worked beautifully with an HTC Droid Incredible, and I briefly enlisted a friend's help to check her iPhone 5S, which also works with it.<br /><br />The design is clever in that it uses a magnet that can either go between the back of your phone and a bumper-style case, or the second one that has an adhesive backing that attaches directly to phones and cases. The magnet holds the phone firmly in place, even when driving over bumpy terrain. It's easy to remove your phone by using an up, down or lateral sliding motion.<br /><br />The suction cup worked on my vehicle's textured dash, and the holder was able to accommodate a decent viewing angle for either driver or passenger (depending on where it's placed on the dash.)

4.0,Keeps your privacy and protects your screen!!,"This is a solid tempered glass screen Protector for iPhone 11- Only, this has an added bonus of being a privacy screen for those who want to keep information on their device safe guarded.<br />Basically, when looking straight on… The user can easily see their own information on screen. However, those around you or peering over your shoulder from an angle- don’t get that privilege..!! TBH, after a flight in close proximity with strangers- I realized the person next to me.. was 100% reading the content on my device.. Are you kidding me?!!  This eliminates those type of situations.. But, it’s not just for those without manners or, boundaries.. this is also a way to keep information safe and protect any passwords or private data you may type in or, have displayed on your screen... it really works! (which brings me to question… Why doesn’t apple build this type of safety into the original phone screen for all said reason..?! Hmm..)<br /><br />Applying this is straightforward and necessary items are included- only, my screen “cleaner wipe” was dried out- and I’ll admit.. aligning this with exact openings gave me an overall 98.9% perfect fit. Of course, it will do the job but.. if your OCD like myself- this may drive you crazy knowing that the exact notches are almost perfect but not quite.<br />so, for those two stated reasons..I deducted x1 star. Of course, One can utilize a different cleaner.. but, if the “kit” is all inclusive then it should be. And the fit- knowing it may be me being hyper critical.. and the fact, it seems to be performing its job well on both fronts- protecting my information and also, the screen on my device- I would definitely not call these deal breakers!<br />Sold as a pair at a decent price point.. I would definitely recommend and as a mom of 4 (and a husband who is a large child) I would not let a device be used without screen protection!!

Also, the screen touch doesn't work through the plastic so you have to remove the phone in order to change a setting.  I also dislike the armband itself.  The armband isn't elastic and when you sweat, the armband falls down your arm. The material also makes sweat causing irritation.  For the price, this is an okay armband.

If you're a clutz, get a different cover that offers more protection. The magnet closure doesn't provide a secure close.

5.0,Small and state-of-the-art,"Since my car is equipped with a factory hand's free bluetooth system I did not test this in the vehicle. Instead I am using this to wirelessly stream music to a home stereo system.<br /><br />When my review sample arrived I immediately replaced an aging Belkin F8Z492TTP Bluetooth Music Receiver that I had been using for the past three years with this receiver. The difference in the quality of my streamed music was immediately apparent. The sound quality now is like replacing my entire stereo instead of the bluetooth receiver.<br /><br />More importantly, the problems I had with signal quality and distance with the Belkin were eliminated. Despite the fact that bluetooth works best with the transmitting and receiving units are within line of sight I can walk into a room at the opposite end of my 2400 square foot house and still stream a clear, strong signal to the stereo.<br /><br />I tested the ability to connect two phones to this receiver for review purposes and it works as claimed. However, I doubt if I will use that feature since I am alone most of the time and this is set up in my house instead of my car. Still, it's a pretty advanced feature that I have not seen on any other received I have used or tested.<br /><br />Among the phones with which I have tested this are a Samsung Galaxy Note II and 3, an iPhone 4S and an iPad, and an iPhone 5S. It worked perfectly with all of those devices, and especially the iPhone 5S that did not play well with the Belkin that this received replaced.<br /><br />This ships as a complete kit. It includes a charging cable (albeit a relatively short one), a 3.5mm cable with male connectors on each end, and a 3.5mm female to dual 1/4 inch male RCA jack cable.

5.0,There's a lot to like here ...,"I originally purchased a Mophie Juice Pack Helium several months ago as my first foray into battery/charging cases for my iPhone 5s.  When I was offered this Vysk model, I decided to give it a try, to see which I preferred.<br /><br />Easy answer:  I'm switching to the Vysk EP1.  There's a lot to like about it:<br /><br /> -- ""non-slip"" grip<br />It has a textured back that makes it less likely to slip, and the edges are ""angled"" rather than curved like the Mophie.  The Mophie, although a nice case, was just too slippery compared to the Vysk.<br /><br /> -- It's MUCH easier to install than the Mophie.  I have a ""thin-film"" type screen protector on my iPhone and I didn't have any problem getting the case on the phone smoothly and easily.  I also like that the buttons on the phone actually protrude out of the Vysk case -- just far enough to be useful, but not so far that removing the case is impacted too much.  Because of the design, the earphone jack is recessed so there's a ""dongle"" supplied which allows you to use wired headphones (just like on the Mophie).<br /><br /> -- Recharging the phone from the case is relatively fast (&lt; 2 hrs from 5% to 100% on the phone).<br /><br /> -- I got one full (100%) charge from the case plus about a 50% second charge without recharging the case.<br />I had charged both phone and case to 100%.  Used the phone with the case switch ""off"" until phone got down to 5% charge.  Turned the case to + (on), and charged the phone.  As soon as the phone got to 100%, I turned the case off.  Ran the phone down to 5% again, turned the case on, and got to 58% before the Vysk ran out of power.  That's not too shabby, really.<br /><br />Basically, this unit exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />There are a few things that might be considered negatives:<br /><br /> -- As mentioned above, you have to us a separate ""dongle"" in order to use wired headphones.  That means you have to keep track of that little gizmo, and it might a somewhat inconvenient.  I use Bluetooth headphones and speakers, so it's not an issue for me, but it might be for you.<br /><br /> -- The added security is nice, but the lens cover also covers the camera's flash, which doubles as the flashlight.  With the cover in place, you cannot use the flashlight.  You have to remember to slide the cover over if you need to use the flashlight.  I consider this a minor inconvenience, but others may consider it more troublesome.<br /><br /> -- It does add to the weight of the phone. It is, after all, a battery, so it's going to add some weight.  Again, I don't mind this but others might.<br /><br />Overall, I'm sold on the Vysk EP1 unit.  I wasn't expecting it to be that much better than the Mophie, and they actually both perform well.  But the Vysk has some extras that I like better, so it has my vote.

I know where it is and it's within my reach, but the location of this is even more convenient. As a charger, I am very pleased. First of all, it has a blue light so you know that it's charging. I have had some car chargers that don't have any light, so if they wiggle out a bit to the point of not charging any more, I didn't know it. With this one, if the blue light is not on, then it's not charging. The speed of the charging is pretty good, too. It's definitely comparable to other car chargers regarding the speed. My husband and I did try the seat belt cutter on some cardboard and fabric scraps. It didn't cut in a smooth line, but it did saw through our materials eventually. The hammer feature was tested out on a block of wood. It left some dents in the wood. You would definitely have to be careful when working with glass because the size of it keeps your hand in a fairly close proximity to the surface you are trying to break.

2.0,Great Design But Too Small for Most Knitting Notions,"The PERFECT NOTION CASE has a great design, but it is too small!  The case has two storage compartments, each measuring 3-1/2"" wide by 2"" high by 1/2"" deep.  One compartment is undivided; the other compartment is divided into five smaller compartments.  Each individual storage area has a separate lid.  The product photo illustrates this quite clearly.<br /><br />The largest compartment isn't deep enough to hold a flat lip balm container or a spring-powered rollup tape measure, and it isn't long enough to hold a cable needle or a pair of embroidery scissors.  The only knitting notions I have that will fit in any of the compartments are point protectors, plain stitch markers, T-pins (for blocking), very small [[ASIN:B000QHD65S Boye stitch holders-1-3/4""]], and my beloved [[ASIN:B0019KAEEC Clover Lock Ring Markers]].<br /><br />The lids on the compartments snap firmly into place, and the outer case is firmly secured with a gate-type latch.  If this case were larger (perhaps 6"" x 4"" x 1""), it would be a wonderful case.  But as it is, the case is far too small to be of much practical use.  I purchased two of these cases sight unseen from my usual knitting goods supplier, and regret the purchase.

3.0,I love Batman and I wanted to try something other than ...,"I love Batman and I wanted to try something other than a pop socket. I tried these and liked that the ring moves 360° because you have a lot more control that way. I have an iPhone 8+ and it worked well. I’m giving this 3 stars because after 2-3 weeks, the ring became really loose and somewhat defeated the purpose. Another issue was that the bat symbol is actually really sharp around the edges in some spots because it’s made of metal. It’s not a big deal, just a little annoying. Finally, with the ring, your phone will never lay flat by any means because the connector for the ring is tiny and slightly taller than the rest of the gadget. With a pop socket, your phone has 1.5 inches of flat surface area to rest on so you don’t have this issue, so if your phone is on a table or something it’s really annoying to text or even switch songs because the phone will just wobble so much.

5.0,Definitely Charges Phones,"I use to use the portable Anker battery chargers to charge my phones. Now that wireless charging is popular, this device does a good job connecting, and staying connected, to wirelessly charge the phones. The magnet is strong. It charges the phone fast. And I love it’s a square little thing to carry around vs using a large portable charger.<br /><br />I used this mostly on my iPhone with Magsafe case until I finally decided to switch to the Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra (yea, never thought I would leave Apple world). When it charged my iPhone, it was fast and didn't get warm at all. On my Samsung Galaxy (not very many true Magsafe cases yet), I purchased a case here on Amazon that has the magnets built into the cases. Side note: being that the Galaxy S22 series is relatively new, I am hoping better, true MagSafe cases will surface. I pray manufacturers who make the same Apple cases will also make them for Android that has the wireless charging capability.  Anyways, I used this charger with a case that has the magnets built into it. After about 15-20 mins, the phone case is very warm. I didn’t like that, so I avoid using this device on my Galaxy (I kept my Apple phone due to Dexcom G6 and Insulin pump. Why I changed makers? Wanted something different.). I could try to charge without the case, and I probably should now that I think about it, and will at another time (will update later), but it is a pain in the butt to keep taking the phone out of the case.  I bought 2 different magnetic cases and stuck with the one I have now, I noticed that switching was causing my phone screen (Invishield Fusion) to start lifting around the edges. And we all know that brand is expensive!! I had to replace it - thank goodness for warranty!<br /><br />So in a nutshell, it works great with true MagSafe cases, but the cheap ones on the market right now do cause the phone to heat up. Fingers crossed that true MagSafe cases will be developed for non Apple phones!<br /><br />I do highly recommend this wireless battery charger.  It charges the phone fast, and also charges up just as fast too. You may be able to get a few phone charges out of it before having to give it some juice.<br /><br />Definitely a go for Apple MagSafe cases, but caution with other wireless charging cases. I hope this kinda helps. I will need to test this charger without a case at a later time. I know this doesn’t help at the moment, but I do love this charging gadget.",2022-09-06 19:10:07,3,True,definitely charge phone,use use portable anker battery charger charge phone wireless charging popular device good job connecting staying connected wirelessly charge phone magnet strong charge phone fast love square little thing carry around v using large portable chargerbr br used mostly iphone magsafe case finally decided switch samsung galaxy s22 ultra yea never thought would leave apple world charged iphone fast didnt get warm samsung galaxy many true magsafe case yet purchased case amazon magnet built case side note galaxy s22 series relatively new hoping better true magsafe case surface pray manufacturer make apple case also make android wireless charging capability anyways used charger case magnet built 1520 min phone case warm didnt like avoid using device galaxy kept apple phone due dexcom g6 insulin pump changed maker wanted something different could try charge without case probably think another time update later pain butt keep taking phone case bought 2 different magnetic case stuck one noticed switching causing phone screen invishield fusion start lifting around edge know brand expensive replace thank goodness warrantybr br nutshell work great true magsafe case cheap one market right cause phone heat finger crossed true magsafe case developed non apple phonesbr br highly recommend wireless battery charger charge phone fast also charge fast may able get phone charge give juicebr br definitely go apple magsafe case caution wireless charging case hope kinda help need test charger without case later time know doesnt help moment love charging gadget,definitely charge phone use use portable anker battery charger charge phone wireless charging popular device good job connecting staying connected wirelessly charge phone magnet strong charge phone fast love square little thing carry around v using large portable chargerbr br used mostly iphone magsafe case finally decided switch samsung galaxy s22 ultra yea never thought would leave apple world charged iphone fast didnt get warm samsung galaxy many true magsafe case yet purchased case amazon magnet built case side note galaxy s22 series relatively new hoping better true magsafe case surface pray manufacturer make apple case also make android wireless charging capability anyways used charger case magnet built 1520 min phone case warm didnt like avoid using device galaxy kept apple phone due dexcom g6 insulin pump changed maker wanted something different could try charge without case probably think another time update later pain butt keep taking phone case bought 2 different magnetic case stuck one noticed switching causing phone screen invishield fusion start lifting around edge know brand expensive replace thank goodness warrantybr br nutshell work great true magsafe case cheap one market right cause phone heat finger crossed true magsafe case developed non apple phonesbr br highly recommend wireless battery charger charge phone fast also charge fast may able get phone charge give juicebr br definitely go apple magsafe case caution wireless charging case hope kinda help need test charger without case later time know doesnt help moment love charging gadget,positive,2022,Phone Charger

5.0,Nice option for my Galaxy Watch 4,"I just got a new Galaxy Watch 4 and the band that came with it was a new design for me.  The end of the band tucked into the inside of the band rather than outside like a traditional watch band.<br />While that was nice, it was more difficult for me to get the watch off quickly so I started looking for other types of bands<br />This one caught my eye and it was also ""no gap"" which means the top of the strap which connects to the body of the watch was curved so that there was no gap between the band and the watch.  Now, I didn't know that was either a feature or a problem, all my other watches and bands had always had that gap, but this was an interesteing feature and this band had it, so I gave it a try.<br />I had also purchased some additional bands that were not No Gap  and I didn't like the color of the band that came with the watch. That means I had the original band and a few more to compare to this band.<br />The packaging is a bit odd with some questionable grammar choices, but overall I really liked the band.  It is made of a flexible material that fits well and I can adjust it to be more snug or loose as needed.<br />The only thing I had a slight problem with was the fact that the end of the band was outside the watch and could get caught.<br />That's right, the very reason I got this one was the one feature I had problems with.  I fixed the problem easily by sliding the little holding straps closer to the end of the band.  In this kind of flexible band the end does stick out and can get caught on things, but the benefits outweigh this little problem.<br />Overall, I'm very happy with the band, it makes it much easier to do the EKG, Stress anf O2 levels since it has a more snug fit.

3.0,WHY YOU SHOULDN'T BUY THIS PHONE,"I bought this phone SOLELY because it's the only newer phone that still has a micro-SD card slot for extra storage.  I had also had a Note 3 which lasted 17 years before we eventually retired it. (That'll NEVER happen with newer phones that are made to have to be replaced after a couple of years!). Now for a few of the reasons you should NOT get this phone:  1) THE BATTERY LIFE IS HORRENDOUS!  If you use your phone a lot, or use it for streaming or gaming, plan on having to charge it several times a day.  I actually use my phone very little compared to a lot of other people, I have it on extreme battery saver with most of my apps restricted from running in the background, and I STILL have to charge at least once a day, even though the settings tell me that I have 2.2 days of charge left.  2) AMAZON WILL NOT HONOR THEIR PREMIUM RENEWED COMMITMENT OF ONE YEAR REPLACEMENT OR REFUND--as stated clearly on the product description page!  In fact, they stated that they wouldn't even allow the 90 days that are given for lesser renewed products, only the same window for Christmas returns, which is less than 2 months!  3). It is nearly impossible to find a phone case with a built-in screen protector because of the unique CURVED screen on the phone, and the ones that are available don't work with the fingerprint reader.  Therefore, if you regularly drop your phone like I do, PLAN ON HAVING TO REPLACE YOUR PHONE ENTIRELY.

5.0,A Convenient Charging Solution,"These days everyone has at least one and probably multiple electronic devices that need regular charging. This tray allows you to establish an organized charging station so that you can recharge multiple devices at the same time. The tray has six USB ports and comes with six small cables. If you get the wrong cables, there is a notice on the instruction manual that you can write the manufacturer and they will send you free cables. You can also use the cables that you already own.<br /><br />The tray has plastic dividers that easily snap in place which you can add or remove at your convenience. They are wide enough to accommodate phones and tablets even if your devices have thin to moderate sized cases. If you have a very large case you can either remove the dividers, or lay your device down beside the station.<br /><br />This is a very practical tray, but I don't feel it is ideal for travel because you'd have to remove all the trays to ensure they don't break during transport. It is perfect for a home or office. The dividers light up blue when the device is plugged in and charging, and there's even an on/off switch at the back (although we just keep ours on). If you've ever gotten into an argument because somebody unplugged your device to charge their own, this is the product for you.

5.0,Rock solid and holds a Note 3 in its case,"First I want to address some complaints about the suction cup not holding - when you receive this mount there is a clear, thin backing on the suction cup that needs to be peeled off. While it's still affixed to the cup this mount will not adhere to anything including glass, After it has been removed it will stick to even the pebble grain dash in my vehicle. I have no clue why the backing is on the cup, but it MUST be removed before you can use this mount.<br /><br />Mine arrived as a review sample and The first thing I checked is whether or not it would hold my Galaxy Note 3. It does and even without having to remove it from the fat [[ASIN:B00GOHUNO6 Fliptroniks Chocolate Panther Leather Wallet Case]]. The flexible neck is truly heavy duty and I recommend adjusting it before affixing your mount to your dash or window. The reason is the neck is so thick and still that bending it after it's on the dash may actually break the suction. On the plus side this will hold your phone as steady as a rock.<br /><br />The mount itself is actually a clamp with inserts (the red strips in the photo) that protect against marring your phone when it's in the clamp's jaws. Like the neck, the action on the clamp is a little on the stiff side, but it will positively hold your phone in place.<br /><br />Bottom line: the only thing wrong with this mount is there is no warning about removing the suction cup's protective backing, which can be frustrating if you are not aware of it. But there is so much right, including the fact that it can firmly and steadily hold large and heavy phones and adjust to just about any viewing angle you need.",2014-11-25 04:16:21,92,False,rock solid hold note 3 case,first want address complaint suction cup holding receive mount clear thin backing suction cup need peeled still affixed cup mount adhere anything including glass removed stick even pebble grain dash vehicle clue backing cup must removed use mountbr br mine arrived review sample first thing checked whether would hold galaxy note 3 even without remove fat asinb00gohuno6 fliptroniks chocolate panther leather wallet case flexible neck truly heavy duty recommend adjusting affixing mount dash window reason neck thick still bending dash may actually break suction plus side hold phone steady rockbr br mount actually clamp insert red strip photo protect marring phone clamp jaw like neck action clamp little stiff side positively hold phone placebr br bottom line thing wrong mount warning removing suction cup protective backing frustrating aware much right including fact firmly steadily hold large heavy phone adjust viewing angle need,rock solid hold note 3 case first want address complaint suction cup holding receive mount clear thin backing suction cup need peeled still affixed cup mount adhere anything including glass removed stick even pebble grain dash vehicle clue backing cup must removed use mountbr br mine arrived review sample first thing checked whether would hold galaxy note 3 even without remove fat asinb00gohuno6 fliptroniks chocolate panther leather wallet case flexible neck truly heavy duty recommend adjusting affixing mount dash window reason neck thick still bending dash may actually break suction plus side hold phone steady rockbr br mount actually clamp insert red strip photo protect marring phone clamp jaw like neck action clamp little stiff side positively hold phone placebr br bottom line thing wrong mount warning removing suction cup protective backing frustrating aware much right including fact firmly steadily hold large heavy phone adjust viewing angle need,negative,2014,Phone Case

4.0,Charge Up to Four Items as Once,"We all know the importance of keeping our electronics charged and ready for use. Electronics are a fact of life and it is important that we keep enough charge to make sure they don’t run out of juice when we need them most. An easy way to keep electronics charged is through a wireless charging station, like this OCOMMO 4 in 1 Wireless Charging Pad.<br /><br />I have another wireless charging station, but mine is only good for one phone at a time and nothing more. With this charging station, you have space for two cell phones plus UBS ports where you can plug in and charge up to two more devices. This means the station can charge up to four items at once, which is great for those who have a lot of different electronics. Also, not every electronic is capable of wireless charging, but with the two USB, this isn’t a problem, since you can plug the other items in, as needed.<br /><br />My kids have more than just cell phones, so I know that they can use a device like this. My older daughter loves this- she can charge her phone wirelessly, next to her bed, and easily reach for it and remove it from the stand as needed, without having to mess with a cord. The wireless action charges just as quickly as using a cord- she told me there is no difference. Again, the advantage with this charging station is that you can charge four items at the same time. And since it is flat in design, it is easy to take anywhere with you.<br /><br />Electronics need constant charging and this OCOMMO 4 in 1 Charging Pad is an efficient way to keep your electronics juiced up and ready to go.

4.0,Keeps Your Phone Securely in Place,"With as much time as I spend driving and as much as I use my cell phone’s navigation system, it is imperative that I have some way to keep my cell phone safely visible. A cell phone holder is the obvious solution to the concern and a very good choice is the Baseus Car Vent Cell Phone Holder.<br /><br />My first experience with a cell phone holder was one of the types that attaches itself to the dash. These phone holders rely on suction cups and/or adhesive to stay in place and my experience with them has been negative overall mainly because they tend to loosen up and fall over, often with minimal touching or pressure. I knew that a car vent style holder was better and that is what convinced me to get this device from Baseus.<br /><br />This cell phone holder clips to your car vent and it comes with two different clipping attachments. One of them has legs, the other does not. I found that the one with legs takes more effort to attach and it appears that this is due to the fact that the round ball is a little larger with the one with legs, making it more difficult to screw the nut into place. The other attachment, without the legs, attaches more securely.<br /><br />With its flat backing, this cell phone holder helps protect against excessive hot or cold air coming from your car vent and affecting your cell phone. This was a concern of mine, because I know that when my cell phone overheats, it loses power quickly. The backing on this holder provides a barrier and keeps your phone from getting hit directly by the air coming from the vent.<br /><br />This holder remains secure while I drive and it hasn’t popped loose even once. I like that there is sufficient room to plug in my cord without any interference and I like that I can reach for my phone, touch the screen, and press buttons without worry. To remove your phone from the holder, all you have to do is press the release button. Functionally, it works well and you can even turn your phone sideways if you like without any problem, thanks to the design.<br /><br />Car vent mounted cell phone holders are the way to go and this model from Baseus is a very good one for those of us who use our phone frequently for navigation. I did have the one issue with the attachment with legs not fitting very well, but the other attachment works just fine and it keeps my phone securely in place while I drive. It’s a good cell phone holder for the money and I continue to use it each day.",2019-04-08 03:57:28,0,False,keep phone securely place,much time spend driving much use cell phone navigation system imperative way keep cell phone safely visible cell phone holder obvious solution concern good choice baseus car vent cell phone holderbr br first experience cell phone holder one type attache dash phone holder rely suction cup andor adhesive stay place experience negative overall mainly tend loosen fall often minimal touching pressure knew car vent style holder better convinced get device baseusbr br cell phone holder clip car vent come two different clipping attachment one leg found one leg take effort attach appears due fact round ball little larger one leg making difficult screw nut place attachment without leg attache securelybr br flat backing cell phone holder help protect excessive hot cold air coming car vent affecting cell phone concern mine know cell phone overheats loses power quickly backing holder provides barrier keep phone getting hit directly air coming ventbr br holder remains secure drive hasnt popped loose even like sufficient room plug cord without interference like reach phone touch screen press button without worry remove phone holder press release button functionally work well even turn phone sideways like without problem thanks designbr br car vent mounted cell phone holder way go model baseus good one u use phone frequently navigation one issue attachment leg fitting well attachment work fine keep phone securely place drive good cell phone holder money continue use day,keep phone securely place much time spend driving much use cell phone navigation system imperative way keep cell phone safely visible cell phone holder obvious solution concern good choice baseus car vent cell phone holderbr br first experience cell phone holder one type attache dash phone holder rely suction cup andor adhesive stay place experience negative overall mainly tend loosen fall often minimal touching pressure knew car vent style holder better convinced get device baseusbr br cell phone holder clip car vent come two different clipping attachment one leg found one leg take effort attach appears due fact round ball little larger one leg making difficult screw nut place attachment without leg attache securelybr br flat backing cell phone holder help protect excessive hot cold air coming car vent affecting cell phone concern mine know cell phone overheats loses power quickly backing holder provides barrier keep phone getting hit directly air coming ventbr br holder remains secure drive hasnt popped loose even like sufficient room plug cord without interference like reach phone touch screen press button without worry remove phone holder press release button functionally work well even turn phone sideways like without problem thanks designbr br car vent mounted cell phone holder way go model baseus good one u use phone frequently navigation one issue attachment leg fitting well attachment work fine keep phone securely place drive good cell phone holder money continue use day,positive,2019,Phone Holder

4.0,"I admit, I like it","I am still not ready to pay 50 bucks or more a month for an iPhone and this was the next best thing.<br /><br />PROS<br />In a case, it is pretty indestructible. I have dropped mine and had the back pop off and it come apart and yet, I snap it back together and it works like a charm.<br /><br />You can personalize it much better than the older phones<br /><br />I love the blue icon grid (used to just have green and orange and now has green and blue and the blue is AWESOME)<br /><br />Holds quite a few pictures, videos and songs<br /><br />You can customize the front grid so whatever you want is on there<br /><br />I actually like the Qwerty keyboard. I am a big fan of those and they work very well for me. I know some people hate them but I am not one of them<br /><br />Holds a charge for quite a long time<br /><br />Sets multiple alarms (my last phone didn't do that but it was pretty old)<br /><br />Great music sound<br /><br />The loud ring is really loud and the vibrate is pretty strong so you do feel it<br /><br />The notepad feature is pretty good. I use it a lot for my grocery list<br /><br />I love the fact that you can set world times so that all you have to do is click the icon and it will take you to the time of the city you are looking for. I have friends or relatives in several cities around the world and I find myself using this more than I thought I would.<br /><br />CONS<br />It is not as ""cool"" as the iPhone<br /><br />It is easy to punch a button by accident (like your voicemail)and that is super annoying<br /><br />The videos have to be put into another format to play on the Brightside and its a little annoying to put them on<br /><br />The bluetooth settings are not very good and its very hard to get it to be compatible<br /><br />It needs more fonts and needs a larger font for people who have difficulty seeing. The large font is not very large and the normal font is tiny<br /><br />You cannot set the phone so that it locks after a few minutes. This was a great safety feature on other phones and this phone does not have it and I don't know why. If it is stolen, it can be used by the thief. The security features on the iPhone are much better than this phone and the older flip phones were much better than this phone.<br /><br />The camera is awful. The pictures are dark and grainy. I have used it but it really is awful.<br /><br />It only has two languages, English and Spanish. If you wanted Russian, Hebrew, Yiddish, Chinese etc....don't go with this phone, go with another phone.<br /><br />Very hard to use it with voice prompts but it says it has those. It may be that bluetooth is very hard to set up and that is why.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />All in all. I am happy with it but in a few years when only smartphones are offered, I will have to bite the bullet and I will get an iPhone and get one and I know it will be better than this one but for now, this one is ok and as I share a service plan...I only pay $15 a month and rarely go over my minutes.",2013-03-23 23:17:04,4,False,admit like,still ready pay 50 buck month iphone next best thingbr br prosbr case pretty indestructible dropped mine back pop come apart yet snap back together work like charmbr br personalize much better older phonesbr br love blue icon grid used green orange green blue blue awesomebr br hold quite picture video songsbr br customize front grid whatever want therebr br actually like qwerty keyboard big fan work well know people hate one thembr br hold charge quite long timebr br set multiple alarm last phone didnt pretty oldbr br great music soundbr br loud ring really loud vibrate pretty strong feel itbr br notepad feature pretty good use lot grocery listbr br love fact set world time click icon take time city looking friend relative several city around world find using thought wouldbr br consbr cool iphonebr br easy punch button accident like voicemailand super annoyingbr br video put another format play brightside little annoying put onbr br bluetooth setting good hard get compatiblebr br need font need larger font people difficulty seeing large font large normal font tinybr br set phone lock minute great safety feature phone phone dont know stolen used thief security feature iphone much better phone older flip phone much better phonebr br camera awful picture dark grainy used really awfulbr br two language english spanish wanted russian hebrew yiddish chinese etcdont go phone go another phonebr br hard use voice prompt say may bluetooth hard set whybr br conclusionbr happy year smartphones offered bite bullet get iphone get one know better one one ok share service plani pay 15 month rarely go minute,admit like still ready pay 50 buck month iphone next best thingbr br prosbr case pretty indestructible dropped mine back pop come apart yet snap back together work like charmbr br personalize much better older phonesbr br love blue icon grid used green orange green blue blue awesomebr br hold quite picture video songsbr br customize front grid whatever want therebr br actually like qwerty keyboard big fan work well know people hate one thembr br hold charge quite long timebr br set multiple alarm last phone didnt pretty oldbr br great music soundbr br loud ring really loud vibrate pretty strong feel itbr br notepad feature pretty good use lot grocery listbr br love fact set world time click icon take time city looking friend relative several city around world find using thought wouldbr br consbr cool iphonebr br easy punch button accident like voicemailand super annoyingbr br video put another format play brightside little annoying put onbr br bluetooth setting good hard get compatiblebr br need font need larger font people difficulty seeing large font large normal font tinybr br set phone lock minute great safety feature phone phone dont know stolen used thief security feature iphone much better phone older flip phone much better phonebr br camera awful picture dark grainy used really awfulbr br two language english spanish wanted russian hebrew yiddish chinese etcdont go phone go another phonebr br hard use voice prompt say may bluetooth hard set whybr br conclusionbr happy year smartphones offered bite bullet get iphone get one know better one one ok share service plani pay 15 month rarely go minute,positive,2013,Phone Case
5.0,Solid phone stand helps me stay connected to my world,"I work from home and I don’t want a lot of things cluttering up my desk. This phone stand is the best purchase I could have made to keep my phone upright and easy for me to view or access, while not taking up a lot of room. This is so much better than having my phone lay flat on the desk.<br /><br />This stand is sturdy and can be adjusted to most any angle you want. Again, so much easier for me to view the screen than having the phone lay flat.<br /><br />I especially like the rubber-lined base to keep the whole stand from moving around. Also the little feet you rest the phone on are rubberized…and the back inside surface. Not only does this keep my phone secure, but it is not noisy when I put it back on the stand each time. I often just reach over to tap the phone and it never moves, or I pick it up for more detailed use.<br /><br />AND… I can even put my tablet on this stand, if I want.<br /><br />I don’t personally use this feature, but there is an opening for a charging cable if needed.<br /><br />This stand will hold up well, is stylish in appearance, and I see no need for me to look for anything else…and I think it’s a great value.<br /><br />I have sent this out as Christmas gifts and sent one to my son’s house for me to use when I’m visiting.

4.0,Fits my Moto g7 Supra perfectly,"My 5 year old Samsung Note 4 recently died, and the only affordable replacement I could find is a Motorola Moto g7 Supra (Cricket).  I had been using a wonderful Caseology protective case on my Note 4, but didn't find one for the new Moto, so I chose this Spigen case.  It fits about the same, leaves plenty of access room for cameras and fingerprint authentication, etc.  I also like the fact that there's a small lip on the Spigen so that, if I put the Moto down screen down, the case keeps the screen from touching the surface I placed it upon.  The only thing I kind of dislike about it is that, rather than the slightly softer, grippy feel of my old case, this Spigen feels a bit more like XXX fine sandpaper.  Which is okay, except that, since the Moto is slightly heavier than my old Samsung, the grip feels a little less secure, and I have a feeling the Spigen will attract a lot more fine dust to its surface.

I'm a nut for Alexa and having her in my truck is something I have looked forward to for a long time. Unfortunately, the Roav just isn't ready for the way I use Alexa.<br /><br />I talk to her and use her for adding things to my calendar, remembering specific information, operating my lights, playing music and primarily my audiobooks.

Half the time I just give up and play it directly through my SYNC Bluetooth system in my truck. The ROAV is no better with music going down the road.<br /><br />My other issue is for the ridiculous lag time. It typically takes ten seconds for Alexa to respond to any questions and often takes significantly longer. Today I actually timed it. I asked her what time it was at 9:57am. At 9:59m, she finally told me it was 9:57am.<br />If you have a solid bars of cellular service it's fine. However, the minute you drop to three bars or less, Alexa looses her ability to function and the entire thing stops. If you're only driving around a big city, you may never see any problems.

5.0,Works Well with My External Hard Drives,"I have a couple of USB 3.0 external hard drives that I use for storing pictures and software archives, and both of them use this exact cable type to connect to the computer. I was interested in the NewLobo cable as a spare cable as I am always misplacing the ones I use with the drives and having a backup cable would be very handy. So far this cable has worked out very well for me and has given me no issues at all.<br /><br />First things first - NewLobo offers a 1-year warranty on their cable and that says a lot. It’s not a particularly expensive cable and it would cost more to replace the cable under warranty than the cable is actually worth. This says that NewLobo believes in their product and that’s a big deal to me. I have used so many products that have a nameless, faceless manufacturer and when it breaks there’s no recourse. Even if it is just a simple cable, I find it reassuring that the manufacturer stands behind it.<br /><br />This is the flat-style cable, not round, and there are some advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, it is less likely to tangle. That said, I am usually not a fan of flat cables as I can’t help but think that a flat cable is weaker at the ends where it connects to the plugs. This is based on speculation only and has no basis on experience.<br /><br />Operationally, it is a perfect drop-in replacement for the cables that come with my drives. I did not notice a speed difference between this cable and the others I use and I had no trouble mounting/unmounting/accessing my drives through this cable. I am satisfied with it.<br /><br />The fact that these come in a 2-pack is gravy.<br /><br />I am satisfied with this cable and am happy to recommend it. It’s a no-nonsense cable that gets the job done, and it is not expensive at all - especially in a 2-pack.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

But remember that on certain VR videos on YT, at least the good ones that are 360 immersive, you need to click the GOGGLE icon in the Youtube video itself. Because when you start playing a Youtube VR video, it assumes you do not have a google, and so the default is non-VR. You need to change it to VR by hitting goggle icon. Around this price point, some goggles come with a button so you can make selections within they YT app without having to remove your phone, but this goggle doesn't have such button.

5.0,Well made and perfect for cutting invasive bamboo stands,"I received these as a free review sample. Instead of beating around the bush I'll get to the reason why I gave it five stars: it will cut through bamboo, and not just shoots, but six-to-eight footers that are nearly an inch in diameter. That alone makes me love this because large areas of my property has become home to invasive bamboo that a neighbor planted and has taken over my yard as well as others in the neighborhood.<br /><br />These shears will cut through new bamboo up to eight feet tall with little effort. The operative word is 'new' because dead stands that are brown require a saw. These will also cut through brush and shrubs as fast and much easier than the other shears and trimmers I own, including long handle pruning shears.<br /><br />A final reason why I rated these so highly is the construction is first rate. I did notice a slight wobble where the pinned handles met, but the blade still seated perfectly into the channel in the opposite handle, and after using these for a full day the shears were still rock solid.  The handles are also nicely designed and easy to grip and operate for long periods - especially when cutting bamboo.<br /><br />Overall, these are well made and do a better job than other shears that I own or have used. Are they the best? Perhaps, but I cannot say for sure. I will say that they are perfect for my needs, and if I were to lose then I would not hesitate to replace them.",2016-04-21 05:27:15,0,False,well made perfect cutting invasive bamboo stand,received free review sample instead beating around bush ill get reason gave five star cut bamboo shoot sixtoeight footer nearly inch diameter alone make love large area property become home invasive bamboo neighbor planted taken yard well others neighborhoodbr br shear cut new bamboo eight foot tall little effort operative word new dead stand brown require saw also cut brush shrub fast much easier shear trimmer including long handle pruning shearsbr br final reason rated highly construction first rate notice slight wobble pinned handle met blade still seated perfectly channel opposite handle using full day shear still rock solid handle also nicely designed easy grip operate long period especially cutting bamboobr br overall well made better job shear used best perhaps say sure say perfect need lose would hesitate replace,well made perfect cutting invasive bamboo stand received free review sample instead beating around bush ill get reason gave five star cut bamboo shoot sixtoeight footer nearly inch diameter alone make love large area property become home invasive bamboo neighbor planted taken yard well others neighborhoodbr br shear cut new bamboo eight foot tall little effort operative word new dead stand brown require saw also cut brush shrub fast much easier shear trimmer including long handle pruning shearsbr br final reason rated highly construction first rate notice slight wobble pinned handle met blade still seated perfectly channel opposite handle using full day shear still rock solid handle also nicely designed easy grip operate long period especially cutting bamboobr br overall well made better job shear used best perhaps say sure say perfect need lose would hesitate replace,positive,2016,Screen Protector

I did not recharge the power bank. 4 months later, it was still sitting there in my room. Then the power went out after a tree fell on a line - and it stayed out. My phone was about to die. But I need my internet! I whipped out the power bank, thinking it would be dead by now, or at least very little charge from having charged my phone twice while camping. Nope! It charged it full again and still indicated it had some power left in it.<br />The case is mostly plastic, but seems solid enough. You shouldn't be stomping on your power bank, anyway. Frankly, for the price, I'm pretty pleased. It has held up well. I actually DID step on my messenger bag one - which the bank was in - stepped right on the bank in the bag.

Plus the plug folds back so that you can just toss it in a backpack or purse.<br /><br />Please note that the charging cord connections in this plug are USB C, NOT standard USB.

Every time I have attempted to use it people I have called can not hear me and I spend the entire conversation screaming and repeating myself.

It also worries me that the magnets in the case closure are kinda close to my cards, which could mess up the magnetic strip.

5.0,This is the best case for the Samsung Galaxy Note 2 (I prefer it even over the OtterBox Commuter),"After reading many reviews on the OtterBox cases, I initially ordered an OtterBox Commuter because a lot people were complaining about the Defender's added bulk and the screen protector getting dusty.<br /><br />The OtterBox Commuter is an excellent case, no question about it. But for me, there was one problem: the Galaxy Note 2 in an OtterBox Commuter is still too big to fit comfortably in your pocket. In fact, you're going to eventually wear a hole in most pants if you keep your Galaxy Note 2 Commuter in your pocket all day (the corners of the case rub and stretch the fabric when you're sitting down, and digging the phone in and out of your pocket all day puts stress on the pocket seams as well).<br /><br />So I ordered an OtterBox Defender to try out. Having used both, I prefer the OtterBox Defender over the Commuter. The Defender's outer shell has a nicer grip that feels better and more secure in your hand. The built-in screen protector has not been an issue (I was worried about it after reading some other people's reviews, but so far I have no complaints about dust or its usability). And the Defender's belt clip allows you to wear the phone on your belt instead of in your pocket. Granted, phone belt clips are not ideal but it's better than ruining your expensive dress work pants. Also, the Defender belt clip is very high quality and it positions the phone flat against your side so it's not that bad looking.<br /><br />In terms of added bulk, the Defender is really not much larger than the Commuter (certainly less of a difference than I was expecting).<br /><br />Finally, the Defender does offer more rugged protection than the Commuter - although the Commuter is probably more than adequate protection for most normal situations.<br /><br />Overall, I really like the OtterBox Defender case and am very happy with it.",2013-02-08 01:10:28,1,True,best case samsung galaxy note 2 prefer even otterbox commuter,reading many review otterbox case initially ordered otterbox commuter lot people complaining defender added bulk screen protector getting dustybr br otterbox commuter excellent case question one problem galaxy note 2 otterbox commuter still big fit comfortably pocket fact youre going eventually wear hole pant keep galaxy note 2 commuter pocket day corner case rub stretch fabric youre sitting digging phone pocket day put stress pocket seam wellbr br ordered otterbox defender try used prefer otterbox defender commuter defender outer shell nicer grip feel better secure hand builtin screen protector issue worried reading people review far complaint dust usability defender belt clip allows wear phone belt instead pocket granted phone belt clip ideal better ruining expensive dress work pant also defender belt clip high quality position phone flat side bad lookingbr br term added bulk defender really much larger commuter certainly less difference expectingbr br finally defender offer rugged protection commuter although commuter probably adequate protection normal situationsbr br overall really like otterbox defender case happy,best case samsung galaxy note 2 prefer even otterbox commuter reading many review otterbox case initially ordered otterbox commuter lot people complaining defender added bulk screen protector getting dustybr br otterbox commuter excellent case question one problem galaxy note 2 otterbox commuter still big fit comfortably pocket fact youre going eventually wear hole pant keep galaxy note 2 commuter pocket day corner case rub stretch fabric youre sitting digging phone pocket day put stress pocket seam wellbr br ordered otterbox defender try used prefer otterbox defender commuter defender outer shell nicer grip feel better secure hand builtin screen protector issue worried reading people review far complaint dust usability defender belt clip allows wear phone belt instead pocket granted phone belt clip ideal better ruining expensive dress work pant also defender belt clip high quality position phone flat side bad lookingbr br term added bulk defender really much larger commuter certainly less difference expectingbr br finally defender offer rugged protection commuter although commuter probably adequate protection normal situationsbr br overall really like otterbox defender case happy,positive,2013,Screen Protector

1.0,"Cute but disposable. I really wanted to like this product, but..","Pros:<br /> Easy to use. I like that I didn't have to unscrew anything to make the band go on. Just pop your Blaze out, and pop this in through the back. Feels secure, I've never worried about my Blaze slipping out. Band buckle is secure too.<br /><br />However.. CONS:<br />Color wears off. Ive had two designs from this company. I don't switch them out every day, but instead wear them day in and day out for several weeks. One had a black background with silver. The silver wore away in spots, leaving me with noticeable black areas. Looks shabby now. I gave it a pass and bought another design, the one I am reviewing now. This design that I am reviewing in particular is a white base with the additional colors on top (pink, green, black). So when those colors began to wear away, the white showed through. Again, making it look shabby.<br /><br />Additionally, and the WORST part of it, is that it didn't take much for the band to rip. Now this made me angry. That could have been the loss of an expensive piece of technology.  It tore right across the band. That was it for me.<br /><br />Too bad the cons outweighed the pros. I really wanted to like this product. I love all the cute designs and overall ease of swapping out.

I own a Mercedes, VW GTI never used it in these cars only in my American made car. This will solve a lot of problems for you people with foreign cars it is not the plugin it is the European car.

3.0,Good Phone With a Few Negative Behaviors,"I have been a Verizon customer for several years and I had a first generation Droid for many of those years. I have used phones from Samsung, Motorola, LG and Nokia but up until this point I have never used a Kyocera phone. I was interested in trying the Hydro Elite, and so far my experience has been middle-of-the-road - there are some areas for improvement.<br /><br />First things first - I received the phone through the Vine program and it did NOT come with the SIM card. This is probably because it was not a purchased phone but is an evaluation handset. The phone does not come with service right out of the box, it has to be activated and a SIM card is needed for that. People buying a service plan should get a card. People (like me) who are already on Verizon and already have a smart phone will have a card in their old phones which can be used in this new phone. The SIM card itself does not make the card work, it needs the data written on it. Verizon customers (new and existing) will get what they need to activate this phone, so if you buy this phone and subscribe to a plan you'll have a card in it when it arrives.<br /><br />I took the SIM card out of my current phone, popped it into the Hydro Elite and powered it on. It immediately connected to the network, acquired my phone number and activated itself. Within just a couple of minutes, it was ready to go.<br /><br />The Hydro Elite is a petite Android phone, smaller than most other smart phones I have seen. Very curvy and smooth, it is similar in looks to an iPhone, but it's actually an Android-based offering. It's a tight and solid little device, built to handle a little moisture and some jostling.<br /><br />I particularly like the brightness and clarity of the screen. In spite of being slightly smaller than other smart phones I have used, the screen is very clear and crisp.<br /><br />One of the main complaints I have seen regarding this phone is about call quality. I think the call clarity is acceptable although I have used clearer and better-sounding hand sets in the past. It has the very slight sound of talking in a tunnel or in a can, though I have to look for this in order to really mind it much. The volume is fine too and can be adjusted. That all said, the sound quality when the speaker phone is used is mediocre at best.<br /><br />My first issue occurred when I tried to connect to my wireless network. It located it, allowed me to put in my security key, and then constantly insisted the network was out of range - even when I was three feet from the router. I deleted the connection, put it in again and the problem is gone. I suspect I entered the key in incorrectly, but I never received a message as such.<br /><br />The next issue I ran into involves the Verizon stuff installed on it. Once I connected to the wireless network I get a very persistent message that appears about Verizon's location service sending a large number of SMS messages. I have not yet figured out the silver bullet to make this stop and it interferes with everything I try to do on this phone. I am sure there is some way to make this quit happening but I have not found it yet. I don't care if the application sends SMS data or not - I just don't want to hear about it every 10-15 seconds (yes, it's that persistent). This is not Kyocera's fault - this is Verizon's issue, and for me this is absolutely unacceptable.<br /><br />I use my phone in my car every day and my car is set up to allow Bluetooth phones to connect to it for voice commands and hands-free operation. Connecting the Hydro Elite was very simple and I had no difficulty connecting the two. However, one thing that did not happen was that the phone book never downloaded and I could not call anyone by voice command. This is an inconvenience and is probably not entirely Kyocera's fault, but I have not figured out how to get the car's system to see the phone book which was automatic with other phones I have used. I can still use the dashboard buttons to dial, but that's not ideal.<br /><br />This is not that bad of a phone. It's actually a nice little phone and it works pretty well. I love the screen and it's an attractive little device. However, it has some issues with implementation that make it a little harder to recommend.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/30/13: Following the suggestion of a fellow reviewer, I allowed the phone to connect to the Play store and updated the VZ Security application and this solved the issue with the persistent message about SMS data. It is unfortunate that Verizon's application made it out the door in this state but I am glad it has been fixed. From the message that would appear, it was not at all clear that the security application was behind the issue. I am leaving the rating at 3 stars for now.",2013-10-23 03:07:46,0,False,good phone negative behavior,verizon customer several year first generation droid many year used phone samsung motorola lg

5.0,"Fast responses, incredible battery, water and dust resistant. Screen protector built in","After 18 months of hard use, my husband's Sony Xperia phone needs to be retired. He travels overseas into some harsh environments for work and all over the US. His phone is constantly getting banged around, tossed in luggage, exposed to high heat, cold, damp and blowing sand. We've tried every case on the market and the only thing that is reliable are the heavy duty Otterboxes, but they add bulk and reduce the touch screen capacity - especially with gloves in winter. When I saw this CAT phone, I knew he needed to give it a try.<br /><br />It's fully ruggedized and water proof. The specs indicate that it can take a drop, extreme temperatures, sand and water exposure. The phone is essentially built into its own Otterboxes style case, including a permanent screen protector. No more bubbles! All of the ports - charging, ear phone and sim card & memory card slots are sealable. This adds bulk to the phone, of course, but it's not a big deal. A reasonable trade-off for protection you don't have to fiddle with.<br /><br />The screen is clear and very responsive, even with thin gloves on. The colors on videos are sharp and true. (See photos - the horse and rider are Edward Gal on Glock Voice in Europe) Calls are clear for both sides, though the volume could be a bit higher for windy conditions. This phone is certified for use with multiple hearing aids if needed. Surfing the internet via both WiFi and our AT&T cellular connection is snappy and stutter free because there's relatively little bloat ware preinstalled since this is an unlocked phone. We have a couple of games on it - Bejeweled, Angry Birds and Solitaire and all work smoothly with no stumbling. Watching YouTube videos is also fast and trouble free. The enormous battery boggles the mind when compared to the old Sony phone - watching twenty minutes of videos, playing Bejeweled (notorious battery hog) for ten minutes and sending texts only reduced the battery from 98% to 90%.<br /><br />My only complaint is the camera quality. It takes decent photos, but the old Xperia phone had an amazing camera, so decent is a bit of a let down. The pictures are fine for just quick snaps of the dogs being cute or a selfie, but if you want to take beautiful family pics, this camera probably isn't the best choice.  All the other features far outweigh this small issue for us though. The battery size and ruggedized construction alone are enough to make my husband very happy with the CAT phone.",2017-12-12 20:35:23,10,False,fast response incredible battery water dust resistant screen protector built,18 month hard use husband sony xperia phone need retired travel overseas harsh environment work u phone constantly getting banged around tossed luggage exposed high heat cold damp blowing sand weve tried every case market thing reliable heavy duty otterboxes add bulk reduce touch screen capacity especially glove winter saw cat phone knew needed give trybr br fully ruggedized water proof spec indicate take drop extreme temperature sand water exposure phone essentially built otterboxes style case including permanent screen protector bubble port charging ear phone sim card memory card slot sealable add bulk phone course big deal reasonable tradeoff protection dont fiddle withbr br screen clear responsive even thin glove color video sharp true see photo horse rider edward gal glock voice europe call clear side though volume could bit higher windy condition phone certified use multiple hearing aid needed surfing internet via wifi att cellular connection snappy stutter free there relatively little bloat ware preinstalled since unlocked phone couple game bejeweled angry bird solitaire work smoothly stumbling watching youtube video also fast trouble free enormous battery boggles mind compared old sony phone watching twenty minute video playing bejeweled notorious battery hog ten minute sending text reduced battery 98 90br br complaint camera quality take decent photo old xperia phone amazing camera decent bit let picture fine quick snap dog cute selfie want take beautiful family pic camera probably isnt best choice feature far outweigh small issue u though battery size ruggedized construction alone enough make husband happy cat phone,fast response incredible battery water dust resistant screen protector built 18 month hard use husband sony xperia phone need retired travel overseas harsh environment work u phone constantly getting banged around tossed luggage exposed high heat cold damp blowing sand weve tried every case market thing reliable heavy duty otterboxes add bulk reduce touch screen capacity especially glove winter saw cat phone knew needed give trybr br fully ruggedized water proof spec indicate take drop extreme temperature sand water exposure phone essentially built otterboxes style case including permanent screen protector bubble port charging ear phone sim card memory card slot sealable add bulk phone course big deal reasonable tradeoff protection dont fiddle withbr br screen clear responsive even thin glove color video sharp true see photo horse rider edward gal glock voice europe call clear side though volume could bit higher windy condition phone certified use multiple hearing aid needed surfing internet via wifi att cellular connection snappy stutter free there relatively little bloat ware preinstalled since unlocked phone couple game bejeweled angry bird solitaire work smoothly stumbling watching youtube video also fast trouble free enormous battery boggles mind compared old sony phone watching twenty minute video playing bejeweled notorious battery hog ten minute sending text reduced battery 98 90br br complaint camera quality take decent photo old xperia phone amazing camera decent bit let picture fine quick snap dog cute selfie want take beautiful family pic camera probably isnt best choice feature far outweigh small issue u though battery size ruggedized construction alone enough make husband happy cat phone,positive,2017,Screen Protector

5.0,"Perfect for not only the LG headsets, but the more generic HV-series too","I received this as a free review sample. It is ostensibly designed for the LG series of headsets (HBS-730, 750, 800 and 900), all of which are high end. However, it is also perfect for the more generic HV-series that are offered by a number of brands here.<br /><br />The case is a semi-hard model that has a nice foam insert that holds the headset and houses some accessories, as well as a top that has a mesh pocket for additional items. Although it's semi-hard it can take a lot of abuse and does an excellent job of protecting your phones.<br /><br />Out of the packaging there is a chemical odor that is caused by the synthetic material from which it's made, but that dissipates in hours. After a day it's not at all noticeable.<br /><br />Other features are a decent zipper that operates smoothly and has fine teeth that do not snag, and a pebble-grain textured top and bottom. The latter is actually functional because it's practically non-slip and provides for a tough exterior. Since I am somewhat sight challenges I personally like the bright red trim that makes this easy to spot.

5.0,"fits my Sense, easy to swap out, attractive textured elastic bands are comfy","Nice elastic bands that fit my Fitbit Sense, and fit my 7"" wrist just fine. Lots of room for adjustment. I previously had a Versa 2 (bands with pin attachment), and had purchased elastic bands from this company that I liked a lot. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0925YNWRF<br />Then when my Versa 2 needed to be replaced and I upgraded to Sense, I wanted elastic bands again. I didn't shop around; I just came right back to this brand.<br /><br />I have various bands for different needs. I like the elastic bands for times I just want a different look, and ease of fit. I prefer the regular silicone watch bands for working out, and other high activity days. But for a comfy, attractive, barely there feel especially when going out for dinner or running errands? The elastic style are a must have. They do loosen up over course of day, but are easy enough to tighten back up.<br /><br />This two pack has a textured black elastic band, as well a textured pale pink (""rose pink"") elastic band.

5.0,Solid Basic Phone Case,"It has been a while since I have had an Otterbox phone case. I recently upgraded my phone and wanted a basic clear case for it, and I chose this one. So far I am happy with it.<br /><br />This is a basic, no-frills case for the iPhone 13. As mentioned I chose the clear case and it is very much that - it is not frosted or opaque like another case I have but is absolutely clear.<br /><br />The case is designed for bumper shocks more than anything and it delivers. It has a thick, semi-pliable bumper guard as well as a fair amount of thickness on the back so your phone is well protected. It does a good job with medium height drops and fumbles and it keeps the phone for getting scratched up when jammed in a pocket of briefcase.<br /><br />The button covers work well and the phone is as operable as if I put no case on it at all. I have had no issues with unresponsive buttons related to this case. The speaker, microphone and lightning ports all line up nicely on the bottom as well and the case does not interfere with any of these. Finally, the case comes to the perimeter of the screen but does not actually touch the screen so it does not interfere with screen covers - I major issue I have seen with a few cheap cases in the past.<br /><br />I am pleased with this case and expect to get years of service from it.

5.0,The best for the price ...,"I've gone through 5 or 6 styluses (styli?) since I got my first iPad several years ago.  Started with a relatively expensive one, tried lower priced ones. They all perform about the same, the rubber wears out eventually, etc.<br /><br />When I needed to replace yet another one (I tend to lose them), I noticed this set, and figured for the price, it was a fairly good deal.  I liked the longer tethers, since I can keep it ""plugged in"" while using it, so less chance of losing it.  Ordered them, and I'm NOT disappointed at all!<br /><br />The design is slimmer than the ones I've used in the past, and the tip is smaller, too.  I get more precision when using it, which I really like.  You get replacement tips -- that's a nice touch.  I got the aqua/blue/purple color combination, and the colors are fairly close to the photo (maybe a bit lighter).<br /><br />Overall, I'm VERY happy with this purchase.

5.0,"Simplicity, function and aesthetics","I received a review sample and was immediately taken with the craftsmanship. This is definitely genuine leather, with a finish that is as smooth as butter and a softness that only a fine leather has.<br /><br />However, while I love the look and feel, what impresses me the most is the simple design - it's a case with no pockets, snaps or Velcro. The piece that looks like a flap is really a wide leather hinge that allows you to flip the case open quickly for access to phone functions. There are no card slots or other features that will ultimately make this case bulky. It's simply a case for your phone. Your slip iPhone 5 of 5S will still be slim while being protected by this case.<br /><br />It's not just any case - the flap is padded, so your phone is amply protected when it's closed. Also, the case part into which you slip your phone is all leather, but feels reinforced and has sufficient rigidity to protect the sides and back of your phone. Finally, access to all controls and functions are prefect and precision. Plus there is absolutely no interference with your charging connection (and I tested it with a cable that is known to be problematic for some cases.) A final feature is the cutout for the camera lens and flash do not interfere with that function.<br /><br />Construction is first rate, from high grade leather to stitching that I am betting will outlast the life of your phone.<br /><br />I am more than pleased with this case for all of the reasons cited above and the reasonable price point.",2014-01-21 22:41:43,1,False,simplicity function aesthetic,received review sample immediately taken craftsmanship definitely genuine leather finish smooth butter softness fine leather hasbr br however love look feel impress simple design case pocket snap velcro piece look like flap really wide leather hinge allows flip case open quickly access phone function card slot feature ultimately make case bulky simply case phone slip iphone 5 5 still slim protected casebr br case flap padded phone amply protected closed also case part slip phone leather feel reinforced sufficient rigidity protect side back phone finally access control function prefect precision plus absolutely interference charging connection tested cable known problematic case final feature cutout camera lens flash interfere functionbr br construction first rate high grade leather stitching betting outlast life phonebr br pleased case reason cited reasonable price point,simplicity function aesthetic received review sample immediately taken craftsmanship definitely genuine leather finish smooth butter softness fine leather hasbr br however love look feel impress simple design case pocket snap velcro piece look like flap really wide leather hinge allows flip case open quickly access phone function card slot feature ultimately make case bulky simply case phone slip iphone 5 5 still slim protected casebr br case flap padded phone amply protected closed also case part slip phone leather feel reinforced sufficient rigidity protect side back phone finally access control function prefect precision plus absolutely interference charging connection tested cable known problematic case final feature cutout camera lens flash interfere functionbr br construction first rate high grade leather stitching betting outlast life phonebr br pleased case reason cited reasonable price point,positive,2014,Phone Case

5.0,Cell Phone Bike Mount/Tablet Mount - a Combined Review,"This review is a little different than most I have written in that it covered two products at once. Amazon will not allow two reviews against the same listing, and sometimes multiple products are grouped under the same listing. In order to review both, both products have to be combined in the same review. I received both the bike mount and the tablet mount for testing and review, so I have combined them into this one review. This is possible because they are both excellent products and I would give them the same rating separately. I will review the bike mount first, followed by the tablet mount.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Cell Phone Bike Mount:<br /><br />A bike mount is a specialty item useful to those who spend a lot of time on a bike, for commuting, touring or running trails. It is important to get a good one if you’re going to invest in a mount for your bike, in particular if you are planning to hit the trails off-road. I have come to associate AVANTEK with inexpensive but high-quality electronics and accessories so my expectations were very high for this bike mount. It has not let me down. I did find one minor concern with it that is worth mentioning.<br /><br />I will start with the price - $15.99 as I write this (please be aware that the price can change at some point). There are less expensive bike mounts available but you likely will not find one as good at even a higher price. For the money this is about as well-made and thoughtfully designed mount available.<br /><br />My main cell phone is a Nokia Lumia and I was able to get it to fit in the bracket absolutely perfectly. The bracket is a slider type that adjusts to accommodate just about any cell phone available. There is a latch on the back so that when the bracket is adjusted just right it can be locked into place. It also has a supplementary band to add additional security to keep the phone from coming loose. When I put my phone in the bracket, it did fit but not perfectly until I removed it from it’s normal protective case. This may prove to be a problem for some but at the same time consider that the mount is a form of protection in its own right and you’re not going to drop the phone when it’s in this bracket.<br /><br />With my phone in the harness I picked up the phone mount and shook it very vigorously in an effort to shake my phone free. It did not let my phone escape in this very unrealistic test but it did tell me I can count on this harness to hold my phone securely no matter what kind of terrain I encounter.<br /><br />The clamp that attaches to the handlebar is probably the most impressive part of this whole mount. It works in principle like a pair of vice grip pliers and once tightened has a latch on it that holds it just a little tighter in place and it prevents the clamp from loosening up. The harness clips on to this clamp and snaps into place so it will not shake loose. The base where the harness attaches actually swivels so the phone can be mounted almost anywhere on the bike (within reason).<br /><br />This is an impressive bike mount and you likely will not find one that’s better for even close to the same amount of money. It is very well made, it holds the phone very securely and is very affordable. If you want a phone mount for your phone to go on your bike, give this mount a look.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Tablet Mount:<br /><br />Many people use GPS devices and mobile phones as navigation devices in vehicles. There is no reason that an adequately connected tablet cannot serve the same purpose except that tablets are usually larger and more difficult to secure. Avantek's tablet windshield mount answers this need, though caution is advised when using it due to the size of device for which it is designed. That said, I have found an interesting non-vehicular use for this mount that makes it more useful to me.<br /><br />The mounting harness itself accommodates larger tablets, up to 10&#34;, by employing spring-loaded arms that slide out to allow a larger tablet to fit. Each arm is capped with a molded rubber corner that holds the tablet in place without slipping. The harness also has hard rubber padding that further keeps the tablet in place and reduces play in the grip. When using this mounting solution it is very unlikely that a tablet will come loose.<br /><br />The mount has two jointed connections, one a straight hinge and one a limited-range ball joint, that allows positioning the tablet just right. The ball joint moves smoothly and has infinite angles of positioning. The hinge joint is graduated and with each point (approximately 30) in the joint the position clicks audibly. This type of hinged joint is less prone to slipping, even when not completely tightened.<br /><br />The suction cup on this mounting bracket is one of the largest I have seen. When attached to a glass surface it holds tightly with excellent suction. I suspect that, like all other suction cups I have ever used, it will &#34;let go&#34; when mounted on a cold glass surface, though I am optimistic that it will hold longer than smaller cups.<br /><br />I have one reservation about mounting this to the windshield for a tablet. A large tablet mounted like this will, if not placed properly, interfere with visibility. That said, I was able to position my tablet in such a way as to not appreciably impact my view of the road. I would recommend not using this mount with a 10&#34; tablet in a vehicle with a more narrow field of view out the windshield.<br /><br />I found an alternate use for this bracket that has worked out well for me. Instead of using it in the car, I use the bracket in my home office by mounting it to the window next to my desk. This makes my tablet a lot more accessible without taking up any desk space, it still allows me to grab the tablet and move with it and it allows me to operate the tablet as an appliance while still having my computer up and running at the same time.<br /><br />This is a nice bracket for mounting a tablet that works well. It holds the tablet securely, it adjusts for just about any angle and it holds larger tablets in place. Caution should be used when mounting with a larger tablet to the windshield but when mounted to avoid interfering with visibility it opens up the ability to use the tablet as a GPS (data plan permitting).<br /><br />---<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided samples of these products in exchange for fair, honest and thorough reviews. Even though I received these products at no cost I have rated and reviewed them without bias, based solely on my experiences with them.",2015-01-19 04:26:59,5,False,cell phone bike mounttablet mount

5.0,Excellent reflection and very light weight - do check the measurements before ordering,"I received this as a review sample. When I accepted it I specified Large because the chart in the product photos provided dimensions near to my body size. If you go by the chart in the photo you will receive the correct size. Do measure yourself fully clothed (and with winter attire if you plan to use this is year round) to make sure that you are not disappointed in the fit.<br /><br />This is light weight and made mainly of mesh with reflective strips and velcro fasteners. It comes with highly reflective arm bands as well as a storage bag. It easily folds to fit a backpack and it perfect for bicyclists. I did a night time test with a friend and this was easily spotted with my vehicle's headlights at twenty feet. Probably further, but I did a quick test to ensure that the reflective strips were visible.<br /><br />My only long term concern is the mesh construction. It's tough, but prone to snagging if you are using this in a wooded area. For regular street use I think the construction is more than adequate.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is definitely a good safety solution for pedestrians and cyclists. Do heed my advice about measuring and comparing to the chart in the product photos (and factoring in attire) to make sure you get the correct size.",2016-01-15 02:53:04,0,False,excellent reflection light weight check measurement ordering,received review sample accepted specified large chart product photo provided dimension near body size go chart photo receive correct size measure fully clothed winter attire plan use year round make sure disappointed fitbr br light weight made mainly mesh reflective strip velcro fastener come highly reflective arm band well storage bag easily fold fit backpack perfect bicyclist night time test friend easily spotted vehicle headlight twenty foot probably quick test ensure reflective strip visiblebr br long term concern mesh construction tough prone snagging using wooded area regular street use think construction adequatebr br bottom line definitely good safety solution pedestrian cyclist heed advice measuring comparing chart product photo factoring attire make sure get correct size,excellent reflection light weight check measurement ordering received review sample accepted specified large chart product photo provided dimension near body size go chart photo receive correct size measure fully clothed winter attire plan use year round make sure disappointed fitbr br light weight made mainly mesh reflective strip velcro fastener come highly reflective arm band well storage bag easily fold fit backpack perfect bicyclist night time test friend easily spotted vehicle headlight twenty foot probably quick test ensure reflective strip visiblebr br long term concern mesh construction tough prone snagging using wooded area regular street use think construction adequatebr br bottom line definitely good safety solution pedestrian cyclist heed advice measuring comparing chart product photo factoring attire make sure get correct size,positive,2016,Screen Protector

5.0,Practical Charging Device for Vehicles,"Charging one’s electronics is an ongoing need. This sounds simple enough, but when you’re driving and several family members all start clamoring about the need for more percentage points on their cell phone charge gauge, you could have a real problem. The solution?- a multiple port charging system like the Wishinkle 5 Ports Multi Passenger Car Charger.<br /><br />This car charger is designed to charge several devices from a single cord. You plug it into your car’s socket, and then plug your electronics cords into any one of the 5 ports. The ports are identical, with the exception of the electrical capabilities: 2.4 amps for the two front ports, 2 amps for the three back ports. Just plug in the cord and let the charging begin.<br /><br />The cord for this charger is about 5 feet in length and easily its best quality is the fact that it has ports on both ends. Most multi- port chargers have the ports in one place, right next to where you plug the cord into your car socket. This can make it a challenge sometimes to stretch cords from the back seat to the front, and it can make it difficult for the backseat passengers to continue to use their devices while the charging is taking place because the backseat passengers may not be able to reach. These problems are solved with the Wishinkle charger. The backseat passengers have three ports right there, nearby. They can charge and still use their device with no problem.<br /><br />We use this cord in our SUV and it has made our lives much better. The back part of the cord has a clip and we just attach it to the pocket on the backside of either of our front seats. With this type of arrangement, we just leave the cord permanently plugged in and clipped to the back of the seat. Now, anytime someone needs a charge, they can easily take care of things. They don’t have to say a word.<br /><br />Electronics are here to stay and the need to keep our electronics charged and ready to go is a constant need. The Wishinkle 5 Ports Multi Passenger Car Charger is the solution to our family charging needs and it’s a practical device we are thrilled to have.",2019-10-02 20:39:02,1,False,practical charging device vehicle,charging one electronics ongoing need sound simple enough youre driving several family member start clamoring need percentage point cell phone charge gauge could real problem solution multiple port charging system like wishinkle 5 port multi passenger car chargerbr br car charger designed charge several device single cord plug car socket plug electronics cord one 5 port port identical exception electrical capability 24 amp two front port 2 amp three back port plug cord let charging beginbr br cord charger 5 foot length easily best quality fact port end multi port charger port one place right next plug cord car socket make challenge sometimes stretch cord back seat front make difficult backseat passenger continue use device charging taking place backseat passenger may able reach problem solved wishinkle charger backseat passenger three port right nearby charge still use device problembr br use cord suv made life much better back part cord clip attach pocket backside either front seat type arrangement leave cord permanently plugged clipped back seat anytime someone need charge easily take care thing dont say wordbr br electronics stay need keep electronics charged ready go constant need wishinkle 5 port multi passenger car charger solution family charging need practical device thrilled,practical charging device vehicle charging one electronics ongoing need sound simple enough youre driving several family member start clamoring need percentage point cell phone charge gauge could real problem solution multiple port charging system like wishinkle 5 port multi passenger car chargerbr br car charger designed charge several device single cord plug car socket plug electronics cord one 5 port port identical exception electrical capability 24 amp two front port 2 amp three back port plug cord let charging beginbr br cord charger 5 foot length easily best quality fact port end multi port charger port one place right next plug cord car socket make challenge sometimes stretch cord back seat front make difficult backseat passenger continue use device charging taking place backseat passenger may able reach problem solved wishinkle charger backseat passenger three port right nearby charge still use device problembr br use cord suv made life much better back part cord clip attach pocket backside either front seat type arrangement leave cord permanently plugged clipped back seat anytime someone need charge easily take care thing dont say wordbr br electronics stay need keep electronics charged ready go constant need wishinkle 5 port multi passenger car charger solution family charging need practical device thrilled,positive,2019,Phone Charger

5.0,Best invention ever made.. EVER!!,"I’m in love!! I have to admit- in the past I’ve been using the case with the phone ring built in- as I felt it was safer in the fact, the ring was not going to let loose and ultimately make me drop the phone.. However, I must have smaller hands as, the ring was placed far too high in middle of the phone and was not comfortable at all. The stretch my hands had to try and do was a joke..<br />This is when I decided to try a regular phone case and Adhere my own ring onto the back- Wow!  What a difference it made. When you can choose the placement of the ring… It is actually comfortable, useful and I have never had any problem with adhesive coming loose. In fact, it’s quite the opposite… If you use a ring adhesive on a phone case -be prepared for it to be there for life! Or, at least some residue of it!<br />Being a mom who’s always on the go with x4 kids, a mom who needs to constantly have a phone in hand- this ring is the best invention ever made and a universal life saver. I do know it can be used as a phone stand.. and I’ve had that purpose tried by kids needing entertainment “TV” style. But, I like the fact that in a pinch.. you can be the totally lame mom and spin the phone on the outer side of your hand (like an obnoxious ring!!!) and actually utilize your hands to carry or multitask and trust me-  no matter how much you don’t want to be that person… With this feature, eventually you’ll use it and see how helpful it can be! I made it thru the airport this way- never once having to search or ask- “where in the world did I set my phone..?” the words I may have engraved on my tombstone (no, I’m not proud.. but, it is so fitting these days!)<br /><br />So, if you’re wanting to have the ease of using your phone, carrying it with you and when needed, utilizing the ring to simplify the multi-tasking.. this is a must get. Don’t hesitate about the safety- as the adhesion sticks and does the trick.. you can even hook the ring on any small odd object that pokes out- and that has been just an extra perk I’ve found while using..**life hack: I hang the ring on a cupboard handle when following an online recipe. Boom! The phone hangs perfect at my eye level and makes it so easy to follow along.. but, hands down the best part of having this feature- is the ability to be hands free as needed. All while keeping phone on back side of your hand! And if you’re ever not needing to use the ring- it fold down on itself so, the phone can still slide easily into the back pocket. **note that wireless chargers usually don’t work with this attachment on the back of the phone- it’s placement must be about the same spot as the wireless signal for the battery charging- I point that out, in case it’s a deal breaker for any of you...?!<br /><br />This is simple to put on- but, I suggest before exposing the glue strip.. put your ring on hand as you would use it.. and set phone on top (that way you can move the phone around to different positions.. till you find spot that feels most comfortable.) Then, before you move it to expose the glue strip- just mark the back with a tiny mark/dot.. and this will insure its placed where YOU want it! From there, you just follow the easy step/step instructions.. and that’s it!",2019-08-08 07:48:50,0,False,best invention ever made ever,im love admit past ive using case phone ring built felt safer fact ring going let loose ultimately make drop phone however must smaller hand ring placed far high middle phone comfortable stretch hand try jokebr decided try regular phone case adhere ring onto back wow difference made choose placement ring actually comfortable useful never problem adhesive coming loose fact quite opposite use ring adhesive phone case prepared life least residue itbr mom who always go x4 kid mom need constantly phone hand ring best invention ever made universal life saver know used phone stand ive purpose tried kid needing entertainment tv style like fact pinch totally lame mom spin phone outer side hand like obnoxious ring actually utilize hand carry multitask trust matter much dont want person feature eventually youll use see helpful made thru airport way never search ask world set phone word may engraved tombstone im proud fitting daysbr br youre wanting ease using phone carrying needed utilizing ring simplify multitasking must get dont hesitate safety adhesion stick trick even hook ring small odd object poke extra perk ive found usinglife hack hang ring cupboard handle following online recipe boom phone hang perfect eye level make easy follow along hand best part feature ability hand free needed keeping phone back side hand youre ever needing use ring fold phone still slide easily back pocket note wireless charger usually dont work attachment back phone placement must spot wireless signal battery charging point case deal breaker youbr br simple put suggest exposing glue strip put ring hand would use set phone top way move phone around different position till find spot feel comfortable move expose glue strip mark back tiny markdot insure placed want follow easy stepstep instruction thats,best invention ever made ever im love admit past ive using case phone ring built felt safer fact ring going let loose ultimately make drop phone however must smaller hand ring placed far high middle phone comfortable stretch hand try jokebr decided try regular phone case adhere ring onto back wow difference made choose placement ring actually comfortable useful never problem adhesive coming loose fact quite opposite use ring adhesive phone case prepared life least residue itbr mom who always go x4 kid mom need constantly phone hand ring best invention ever made universal life saver know used phone stand ive purpose tried kid needing entertainment tv style like fact pinch totally lame mom spin phone outer side hand like obnoxious ring actually utilize hand carry multitask trust matter much dont want person feature eventually youll use see helpful made thru airport way never search ask world set phone word may engraved tombstone im proud fitting daysbr br youre wanting ease using phone carrying needed utilizing ring simplify multitasking must get dont hesitate safety adhesion stick trick even hook ring small odd object poke extra perk ive found usinglife hack hang ring cupboard handle following online recipe boom phone hang perfect eye level make easy follow along hand best part feature ability hand free needed keeping phone back side hand youre ever needing use ring fold phone still slide easily back pocket note wireless charger usually dont work attachment back phone placement must spot wireless signal battery charging point case deal breaker youbr br simple put suggest exposing glue strip put ring hand would use set phone top way move phone around different position till find spot feel comfortable move expose glue strip mark back tiny markdot insure placed want follow easy stepstep instruction thats,positive,2019,Phone Case

5.0,Solid peformer and full featured for an entry level smart phone,"I purchased this phone on a two year contract direct from Verizon so am going to focus on the phone without commenting on price, which here is different from the deal that I received.<br /><br />I have had bad experiences with HTC in the past and have been more of a Samsung fan. However, this phone has exceeded my expectations. While I love the Samsung's Note series and have gone through the 2, 3 and 4, this phone is surprisingly close. The difference is the user interface and battery life. The interface is subjective, but the battery life is not in the same league as the Samsung Note 4. On the other hand, this phone has the same solid signal reception as the Samsung, and is every bit as intuitive to use.<br /><br />The screen is easy to read, and photos and video are decent (although not spectacular). Considering that this is more of an entry level phone, however, it is truly packed with features and is fast with web browsing and other network functions. While this is not super quick with games, for regular use it is plenty fast.<br /><br />I added a 32GB SD card, which more than compensated for the relatively small phone's internal memory, and person who I added to my plan and who is using this phone is thrilled.<br /><br />If you are looking for a full featured smartphone at an entry level price, this one - direct from Verizon - is a decent and solid phone that is easy to use.

3.0,"Nice feature, but be careful as construction of plastic is less than very sturdy","To get a decent stand for the Iphone camera, I like this, however, be gentle with the tripod flexible legs, because if you move it too much or too hard, it can become frustrating to get the right position.  And I do like the many ways this tripod can be flexed to fit various structures, plus ability to wrap around a structure for various positioning.  But, be patient with wrapping it and having a secure hold.  And, it is easy to position for landscape or portrait shots.<br /><br />Sometimes the tripod takes some getting used to, some maneuvering around, but in time, you can become more comfortable with setting it up.<br /><br />The snap-on bumper that holds the phone is delicate, be sure you know how to snap it on and remove it.  The clip that holds the phone is also rather delicate plastic.  And, leave it on your Iphone if preferred.  There is also an adaptor that will screw on to hold a digital camera.  That is an added feature to the apparatus, to be able to hold your digital camera.

4.0,"Heavy duty, but thick","This is a good way to add mag safe compatible accessories (chargers, wallets, etc) to phones other than Apple's latest iphones. We used it to add magnetic charging capabilities to a Samsung Galaxy S10 and a Pixel 3, which both worked correctly.<br />It actually works better than the metal ring kinds that I've also seen and tried, the magnetic connection is very strong and feels stuck to the phone enough to hold it in place. The problem, however, is that it is THICK. You can't put it inside a case because it is too thick, it needs to adhere to the back of the case or directly on a phone with no case. The reason it is so thick, we found out, is that the inside is not just a ring of metal but actually tiny little magnetic squares arranged in a circle.

5.0,Received as a gift - very handy!,"I just got this Powermat for the Blackberry Torch and I really like it. It does exactly what it says it will do - charges your Blackberry by simply setting it down on the mat. The initial setup was a bit frustrating - the little connection piece that joins the new battery cover door and the original micro USB insert has to be installed for the mat to send power to your phone. It would have been helpful if the instructions booklet had a slightly better diagrams, but I figured it out. Meanwhile the good stuff.... charges fast! It has a small white light that goes on when your phone is aligned properly on the mat and makes this wierd chirping noise to let you know it is aligned properly and when you move it. (It's a pretty distinct sound - nothing like the little beeps etc your phone normally makes for incoming messages and the like) Honestly I am really liking this whole Powermat idea - no more fumbling with that tiny micro USB charging cord and the plug in on the phone! And the replacement battery cover that you have to use fits properly on my Torch.

But I change them depending on my mood. I am picky when it comes to cases. And I'd prefer not to have one at all but the phone is so slick and thin and delicate that I'm afraid to not protect it somehow. I'm very careful with my phones. So I like the ultra slim cases. I've had other slim cases like the Totalee and one similar, but that material is just still too slick. No grip. That's why this one is perfect for me. It's like a super slim jacket, yet slightly grippy, adding the perfect amount of grip and elegance to the phone. It covers every part of the phone too. I didn't think I'd like that it covers the ports on the bottom but now that I have it on, I think it looks so slick! Such a great deal on this case. I think I might buy another one in a different color. The material is very flexible, but still stays the on the phone nice and snug.

5.0,AWESOME WAY to SANITIZE & CHARGE your PHONE,"Like most people I have seen the many reports about just how many germs we carry on our phones.  It only makes sense - we carry them everywhere and often don’t think about wiping them down.<br /><br />This phone sterilizer by SMARTURTLE is a great solution to this issue. By getting in the habit of using this to charge and sterilize your phone each day you’ll be guaranteed to carry around far fewer germs.<br /><br />Within the sterilizer box there is a Qi charger which I’ve found works without any issue.  After plugging the unit in you’ll be greeted with a voice welcoming you.  Place your phone or any other object of similar size or smaller within and press the button on the left.  The unit will say disinfection in process - the UV light will illuminate and run through the cycle.  There is a button to the right that allows for the use of aromatherapy oils if you wish to freshen scent.<br /><br />Ultra Violet light, such as used by this unit, is what hospitals often use to decontaminate equipment.  It has been clinically proven to kill 99.9% of germs and bacteria.  The size of this unit is ideal easily fitting both our iPhone 8 Plus or iPhone X Plus with their cases still on.<br /><br />We have thoroughly enjoyed having this product and feel this is an easy way to keep our phones free of harmful germs and bacteria.

5.0,Actually does protect,"I recently upgraded one of the phones on my plan to an S5, so when I was offered a review sample of this screen protector I accepted. I know, firsthand, that these tempered glass protectors work because I have one on my Note 3 and when I dropped it and it looked like my screen cracked it turns out it was the protective glass. The screen was unaffected. That glass was a different brand, but nearly identical to this one. And, no, I am not going to drop test this one to see.<br /><br />Installation is relatively simple and straightforward. You do need a steady hand and a good eye, but as importantly, you need to get your phone's screen as clean as possible. You can use the included alcohol swab, but I picked up a trick from a Verizon employee that ensures that it's clean: after swabbing down, let the screen dry, Then take some cellophane tape and lay the sticky side on the screen, then pick up and move to another spot. Repeat until the entire surface has been cleaned that way (and I recommend repeating again to make sure.) The kit includes a 'dust sticker' that works like the cellophane tape I mentioned, but I found the tape to be more effective.<br /><br />Once the screen is clean, peel back a little of the mask on the protector, line up with the screen and apply. Peel back the mask as you lay down the screen. If you have misaligned you can lift and reapply the screen, but that step needs to be done fairly quickly. The final step is to brush out the air bubbles. I used a plastic ruler's edge and a little (not much) pressure. I went vertically, then horizontally, and repeated. From there the screen looked like part of the phone.<br /><br />This protective screen is as sensitive as the screen on the phone. After it was installed my phone reacted to touch the exact same way it did before this protector was applied, and there is no real visual difference either. One final thing: the phone fit in it's case exactly as before the protector was put on. Bottom line: this is probably the best single thing you can get for a new phone. My experience with a different brand of a similar product convinced me.",2014-10-05 12:24:25,3,False,actually protect,recently upgraded one phone plan s5 offered review sample screen protector accepted know firsthand tempered glass protector work one note 3 dropped looked like screen cracked turn protective glass screen unaffected glass different brand nearly identical one going drop test one seebr br installation relatively simple straightforward need steady hand good eye importantly need get phone screen clean possible use included alcohol swab picked trick verizon employee ensures clean swabbing let screen dry take cellophane tape lay sticky side screen pick move another spot repeat entire surface cleaned way recommend repeating make sure kit includes dust sticker work like cellophane tape mentioned found tape effectivebr br screen clean peel back little mask protector line screen apply peel back mask lay screen misaligned lift reapply screen step need done fairly quickly final step brush air bubble used plastic ruler edge little much pressure went vertically horizontally repeated screen looked like part phonebr br protective screen sensitive screen phone installed phone reacted touch exact way protector applied real visual difference either one final thing phone fit case exactly protector put bottom line probably best single thing get new phone experience different brand similar product convinced,actually protect recently upgraded one phone plan s5 offered review sample screen protector accepted know firsthand tempered glass protector work one note 3 dropped looked like screen cracked turn protective glass screen unaffected glass different brand nearly identical one going drop test one seebr br installation relatively simple straightforward need steady hand good eye importantly need get phone screen clean possible use included alcohol swab picked trick verizon employee ensures clean swabbing let screen dry take cellophane tape lay sticky side screen pick move another spot repeat entire surface cleaned way recommend repeating make sure kit includes dust sticker work like cellophane tape mentioned found tape effectivebr br screen clean peel back little mask protector line screen apply peel back mask lay screen misaligned lift reapply screen step need done fairly quickly final step brush air bubble used plastic ruler edge little much pressure went vertically horizontally repeated screen looked like part phonebr br protective screen sensitive screen phone installed phone reacted touch exact way protector applied real visual difference either one final thing phone fit case exactly protector put bottom line probably best single thing get new phone experience different brand similar product convinced,positive,2014,Screen Protector

5.0,AMAZING phone!,"Was taken back at first by the slenderness of this but after using it a while and then using a friend's phone, their phones now seem fat. This one fits in the average hand much better! The fingerprint reader works well. The video quality on this is fantastic and the 120 refresh rate is absolutely a great selling point and why I grabbed it! The slow-motion 4k video is another feature that I love and works amazingly! It's been truly fun playing with the cameras on this! That being said, the front-facing camera is garbage and just almost unusable. I don't know what's going on but the picture is really blurry and grainy on the front-facing cam. The lens is perfectly clean so it's not anything like that.<br /><br />Call quality is great. Very clear audio there and the speakerphone gets plenty loud. The speakers for watching videos/ listening to music are really good and get pretty loud which is nice! The clarity and quality for those speakers are pretty impressive.<br /><br />Phone is very responsive and opens apps quickly. I did have a very annoying glitch going with the facebook messenger and this phone for some reason. The messenger was trying to put things in what it called bubbles and this constantly froze the keyboard no matter what I did. I restarted the phone multiple times, each time I get the same result trying to use messenger- phone freaking out and freezing up the keyboard. I found some way to turn off the bubble thing on the messenger and it stopped this issue. Other than that messenger issue, the phone runs flawlessly and I've had no other problems!<br /><br />I am on 5G with this phone which was a nice surprise! Overall this is an extremely impressive phone! Would I have paid this full price myself? Probably not. I feel like this phone should be a bit cheaper but then again it is pretty new, it might drop in price over time. Overall I love and recommend this phone! I initially didn't know if I'd keep it after reviewing it as I have Motorola I love but this phone is so great that I am definitely going to hold onto it!<br /><br />A minor annoyance is the lack of cases for this. For an almost $1,000 phone we don't have any otterbox style cases available at all, not even off brands!

5.0,Almost Perfect,"First, let me say that I am not a techie. I'm just a normal person who just needs easy to use electronics that work. Very simple. This is my last ditch effort to like an Android phone. I've had three or four Android phones now and none of them have been very impressive.<br />The box arrived and it made me nervous. I opened it and there were no paper instructions. So I hid the box for a few days until I got some quite time to sit and figure it out. Turns out, that wasn't really necessary. It was super simple. Push the power button and it walks you through the entire set up. I didn't even have to call my cell phone provider to switch to the phone. Just popped the SIM card out of one phone and put it in the other. Easy. The phone held my hand and walked me through each step.<br />The screen is impressive. Pictures look so crisp and pretty. The colors are so vivid and I love the to-the-edge image.<br />I really like the fingerprint scanner being on the back. The thumb scanner on the front has never made sense to me. It isnt' a natural way to hold a phone. With this one, the way you naturally pick up the phone unlocks it.<br />The size is great. It isn't so small that I have trouble typing. But not so huge it is awkward.<br />It runs really well. The camera isn't great on it, but you can upgrade it.<br />It has no headphone jack. It does come with an adaptor, but I still have issue with it. Mainly, use in the car. I like to be able to plug my phone in to charge and plug the auxiliary cord in at the same time to run music for the kids while not draining my battery. Now, I have to decide which one I want to do AND I have to make sure I have the adaptor. I know phones are moving away from the auxiliary port, but I hate that they are. It does work with Bluetooth headphones that I have.<br />The finish on it isn't ideal. It is just really shiny all over, so it makes fingerprint smudges all over the phone. A case would easily solve the problem, but since this is a new product, cover options are awfully slim at the moment.<br />Overall, I actually like the phone, which is more than I can say for my previous Android devices.

3.0,Does NOT come with the LED light,"This is a decent kit that can help take your phone's video recording prowess to the next level. As someone who works in video with pro cameras for a living, I can't stress enough how much of a difference it makes to have lights, a proper mic and a stand for the camera... no one wants to see shaking footage with ambient noise louder than your voice!<br />I was a little bit surprised to see it didn't include the LED light in this kit. It clearly shows one on the box, in the instructions, and even on the listing. But upon further inspection, I now see that THIS kit isn't supposed to include the light, there's another version that includes it- the light in the photos here, after all, is just a drawing! That should have given it away, but it wasn't obvious to me from the listing at first. I think they should be more clear about that so that buyers won't expect it.<br />As far as the product itself- it does work quite well to hold your phone and it can be configured in multiple positions and orientations. The microphones worked alright, I particularly like the lavaliere one, since I found the shotgun style one less clear. The shotgun one did, however, have less echo than the phone's built in mic, so I wouldn't totally discount it. It's good to have. However, you'll need a phone with a 3.5mm TRRS input to use this. I happen to have an LG G7 and a V20 that both offer this jack, but many modern phones have removed it. You may need a dongle or other adapter to be able to use these mics at all. These are things that I really feel aren't made clear before you buy the product, and I think should be. That makes it not a bad product, but one that might let buyers down if they have unrealistic expectations of what they are getting. I hope this review helps people avoid only finding that out when they receive it.",2020-02-25 21:52:58,9,False,come led light,decent kit help take phone video recording prowess next level someone work video pro camera living cant stress enough much difference make light proper mic stand camera one want see shaking footage ambient noise louder voicebr little bit surprised see didnt include led light kit clearly show one box instruction even listing upon inspection see kit isnt supposed include light there another version includes light photo drawing given away wasnt obvious listing first think clear buyer wont expect itbr far product work quite well hold phone configured multiple position orientation microphone worked alright particularly like lavaliere one since found shotgun style one less clear shotgun one however less echo phone built mic wouldnt totally discount good however youll need phone 35mm trrs input use happen lg g7 v20 offer jack many modern phone removed may need dongle adapter able use mics thing really feel arent made clear buy product think make bad product one might let buyer unrealistic expectation getting hope review help people avoid finding receive,come led light decent kit help take phone video recording prowess next level someone work video pro camera living cant stress enough much difference make light proper mic stand camera one want see shaking footage ambient noise louder voicebr little bit surprised see didnt include led light kit clearly show one box instruction even listing upon inspection see kit isnt supposed include light there another version includes light photo drawing given away wasnt obvious listing first think clear buyer wont expect itbr far product work quite well hold phone configured multiple position orientation microphone worked alright particularly like lavaliere one since found shotgun style one less clear shotgun one however less echo phone built mic wouldnt totally discount good however youll need phone 35mm trrs input use happen lg g7 v20 offer jack many modern phone removed may need dongle adapter able use mics thing really feel arent made clear buy product think make bad product one might let buyer unrealistic expectation getting hope review help people avoid finding receive,positive,2020,Phone Stand

4.0,Lovely band that has so many conveniences.,"I really do love this watch band.  I pair it with my Galaxy Watch 4, although the listing says that it is for Galaxy Watch 5.  That's not to say there aren't issues with it, though...<br /><br />So instead of going for the sure thing that is the black silicone band, I went for the blue.  I think it really makes the watch stand out on my wrist.  The silicone is soft with a satin finish that is comfortable against my skin.<br /><br />This band has many nice features.  The soft silicone, as I said, is comfortable and flexible.  The clasp mechanism is a quick release that lets you take of the watch very easily.  To adjust the length of the band, there is a little lock on the clasp that allows you to adjust the band, then close the lock and the band stays in place.  This means that the band is infinitely adjustable so that you can get the perfect fit.  The clasp mechanism is magnetic, which is fine for the most part.  Magnets make is easy to clasp and unclasp the watch.<br /><br />So here's the big problem with this band:  The magnetic clasp.  While it is very convenient, it does come off.  I haven't had any issues with it coming apart during day-to-day use, but when I'm active (playing tennis), I do find that it comes apart.  Being silicone, this really should be considered a sports band and if the thing comes apart while playing sports, it kinda defeats the purpose.  I'll probably need to have a little velcro band or rubber band to keep the clasp closed when I play sports.",2022-11-18 22:38:49,0,False,lovely band many convenience,really love watch band pair galaxy watch 4 although listing say galaxy watch 5 thats say arent issue thoughbr br instead going sure thing black silicone band went blue think really make watch stand wrist silicone soft satin finish comfortable skinbr br band many nice feature soft silicone said comfortable flexible clasp mechanism quick release let take watch easily adjust length band little lock clasp allows adjust band close lock band stay place mean band infinitely adjustable get perfect fit clasp mechanism magnetic fine part magnet make easy clasp unclasp watchbr br here big problem band magnetic clasp convenient come havent issue coming apart daytoday use im active playing tennis find come apart silicone really considered sport band thing come apart playing sport kinda defeat purpose ill probably need little velcro band rubber band keep clasp closed play sport,lovely band many convenience really love watch band pair galaxy watch 4 although listing say galaxy watch 5 thats say arent issue thoughbr br instead going sure thing black silicone band went blue think really make watch stand wrist silicone soft satin finish comfortable skinbr br band many nice feature soft silicone said comfortable flexible clasp mechanism quick release let take watch easily adjust length band little lock clasp allows adjust band close lock band stay place mean band infinitely adjustable get perfect fit clasp mechanism magnetic fine part magnet make easy clasp unclasp watchbr br here big problem band magnetic clasp convenient come havent issue coming apart daytoday use im active playing tennis find come apart silicone really considered sport band thing come apart playing sport kinda defeat purpose ill probably need little velcro band rubber band keep clasp closed play sport,positive,2022,Screen Protector

3.0,A slightly updated Nuu model,"I'm no stranger to Nuu handsets, I have owned and reviewed others including a Nuu X6 that I left a favorable review for back in 2019/2020. My kid even used it as a daily driver for over a year back then.<br />It was a good value at the time, not great hardware but you got a lot for your money. Back then, low end handsets were still available with 2GB of ram, so for the money you got a pretty decent display paired with 3GB of RAM and Android 9. It also came with 3 months of prepaid Mint Mobile service in the box, which made it an excellent choice as a starter phone with it's own service- perfect for your kids first handset.<br />Here we are 2.5 years later with an updated handset that has... well, an updated version of the Android OS (Android 11 instead of 9) and not much else. It seems like a similar price point for largely similar hardware. We still have 3 GB RAM and 32 GB storage, and a Mediatek CPU that is mediocre at best. I was hoping it would at least be a faster Mediatek chip but if anything it seems somewhat laggier, although that might just be because the system is still optimizing. Either way, not impressed with the performance so far. That was a good value a couple of years ago but the expectations and demands of mobile devices have changed. The display is bigger, I'll give it that, but it is not a higher resolution.<br />Honestly, it feels like the same handset with similar performance at best, but years later and asking the same money. And this time, it doesn't come with the 3 prepaid months so I can't even say it is as good of a value. Apps demand more resources these days, the newer OS is more optimized for devices with more RAM, and these days even cheap phones can be found with 5G. It just feels like a hard sell now.<br />It's not a BAD device, it get the job done as an unlocked basic phone. But the value feels weak, I was expecting something that felt in 2022 like the X6 did in 2019.

5.0,Passed the crucial test,"When my review sample arrived I immediately put it through the hardest test: synching my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 with my laptop. The reason that test is so difficult is the Note 3 is very finicky about cables when it comes to synching. It will charge with a generic cable (most of the time), but refuses to cooperate with anything but an original Samsung cable and a handful of other brands. It apparently likes this cable, which means that I do as well.<br /><br />I love the indicator light that shows when you are charging (red) as well as when your device is at one hundred percent (blue). The micro USB end fit my phone's [[ASIN:B00GOHUNO6 Fliptroniks Chocolate Panther Leather Wallet Case]], but could be a problem with some phone cases. The dimensions are .5 inches across and .25 inches thick with the actual micro USB connector about .25 inches long. Measure that for clearance before you commit to purchase if you think your case may cause a problem,<br /><br />The cable is long enough for my needs and is well constructed with a beefy outer insulator. It's flexible enough to be used in my car without any tangling problems, so I am very pleased with that aspect as well.  Overall this is truly a five star product based on the way I rate.

5.0,"It is waterproof, weighs nothing, phone can be used without removal from case","I received a sample of this Wiszen waterproof phone case for testing and review and I am glad I accepted it. It weighs nothing and is actually very flexible which means it could easily be packed and taken on vacation or stored in the glove box of your car until needed. It comes with two carrying options - an adjustable velcro strap that slides through the handle on the back or a longer lanyard you could wear around your neck or tie to something. I attached it to my saddle on a trail ride in the woods - protection against water splashing up from stream crossings and my phone wasn't at risk of falling out of my pockets in the woods. The case stayed closed and there was no humidity built up inside or on my phone after a small rain shower while we were getting the horses back to the barn.<br /><br />The clear plastic does allow for operation of the touchscreen display and there is a second clear plastic window on the back so you can shoot pictures without removing your phone. The photos are a little fuzzy, but you do have a barrier in front of the lens. No deduction there. My  one issue was using this with my Fire Phone - the four sensors on the front of the Fire Phone detect any covering as a face and black out the screen entirely. Thus making it impossible to use this with that phone inside. Trying it with my old Galaxy Note 1 was not a problem at all. I was also able to fit my driver's license and a few dollars in the case with the phone - very handy.",2015-04-28 16:22:39,0,False,waterproof weighs nothing phone used without removal case,received sample wiszen waterproof phone case testing review glad accepted weighs nothing actually flexible mean could easily packed taken vacation stored glove box car needed come two carrying option adjustable velcro strap slide handle back longer lanyard could wear around neck tie something attached saddle trail ride wood protection water splashing stream crossing phone wasnt risk falling pocket wood case stayed closed humidity built inside phone small rain shower getting horse back barnbr br clear plastic allow operation touchscreen display second clear plastic window back shoot picture without removing phone photo little fuzzy barrier front lens deduction one issue using fire phone four sensor front fire phone detect covering face black screen entirely thus making impossible use phone inside trying old galaxy note 1 problem also able fit driver license dollar case phone handy,waterproof weighs nothing phone used without removal case received sample wiszen waterproof phone case testing review glad accepted weighs nothing actually flexible mean could easily packed taken vacation stored glove box car needed come two carrying option adjustable velcro strap slide handle back longer lanyard could wear around neck tie something attached saddle trail ride wood protection water splashing stream crossing phone wasnt risk falling pocket wood case stayed closed humidity built inside phone small rain shower getting horse back barnbr br clear plastic allow operation touchscreen display second clear plastic window back shoot picture without removing phone photo little fuzzy barrier front lens deduction one issue using fire phone four sensor front fire phone detect covering face black screen entirely thus making impossible use phone inside trying old galaxy note 1 problem also able fit driver license dollar case phone handy,positive,2015,Phone Case

4.0,Nearly perfect!,"This case is excellent at what it needs to be- namely, protect the phone, look nice, all while also conveniently being a mini-wallet. The buttons are still easy to use (plastic is not too stiff, unlike other wallet phone cases I've used), and the cutouts for the camera and speaker keep it from getting in the way of normal operation.<br />The only issue I've had, is the clearance for the headphone jack on the bottom. When we tried to use the AUX input in our car, my wife couldn't get the plug to go in completely because a bit of the plastic shielding around the phone got in the way. After pulling away at it with a fingernail, I managed to get enough clearance for the plug to go the rest of the way in and work properly, but it seems we have to do this every now when using the jack. I thought about using a pocket knife to make the hole bigger in case it happens again, but I'm afraid of going too far and ripping the plastic, which would then cause the phone not to stay in place any longer.<br />Thankfully, my wife doesn't use wired headphones very often so this hasn't gotten in the way of her thoroughly enjoying the case otherwise. I just think it could have been made better to avoid that problem.<br /><br />Another thing that would have been nice (but not expected), is a magnet for auto-wake. The X Power actually has an auto-sleep/wake feature which uses a magnet on their official flip cover! I had read about this &#34;window view&#34; mode which gets enabled with their official LG cases, where there is a stripe of visible vertical screen that shows alerts, time, etc, when the cover is closed (and it eventually times out to sleep). When the cover opens, it wakes up the phone.<br />I tested this with a refrigerator magnet, and sure enough it works! I tried sticking a thin magnet into the wallet section of the case to emulate this functionality, but it wasn't strong enough. I might try using some adhesive with a stronger magnet in the future. Would be super cool if the third party cases had this magnet!",2017-01-24 04:00:06,0,True,nearly perfect,case excellent need namely protect phone look nice also conveniently miniwallet button still easy use plastic stiff unlike wallet phone case ive used cutout camera speaker keep getting way normal operationbr issue ive clearance headphone jack bottom tried use aux input car wife couldnt get plug go completely bit plastic shielding around phone got way pulling away fingernail managed get enough clearance plug go rest way work properly seems every using jack thought using pocket knife make hole bigger case happens im afraid going far ripping plastic would cause phone stay place longerbr thankfully wife doesnt use wired headphone often hasnt gotten way thoroughly enjoying case otherwise think could made better avoid problembr br another thing would nice expected magnet autowake x power actually autosleepwake feature us magnet official flip cover read 34window view34 mode get enabled official lg case stripe visible vertical screen show alert time etc cover closed eventually time sleep cover open wake phonebr tested refrigerator magnet sure enough work tried sticking thin magnet wallet section case emulate functionality wasnt strong enough might try using adhesive stronger magnet future would super cool third party case magnet,nearly perfect case excellent need namely protect phone look nice also conveniently miniwallet button still easy use plastic stiff unlike wallet phone case ive used cutout camera speaker keep getting way normal operationbr issue ive clearance headphone jack bottom tried use aux input car wife couldnt get plug go completely bit plastic shielding around phone got way pulling away fingernail managed get enough clearance plug go rest way work properly seems every using jack thought using pocket knife make hole bigger case happens im afraid going far ripping plastic would cause phone stay place longerbr thankfully wife doesnt use wired headphone often hasnt gotten way thoroughly enjoying case otherwise think could made better avoid problembr br another thing would nice expected magnet autowake x power actually autosleepwake feature us magnet official flip cover read 34window view34 mode get enabled official lg case stripe visible vertical screen show alert time etc cover closed eventually time sleep cover open wake phonebr tested refrigerator magnet sure enough work tried sticking thin magnet wallet section case emulate functionality wasnt strong enough might try using adhesive stronger magnet future would super cool third party case magnet,positive,2017,Phone Case

5.0,DOESN'T BLOCK CAMERA! Fits the smallest phones. And one hand spring action!,"Pros:<br />This phone case is a godsend because it doesn't block the camera at all. I can take photo and video of my rides and of fun stuff I encounter. Every other bike phone holder I found blocks the camera and many also block part of the screen. (A few won't block the camera if your phone is tall enough, but it has to be huge)<br />It operates one hand, with spring action - no having to unscrew it every time or needing 2 hands to get it in and out or fiddling with rubber corner straps. (It is the ONLY spring action that also doesn't block camera.)<br />It fits my tiny phone.

5.0,Stop Looking and Buy This One. You Won't Find One Better for the Price.,"I teach an after-school photography program and I needed a bunch of tripods for my students. I was tight on cash, so I tried to get the $15 tripod, but that was stupid. They're not meant for SLRs at all. This may have been clear to everyone but me though. After I realized how they weren't going to work for me at all, I scoured Craigslist for a bunch of older Bogen tripods. I spent too much money, but felt good about them. I like finding deals so I paid less than they were worth...but then I found this tripod and realized I had actually wasted a lot of money. The larger, heavier tripods aren't really necessary for what I do. They're great for pros who want to have the biggest, best, and most expensive...which I was, and did, at one point. In my opinion, there's really no need to spend $50-$100 for a used Bogen tripod, or $200+ for a new one. These Ravelli's are sturdy and light weight. The weight is more important that I originally thought too. My students complained about the heavy metal tripods. They wouldn't take them out on their shoots. The Ravelli's are light weight and have the bag...which makes it a lot easier for my students to get out and shoot. Anyways. I really don't think you'll be disappointed with this tripod. I was pleasantly surprised. Frustrated that I spent too much before, but happy that I've found these guys now.

There, you have the BLU line of phones.<br /><br />BLU, Asus (with their line of ZenFones), and other companies are telling the consumer that the phone in their pocket doesn't have to be locked in to (or locked by) your Wireless Carrier and that it doesn't have to cost you the price of a high-end computer.  This is a great trend and I wholeheartedly support it.<br /><br />The BLU Studio 5.0 II is in the lower end BLU's line of phones but it is still impressive for the price.<br /><br />The Good:<br />-  IPS screen means the screen is bright and has good viewing angles<br />-  SIM unlocked means you can use it for any carrier as long as the carrier bands are supported by the cellular chip<br />-  1900 Band for ATT and 1700 band for T-Mobile<br />-  Bloat-free Android 4.2 is fast, efficient, and full of great functionality without the additional crap put in by the major carriers.  Really, do we need TV service from T-Mobile or ATT?<br />- Solid build.  Doesn't feel flimsy in your hand<br />- Includes silicone case.<br />- Dual Sim:  Have one phone for work and one phone for personal use?  Use one phone for both.  Calls coming to and called from each card are clearly marked to minimize confusion.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />-  Low screen resolution.  Coming from a Galaxy S3, the lower resolution took some getting used to.  If this is important to you, look at the higher end BLU phones.<br />-  No LTE.  To be expected for this price.  No great loss for me since my LTE speeds usually are pretty poor anyway.<br />-  Some bad software settings (Reference my tips)<br />-  When using only 1 SIM card, there is always a warning in the notification bar that a second SIM is not inserted.  Hopefully, they will address this with an update.<br /><br />TIPS:<br />-  Set the APN.  The phone comes with a single APN pre-programmed, which is selected by default.  The APN is the address that the phone passes through to get to the Internet.  If you are having a problem with network connection, go in to Settings &#62; Data Networks &#62; Access Point Names and choose the APN for your carrier.  Don't tap on the name of the APN, tap on the radio button to the right of it and make sure the bubble is filled in.<br /><br />-  Only SIM1 can access the HSDPA+ network while the other SIM is limited to the EDGE network.  This is not really an issue since only the Android OS will only use 1 SIM to access the Internet.  You choose which SIM card ALL network traffic will go through so basically put the SIM that has the higher data limit in the SIM1 slot.<br /><br />-  Rename the SIM cards in your settings to better differentiate the sim cards.  Also select to display the SIM cards using the last 4 digits instead of the first 4 (three of which is your area code).<br /><br />So in summary, this is a solid phone with solid support for &#34;mobile&#34; usage (not so great for those who use their phone in lieu of a computer for everything they do on the Internet).  The truth that Samsung doesn't want you to know is that there is really nothing on Android that requires an octacore CPU, or even takes advantage of it.  In fact, while I have not tested XBMC on this phone, my Android HDMI Stick that also has the Mali 400 supports more codecs than Samsung's video chip.",2014-07-07 21:21:05,13,True,bursting mobile carrier bubble,take away bullh contract sim locking carrier fancy 34finger print readers34 build solid android device using lowpriced powerful chipset make sure use ip screen next dual sim capability lastly offer device great price blu line phonesbr br blu asus line zenfones company telling consumer phone pocket doesnt locked locked wireless carrier doesnt cost price highend computer great trend wholeheartedly support itbr br blu studio 50 ii lower end blus line phone still impressive pricebr br goodbr ip screen mean screen bright good viewing anglesbr sim unlocked mean use carrier long carrier band supported cellular chipbr 1900 band att 1700 band tmobilebr bloatfree android 42 fast efficient full great functionality without additional crap put major carrier really need tv service tmobile attbr solid build doesnt feel flimsy handbr includes silicone casebr dual sim one phone work one phone personal use use one phone call coming called card clearly marked minimize confusionbr br badbr low screen resolution coming galaxy s3 lower resolution took getting used important look higher end blu phonesbr lte expected price great loss since lte speed usually pretty poor anywaybr bad software setting reference tipsbr using 1 sim card always warning notification bar second sim inserted hopefully address updatebr br tipsbr set apn phone come single apn preprogrammed selected default apn address phone pass get internet problem network connection go setting 62 data network 62 access point name choose apn carrier dont tap name apn tap radio button right make sure bubble filled inbr br sim1 access hsdpa network sim limited edge network really issue since android o use 1 sim access internet choose sim card network traffic go basically put sim higher data limit sim1 slotbr br rename sim card setting better differentiate sim card also select display sim card using last 4 digit instead first 4 three area codebr br summary solid phone solid support 34mobile34 usage great use phone lieu computer everything internet truth samsung doesnt want know really nothing android requires octacore cpu even take advantage fact tested xbmc phone android hdmi stick also mali 400 support codecs samsungs video chip,bursting mobile carrier bubble take away bullh contract sim locking carrier fancy 34finger print readers34 build solid android device using lowpriced powerful chipset make sure use ip screen next dual sim capability lastly offer device great price blu line phonesbr br blu asus line zenfones company telling consumer phone pocket doesnt locked locked wireless carrier doesnt cost price highend computer great trend wholeheartedly support itbr br blu studio 50 ii lower end blus line phone still impressive pricebr br goodbr ip screen mean screen bright good viewing anglesbr sim unlocked mean use carrier long carrier band supported cellular chipbr 1900 band att 1700 band tmobilebr bloatfree android 42 fast efficient full great functionality without additional crap put major carrier really need tv service tmobile attbr solid build doesnt feel flimsy handbr includes silicone casebr dual sim one phone work one phone personal use use one phone call coming called card clearly marked minimize confusionbr br badbr low screen resolution coming galaxy s3 lower resolution took getting used important look higher end blu phonesbr lte expected price great loss since lte speed usually pretty poor anywaybr bad software setting reference tipsbr using 1 sim card always warning notification bar second sim inserted hopefully address updatebr br tipsbr set apn phone come single apn preprogrammed selected default apn address phone pass get internet problem network connection go setting 62 data network 62 access point name choose apn carrier dont tap name apn tap radio button right make sure bubble filled inbr br sim1 access hsdpa network sim limited edge network really issue since android o use 1 sim access internet choose sim card network traffic go basically put sim higher data limit sim1 slotbr br rename sim card setting better differentiate sim card also select display sim card using last 4 digit instead first 4 three area codebr br summary solid phone solid support 34mobile34 usage great use phone lieu computer everything internet truth samsung doesnt want know really nothing android requires octacore cpu even take advantage fact tested xbmc phone android hdmi stick also mali 400 support codecs samsungs video chip,positive,2014,Phone Case

5.0,"Easy to Apply, No Impact to Responsiveness","I have an iPhone 6s and I have a bad tendency to break my screen protectors on said phone. I am loathe to replace them since they tend to be expensive at the store, and they’re not something I think to buy when I have one that is not broken. I was given an opportunity to test these screen protectors and they have proven to be worth their salt. These are much more affordable than those you buy at a store and they work just as well.<br /><br />These come in a two-pack which is great news for this clumsy fellow. I have a very bad tendency to drop my phone and invariably the screen gets caught right on the edge and the cracks spider out, so having an extra one close by when I do break one again is a good thing. I presently have one of the two applied to my screen and so far it has held up for a couple of weeks. I have dropped my phone a couple of times but so far the screen protector has held.<br /><br />Application is simple and easy. I am used to seeing alcohol wipes in the package with most protectors, but this package did not have one. Everything you need is in there, though. If you are careful and you follow the directions on the package, you end up with a screen protector that fits right and does not have bubbles. I got it right on the first try.<br /><br />The screen protectors do not cover the curve which I have come to regard as a good thing. Screen protectors that wrap around the edges to the metal actually interfere with some phone cases or vice versa.<br /><br />I do like the anti-fingerprint coating which does a decent job of keeping the screen more visible. I dislike a smudged screen so I like how this screen protector helps. It is not 100% fingerprint-proof but it does cut down the prints quite a lot.<br /><br />So far it has not appreciably diminished sensitivity on the screen either. There is certainly some desensitizing that it brings but it is not enough for me to notice. The screen has remained responsive and clear.<br /><br />I have nothing to criticize when it comes to these screen protectors. They go on easy, they fit right, they do not show every last fingerprint and they are substantially less expensive than what you buy in the stores.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

2.0,Fits Too Tightly--Phone Won't Pop Into Case,"This SPECK PRODUCTS SAMSUNG GALAXY S7 EDGE CASE (CANDY SHELL CLEAR, MILITARY GRADE PROTECTIVE) looks wonderful, because it's entirely clear.  It lets my phone's gold color show through--or it would, if the fit weren't so tight that I need a mini-prybar to get it onto the phone!  My Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge simply will NOT pop into this case.  I tried inserting the top first, the bottom first, and each side first, but nothing worked.<br /><br />I think that the case is actually a couple of millimeters too short.  Probably I could force this case onto my phone if I used a tool (maybe a spudger), because the case is slightly stretchy at the top and bottom edges.  I'm not willing to do this, though.  If I shoehorn the case on, I'll never be able to get it off again without scratching or breaking the phone.<br /><br />Because I would like this case a lot if it were a tiny bit larger, and I think it's possible to shoehorn it onto a Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge phone, I rate it at 2 stars (&#34;I don't like it&#34; on the official Amazon scale).<br /><br />EDIT:  The manufacturer commented on another review that there are case installation instructions on its web page.

5.0,Finally found my case!,"For clarification: I purchased this combo package in the black color. That is why it doesn't show this review as an Amazon verified purchase. I thought it would be best to post my review here as well since this is identical to my purchase but for the color.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />My husband and I both have a Droid Razr Maxx. His was purchased October 2, 2012 and mine was purchased March 21, 2013.<br /><br />We originally purchased two [[ASIN:B006WC0U4G Otterbox Commuter Case for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]] as I had an Otterbox on my previous phone (a Droid Incredible 2) and loved it. The silicone flaps covering the access ports on the Otterbox Razr Maxx cases were nothing short of a disappointment. They never seated correctly and were always coming loose and flapping around allowing dust and particles into the ports. One of the reasons for purchasing the Otterbox cases was because it had these port covers. Since those failed to perform correctly these cases were removed from our phones and they have been naked and without protection for about a week now.<br /><br />After extensive research of countless cases and reviews here on Amazon, I purchased this case along with three others in a desperate attempt to find the right case for our Droid Razr Maxx phones, once and for all. The cases purchased and compared were:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00829HLZS Asmyna MOTXT912MHPCSO006NP Premium Durable Protective Case for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX XT912 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0077IQA2K Trident Case AG-XT912-BK AEGIS Case for Motorola Droid Razr MAXX (XT912) - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007KZQNP4 Seidio BD2-HR3MTRM-BK SURFACE Case and Holster Combo for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007PPYXME Seidio BD2-HK3MTRMK-BK ACTIVE Combo with Metal Kickstand for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />First, the Asmyna:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-It is easy to 'install'.<br />-The front and back pieces audibly snap together and seems to hold firm.<br />-It feels good in the hand, being somewhat slick and glossy.<br />-Does not add bulk to an already sizable phone.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-It does not line up properly with the camera, flash, speaker or noise-cancelling speaker on the back of the phone.<br />-It is too slick, causing it to slide off of just about any surface.<br />-It is extremely prone to fingerprints.<br />-All ports are openly exposed to the elements (dust and particle collection, moisture, etc.)<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I would not recommend this case as, for me, its cons outweigh its pros. I also cannot attest to this product's ability to protect a phone from a drop as I did not feel confident that it would stay on the phone upon any kind of impact. So I chose not to submit my $600 phone to what I deemed an imminent death. This case will be returned.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Next, the Trident Aegis:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Sturdy, two part design.<br />-Everything lined up beautifully on my Razr Maxx.<br />-Install was a breeze, with only a little encouraging to get the inner silicone liner to set inside the lip of the outer hard shell casing.<br />-The outer hard shell has two built-in mesh-like dust covers that go over the rear speaker and the noise-cancelling speaker when installed on the phone.<br />-The design on the back of the inside silicone liner pokes through the back of the outer hard shell and slightly raises the phone off any surface it is laying on, thus making the speaker sound un-muffled. This is a difficult feature to find in cases these days (why manufacturers don't just place the speaker on the front of the phone for this very reason, is beyond me).<br />-All ports are covered by silicone flaps.<br />-Accessibility to the MicroSD and Sim cards without case removal.<br />-Power and volume buttons are covered and operate as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-When laying face down, the outer rim of the case provides protection to the touch screen by slightly raising it off of any surface it is placed on.<br />-Adds bulk, but not as much as the Otterbox Commuter case.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-There are two locations (along the edge of the MicroSD and Sim card protection flap and along the front, top, center of the phone - directly above 'Motorola') on the silicone liner where the silicone is in extremely thin strips. I do not see these holding up very long as I can see these ripping or tearing after sufficient use.<br />-The protective flaps are flimsy and do not set into place very well (with the exception of the headphone jack cover, which seats almost too well).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />Even though I have listed more pros than cons, I will not be keeping this case. To me, a cell phone case should be something that you can easily install (and remove if necessary) and not be something that you have to continuously battle to stay in place on your phone. Although it is not a deal breaker for me if a phone has protective flaps over access ports or not - it does matter to me that if a case does have these that they set in place properly and not flap around freely. I also am fearful of the longevity of this case given the thinness of the inner silicone liner. For these reasons, I believe I will be returning this Trident Aegis case.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Next, the Seidio Surface (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Lined up well with the camera, flash, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and all buttons.<br />-Does not add any noticeable bulk.<br />-Exterior surface is has a soft-to-the-touch feeling while remaining hard.<br />-Includes a holster.<br />-MicroSD/Sim card access door area of the case is solid. (This may be a con to others, but I prefer this be solid as I rarely ever need to access my SD or Sim cards.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-No silicone components making it very slick.<br />-Easy to put on the phone, but be prepared for an all out battle to remove it. I spent close to fifteen minutes fighting this thing, trying to coerce it off of my phone. Due to its lack of any silicone, I could not get a good grip on the case and had to turn my phone off as I kept pressing the power and volume buttons in my all out brawl.<br />-All ports are exposed (except the MicroSD and Sim card access door, see Pros list above).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />This case is laughable. It is the only case in my many years of cell phone ownership to cause me so much frustration upon trying to remove it from my phone. The scenario I found myself in while trying to remove the case was very similar to trying to get out of a Chinese finger trap - pretty much every movement makes things worse. I prefer a case to fit snugly, as those offer the best protection because they will not slip or slide on the phone. But this Seidio Surface case, wow.. needless to say, despite the pros I listed for it, this case will be returned.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />And, finally, the Seidio Active (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Does not add much bulk (as compared to the Otterbox Commuter)<br />-Well thought out and functional two part design<br />-Feels good in the hand<br />-Easy to operate while holding in one hand (not too heavy)<br />-Silicone along the edges makes is very easy to grip and keep your grip. This case will rarely slip from your grasp.<br />-All ports and the camera, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and buttons line up perfectly.<br />-Power and volume buttons respond with the same (if not better!) sensitivity as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-The MicroSD and Sim card access door is completely blocked (again, I know some others may prefer to have access to this door, but this is a preference of mine as I hardly ever need to remove/replace these cards).<br />-The kickstand is a fun addition - is functional and seems as though it would last quite awhile as long as you were gentle when pulling it from its seated magnetic position.<br />-Includes a belt holster which fits the phone w/case perfectly.<br />-The phone w/case can be seated in the included holster either facing in or out.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The addition of the kickstand on the back causes the phone to tilt toward the top - this muffles the rear speaker.<br />-With so much silicone exposed on the sides of the phone, I can see the potential for these areas being dust magnets.<br />-The top ports (HDMI, Power and headphone jack) are left openly exposed. Although this is not a deal breaker for me, it may be for others. (NOTE: Because the phone can be inserted into the holster either faced in or out, the holster's clip partially covers the top ports, offering some protection. Not much, but thought I would mention it.)<br />-The retention clip on the holster appears to have a disadvantage because of its design - due to the curve and the distance the clip extends from the phone, I can see this potentially catching on things (seat belts, couches, chairs, etc.) and either breaking the clip entirely, rendering the holster useless and requiring a replacement be purchased OR dislodging the phone from the holster allowing it to fall to the ground.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I believe I finally found the case I have been searching for - the Seidio Active. My husband also chose this case of the four we received and I have reviewed here. So, I guess that means I need to purchase another one for myself. The black is exactly what my husband wanted, but I prefer a color that stands out more.. so I suppose I will be buying the red or blue. Once I receive that case, I will update my review to report on the clarity of the color as opposed to the color depicted here online.<br /><br />Thank you for reading. I hope my search helps someone else find the perfect case for them too (as well as saving them the time of conducting the research!).",2013-07-13 00:51:51,1,False,finally found case,clarification

5.0,Perfect protection,"I just had to test this with a Note II and 3 even though the review sample I received did not list them as compatible. The Note II fit, albeit too tightly to be useful, and the Note 3 was a millimeter or two too wide.<br /><br />For the Note II I was able to perform any task or function that did not involve the S-pen (as expected) or take clear photos. Surprisingly the screen responded to my touches and swipes through the cover as though the phone was not encased in it. Conversations are a bit muffled though (I had to test that function too.)<br /><br />Using this is easy. There are two snaps that tightly seal the top of the case. Unsnap those, insert your phone, realign the sealed halves and close the snaps. I did not have the occasion to test the IPX8 certification claim of the ability to protect the phone to 100 feet submerged. I did submerge the case filled with tissue in a sink and it kept it bone dry. Not a very scientific test, but I had to know.<br /><br />While I am not sure why anyone would want to go diving with their phone, this case is perfect for emergency responders and others who work in harsh, wet environments and want maximum protection against water (or dust) damage. In that respect this is a great investment in protection that normal cases just won't provide.,",2014-03-11 12:02:06,1,False,perfect protection,test note ii 3 even though review sample received list compatible note ii fit albeit tightly useful note 3 millimeter two widebr br note ii able perform task function involve spen expected take clear photo surprisingly screen responded touch swipe cover though phone encased conversation bit muffled though test function toobr br using easy two snap tightly seal top case unsnap insert phone realign sealed half close snap occasion test ipx8 certification claim ability protect phone 100 foot submerged submerge case filled tissue sink kept bone dry scientific test knowbr br sure anyone would want go diving phone case perfect emergency responder others work harsh wet environment want maximum protection water dust damage respect great investment protection normal case wont provide,perfect protection test note ii 3 even though review sample received list compatible note ii fit albeit tightly useful note 3 millimeter two widebr br note ii able perform task function involve spen expected take clear photo surprisingly screen responded touch swipe cover though phone encased conversation bit muffled though test function toobr br using easy two snap tightly seal top case unsnap insert phone realign sealed half close snap occasion test ipx8 certification claim ability protect phone 100 foot submerged submerge case filled tissue sink kept bone dry scientific test knowbr br sure anyone would want go diving phone case perfect emergency responder others work harsh wet environment want maximum protection water dust damage respect great investment protection normal case wont provide,positive,2014,Phone Case

1.0,Would not purchase again,"As with other reviewers, I report that the case does read &#34;made in korea&#34; inside... probably NOT LG. The &#34;G4&#34; shown embossed in the ad picture is NOT on the case.  The sticker on the box says &#34;genuine OEM Original LG Leather.&#34;  Probably not.  And most likely NOT leather.  The outside is NOT at all &#34;soft&#34; as reported by another reviewer... at least mine is not.  It is textured and hard. It is &#34;matte&#34; finished, sort of leather &#34;like.&#34;  The inside is a plastic-like material, no way to really see if the outside is leather or just a textured plastic itself.  It does fit, all the slots and holes are accurate. I have a sparkle/clear outer case (purchased at the Sprint store when I got the phone) that I use over the whole backside that provides a rubber bumper that covers the edges completely and then the outer plastic cover also provides a &#34;lip&#34; that protects the glass if the phone is dropped.  The pink shows through nicely, tho it is a very light pink. I think the photo is fairly close to reality (at least to the one I received). In my opinion, you'll be paying $70 for a back that is worth about $5 and that is being very generous.  Honestly, I would pass unless you just really want the &#34;look&#34; they advertise on TV all the time.  However reviews are ALL subjective and personal.  Everyone should make choices and decide for themselves. I will update with any wear or other issues. I hope this has helped in some way even if you don't agree.

4.0,Clear and protected.,"The Primeoneusa iPhone case is inexpensive and easy to apply. It protects your phone from dirt and damage. The clear cover does not cover any of the openings/holes for charging or the camera. Since it is clear, it will accent your phone no matter the color. It fits well and snug. It is easy to hold and comfortable in your hands. And finally, it is inexpensive (under $20). Overall, I’d recommend it.",2020-01-06 00:24:42,0,False,clear protected,primeoneusa iphone case inexpensive easy apply protects phone dirt damage clear cover cover openingsholes charging camera since clear accent phone matter color fit well snug easy hold comfortable hand finally inexpensive 20 overall id recommend,clear protected primeoneusa iphone case inexpensive easy apply protects phone dirt damage clear cover cover openingsholes charging camera since clear accent phone matter color fit well snug easy hold comfortable hand finally inexpensive 20 overall id recommend,positive,2020,Phone Case
5.0,"tiny but mighty! basic, slim, ultra lightweight, inexpensive","These really do work. There is nothing to them- super light and small (fits in palm of my hand!) and so you may think that they just wont be sturdy enough, but I am able to prop up my smartphone or my large table without issue. These stands close up nearly flat, and at just 3.25""x 2.75 they will travel well. There are multiple angles you can set your device at. There are rubbery grips on four corners underside, and one grip strip where device rests. I have a larger, heavy (and more expensive) style for when I know I will be doing a lot of tapping/applying pressure, but this style is holding steady when I use it. Overall I consider these light weight ones good for light use- just want to phone or tablet propped up hands free.<br /><br />Price for 2 is ok, price per unit is better on the larger quantity/multi packs.<br /><br />So if you are looking for a basic, slim, ultra lightweight, grippy, inexpensive phone/tablet holder then this product should be adequate.

My daughter perpetually has a dying phone battery so this is a welcome addition to her accessories since she can snap it to the back and keep going about her day.<br />It is a little bulkier and heavier than she'd like it to be, to be honest. It weighs down the phone and it did fall off the first time she tried it (to be fair, she didn't have it lined up correctly, but it was a heavy THUD to the floor). But it does work as a convenient way to charge without cables on the go, and better than a wireless charger that you need to put down and not touch.

4.0,Sleek power bank for your EDC needs,"The Momax powerbank comes in a decent package. It claimes to have a textured woven design. Initially I thought it would be like those pixel cases but it's not like that. It doesn't feel like cloth but rather a bit plastic-y but with a textured finish. Just a minor observation.<br /><br />The powerbank itself is sleek and lightweight. It has 1 USB 2.0 output for your cables with QC 3.0. For input it has 1 usb C and 1 lightning port. Which is great for both android and ios users. It has 10000mah battery which means you can keep it in your backpack and not worry about it for a while. Although it claims to charge 50% in 30mins but it was more like 30% in 30mins (using OnePlus Nord with 30w warp charging capabilities)<br /><br />It has wireless charging capabilities (10w) and it can charge smaller devices with it's low charging option (double click the button). The LED indicators aren't the great. Sometimes it's not clear as light bleeds from one LED to the next.<br /><br />In conclusion this is an excellent powerbank. It is sleek, lightweight and holds enough charge for most of your portable device charging needs<br /><br />Pros -<br />10000mah is more than enough<br />20w fast charging<br />10w wireless charging<br />Low charging mode for earbuds and smaller devices<br />Lightweight and modern<br /><br />Cons -<br />Charging time is average.<br />The battery indicators can be better",2022-05-06 03:46:06,0,False,sleek power bank edc need,momax powerbank come decent package claimes textured woven design initially thought would like pixel case like doesnt feel like cloth rather bit plasticy textured finish minor observationbr br powerbank sleek lightweight 1 usb 20 output cable qc 30 input 1 usb c 1 lightning port great android io user 10000mah battery mean keep backpack worry although claim charge 50 30mins like 30 30mins using oneplus nord 30w warp charging capabilitiesbr br wireless charging capability 10w charge smaller device low charging option double click button led indicator arent great sometimes clear light bleeds one led nextbr br conclusion excellent powerbank sleek lightweight hold enough charge portable device charging needsbr br pro br 10000mah enoughbr 20w fast chargingbr 10w wireless chargingbr low charging mode earbuds smaller devicesbr lightweight modernbr br con br charging time averagebr battery indicator better,sleek power bank edc need momax powerbank come decent package claimes textured woven design initially thought would like pixel case like doesnt feel like cloth rather bit plasticy textured finish minor observationbr br powerbank sleek lightweight 1 usb 20 output cable qc 30 input 1 usb c 1 lightning port great android io user 10000mah battery mean keep backpack worry although claim charge 50 30mins like 30 30mins using oneplus nord 30w warp charging capabilitiesbr br wireless charging capability 10w charge smaller device low charging option double click button led indicator arent great sometimes clear light bleeds one led nextbr br conclusion excellent powerbank sleek lightweight hold enough charge portable device charging needsbr br pro br 10000mah enoughbr 20w fast chargingbr 10w wireless chargingbr low charging mode earbuds smaller devicesbr lightweight modernbr br con br charging time averagebr battery indicator better,positive,2022,Screen Protector

4.0,"A Sturdy Mount, Keeps Your Phone Steady","This is a more solid bike mount than some others we have tried. If you need something a little more sturdy, this will do the job. It takes a little more effort than some other types to remove your phone, but it's also held securely quite well. If you do short trips and need to grab and go, then this may slow you down a little bit. Each movement will require the thumb screws to be manipulated. It's not unreasonable to believe that with time, the threads will become worn and stripped. With regular use, this should last a couple years. However, it's solid metal and can withstand some conditions that simple silicone and plastic mounts will not tolerate as well.<br /><br />My son has been using it, and he likes it. There are two options listed, so make sure you order the one that meets your needs best. I do believe some others may have picked the option that had less parts and found the product to be disappointing, so that's something to keep in mind.<br /><br />You don't need anything other than a place to mount the Bicycle & Motorcycle Universal Phone Mount. It could also mount on nearly any other tube, like exercise equipment or a wire shelf.<br /><br />Thank you so much for reading my review.

5.0,"so far so good, fits great on 4Xl, no interference with anything","FANTASTIC (so far). I bought a flip cover wallet case for my new Google Pixel 4XL, and my experience with my 3XL and a wallet case is that the bank cards were etching the screen. Not wanting to repeat that mistake, I made a point to purchase the screen protector that I could put on the moment the phone arrived.<br /><br />The protector went on easily. Since I put it on as soon as the phone arrived, the screen hadn't any opportunity to get smudge marks or fibers on it, so I didn't need the accompanying tools to help with that. I simply eyeballed the screen protector over the screen, and let it drop gently into place. I nailed it in terms of setting it on perfectly, and I didn't have to fuss. Any bubbles that presented once I pressed down were easily pressed out.<br /><br />Prior to buying this set of screen protectors, I had asked the question to the community (or company) whether or not the material creates a haze around the front facing camera lens. No answer, but now I can answer in case anyone is wondering. See, with my 3XL any tempered glass protectors were too thick around the lens. It created a hazy halo with the front facing camera (selfies, I guess). The way the old phones were set up, the protectors had a cut out around the lens.  The cut outs were weird because the top portion of the layout on the phone was weird. They fixed that with the 4xl. Anyway, the cut outs were barely any bigger than the lens. I am a master at lining up protectors, so it wasn't a matter of failed placement, it was more a matter of design on the 3xl along with the thickness of the protector. I wanted to avoid that going forward- ie; not bother to buy the protector if it was just going to be like that again, but I went ahead and ordered it as I waited for my phone to arrive.<br /><br />Forward to everything arriving and setting everything up. The protectors fit fine, easy to put on, the protector does not surround the camera eye, so there is no risk of creating a haze (unless maybe you put it on wrong). SO much better!!<br /><br />It is still early on for use of this screen protector.

5.0,Definjitely genuine leather and not a bad grade either,"For the price this exceeded my expectations. I was expecting faux leather at worse, or a very poor grade at best. While the material is not 'fine Italian' leather, it's not bad. Pretty good in fact. You can clearly see the grain, and it smells like the real thing too.<br /><br />Fit is perfect. All of the cutouts for buttons, cameras and charging connection fit as though Samsung designed this case. Even the rather large Samsung USB 3.0 charging and data connector fit without any interference from the case. Other cases I have tried has issues there.<br /><br />The main value is the protection, and it does a wonderful job. The plastic part into which you snap in the phone is sturdy and firmly holds the phone in place. The leather exterior provides some padding that takes the protection a step further, and the snap tab is non-magnetic, so your S-Pen is not going to act funny.<br /><br />I can fit a Florida driver's license and two standard size credit/debit cards in the the slots in the top flap without any problem (or adding bulk). The currency part will not take US bills unless they are folded because the wallet part is a few fractions of an inch too short. It is the perfect width for US currency though.<br /><br />This was supposed to be an interim case until I had the funds to order a truly high end one.

5.0,"Nice, inexpensive set of lenses that are near universal","I received this set as a free review sample. This is not a pro quality kit, and it's priced accordingly. What it is, though, is a fun set of lenses that give you some interesting choices when using your phone or tablet for stills and even video.<br /><br />There are a few things that you need to know so you are not disappointed. Placing the lens holder over you device's camera lens needs to be precise. If you do not take the time to perfectly align them you will get a shadow or even a partial photo. Also, if your device's flash gets partially covered you will get some ruined shots as well. That is the price you pay for a universal fit that will accommodate most phones and tablets.<br /><br />This set fit my Samsung Note 3 phone, as well as both my Tab 3 10.1 and Tab Pro 12.2 tablets. The jaws of the clamp open a full 1/4 inch, so the claim that it will work with most covers is accurate. Some of the hardened cases may be a problem, but my thick, leather case was not a problem at all. You can also reach any device lens that is 11/16 of an inch or less from the device's edge, so this kit should work with 99% of the phones and tablets currently on the market.<br /><br />Each of the effects were as good as any of other universal lens kits that I have used. The fisheye was nothing special, but it worked as well as any. I like the macro lens the most because I was able to capture small details with the entire object and background in focus. My phone's camera gets a lot of credit for that, but the clip on lens consistently produced clear photos with decent detail. The wide angle piggy backs onto the macro lens, so when you open the package you are not being shortchanged - the third lens is screwed into the macro.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is an inexpensive way to add some interesting effects and capabilities to your device's internal camera. There are some tradeoffs, and you do need to take some care in how you position the lenses, but when you have them aligned (without hampering with the flash) the results are impressive.",2015-07-05 14:33:37,3,False,nice inexpensive set lens near universal,received set free review sample pro quality kit priced accordingly though fun set lens give interesting choice using phone tablet still even videobr br thing need know disappointed placing lens holder device camera lens need precise take time perfectly align get shadow even partial photo also device flash get partially covered get ruined shot well price pay universal fit accommodate phone tabletsbr br set fit samsung note 3 phone well tab 3 101 tab pro 122 tablet jaw clamp open full 14 inch claim work cover accurate hardened case may problem thick leather case problem also reach device lens 1116 inch less device edge kit work 99 phone tablet currently marketbr br effect good universal lens kit used fisheye nothing special worked well like macro lens able capture small detail entire object background focus phone camera get lot credit clip lens consistently produced clear photo decent detail wide angle piggy back onto macro lens open package shortchanged third lens screwed macrobr br bottom line inexpensive way add interesting effect capability device internal camera tradeoff need take care position lens aligned without hampering flash result impressive,nice inexpensive set lens near universal received set free review sample pro quality kit priced accordingly though fun set lens give interesting choice using phone tablet still even videobr br thing need know disappointed placing lens holder device camera lens need precise take time perfectly align get shadow even partial photo also device flash get partially covered get ruined shot well price pay universal fit accommodate phone tabletsbr br set fit samsung note 3 phone well tab 3 101 tab pro 122 tablet jaw clamp open full 14 inch claim work cover accurate hardened case may problem thick leather case problem also reach device lens 1116 inch less device edge kit work 99 phone tablet currently marketbr br effect good universal lens kit used fisheye nothing special worked well like macro lens able capture small detail entire object background focus phone camera get lot credit clip lens consistently produced clear photo decent detail wide angle piggy back onto macro lens open package shortchanged third lens screwed macrobr br bottom line inexpensive way add interesting effect capability device internal camera tradeoff need take care position lens aligned without hampering flash result impressive,positive,2015,Phone Holder

5.0,Well constructed and passed the synch test,"Like the previous reviewer I received a four pack as a review sample. My first test of any USB cable is to see if it will support synching between my laptop and my Samsung Note 3 and Tab 3 10.1. Both of those are finicky when it comes to synching, although neither seems to care about cable quality when it comes to charging.<br /><br />Both devices synched and supported file transfers to and from an old ThinkPad T61<br /><br />Another test to which I put micro USB cables is to check the fit on my Note 3, which has a charging and synching port based on USB 3.0. USB 2.0 micro cables can be plugged into the right side of the port and perform both charging and synching, although the synching is at a lower speed. Some cables I have used were too tight a fit to that port and I could not use them for even charging. This one fit as though it was made for it. So, it passed another test.<br /><br />Finally, the cable has strain reliefs on each end, although the micro end looks a little small. Time will tell on that one. The insulating outer cover is shiny and the cable is a little stiffer than most. I am not sure why or what pros or cons it carries. For now I am giving this set five stars for the reasons mentioned above. If I experience premature failure I'll update this review accordingly.

2.0,Disappointing RGB Qi Charger,"As someone who loves colored lights and all tech things I was excited to test and review this RGB Qi charger. I’ve been using it for a couple of months and have been really disappointed with the quality.<br /><br />In terms of design there are some facets that are quite good - your phone can charge through even a beefy case which is often not the case with Qi chargers, a definite plus.  In addition, you can charge your phone in either a vertical or horizontal position, which is great if you want to use the phone while charging.<br /><br />The ports on the back are handy for charging other devices as to keep everything contained and they work well.  It’s handy that a super fast USB C port is included as this is the newest of charging technologies and definitely the fastest.<br /><br />Now on to the flaws in this device.  When manufacturing an RGB device why not have the colors mean something?  The light below the phone turns white when the phone is placed on the charger, white while charging and white when completed charging.  Seems like this would be an ideal opportunity to make use of the RGB lights in a functional way.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is the noise.  Over the course of using this the last couple of months it has become louder and louder. I have cleaned the vents yet the sound persists.  I started with this on my nightstand therefore this was definitely an issue.  The sounds go from a high pitched screech to a lower pitched fan blade rubbing sound - both very irritating.  I have done everything I can to eliminate the sound without success.

5.0,Basic protection and convenience with some flaws,"I purchased this and another color - [[ASIN:B00842ANMQ Black/Blue]] - for a friend who loved both colors and could not make up her mind. Considering the extremely low price I could afford the risk of receiving absolute junk. Fortunately it turned out to be an amazing value - but not without a few flaws.<br /><br />For basic protection and good looks this case is hard to beat. There are a few small details that were either overlooked or considered 'good enough' by the manufacturer, which I'll get into, but then this case cost less than five bucks shipped.<br /><br />The strongest factor is the material and the way it has been cut and assembled afford excellent protection for your phone. The wallet and card slots are very nice touches that add functionality to the case.<br /><br />Plus it's simply beautiful.<br /><br />There are a few minor issues with the case that need to be disclosed. First, the fit and cut-outs are not precise. The part that holds the phone in place is a little loose and imperfectly measured. This causes the phone to slide a little to the left in the holder, which makes accessing keys on the left side of the screen keyboard difficult. You can still use the keyboard, but with some difficulty. See one of the photos that I uploaded for a visual. Also note that the part that secures the phone is somewhat larger than the phone, which results in a loose fit. The phone will slide out too easily and possible fall if you are not careful. Forewarned is fore armed.<br /><br />Two other very minor issues are: (1) imprecise way the cut-out is aligned to the camera lens (this is more of a aesthetic defect because it does not hamper taking photos). (2) a loose stitch right at flap that can easily be trimmed. Both are documented in the photos I've uploaded. I thought the loose stitch was a fluke, but it's a flaw on both this one and the other one I purchased.<br /><br />Minor issues notwithstanding, this case is a bargain, and an eye-catching one at that. I personally feel that you cannot go wrong with it.",2013-02-20 13:48:29,0,True,basic protection convenience flaw,purchased another color asinb00842anmq blackblue friend loved color could make mind considering extremely low price could afford risk receiving absolute junk fortunately turned amazing value without flawsbr br basic protection good look case hard beat small detail either overlooked considered good enough manufacturer ill get case cost less five buck shippedbr br strongest factor material way cut assembled afford excellent protection phone wallet card slot nice touch add functionality casebr br plus simply beautifulbr br minor issue case need disclosed first fit cutout precise part hold phone place little loose imperfectly measured cause phone slide little left holder make accessing key left side screen keyboard difficult still use keyboard difficulty see one photo uploaded visual also note part secures phone somewhat larger phone result loose fit phone slide easily possible fall careful forewarned fore armedbr br two minor issue 1 imprecise way cutout aligned camera lens aesthetic defect hamper taking photo 2 loose stitch right flap easily trimmed documented photo ive uploaded thought loose stitch fluke flaw one one purchasedbr br minor issue notwithstanding case bargain eyecatching one personally feel go wrong,basic protection convenience flaw purchased another color asinb00842anmq blackblue friend loved color could make mind considering extremely low price could afford risk receiving absolute junk fortunately turned amazing value without flawsbr br basic protection good look case hard beat small detail either overlooked considered good enough manufacturer ill get case cost less five buck shippedbr br strongest factor material way cut assembled afford excellent protection phone wallet card slot nice touch add functionality casebr br plus simply beautifulbr br minor issue case need disclosed first fit cutout precise part hold phone place little loose imperfectly measured cause phone slide little left holder make accessing key left side screen keyboard difficult still use keyboard difficulty see one photo uploaded visual also note part secures phone somewhat larger phone result loose fit phone slide easily possible fall careful forewarned fore armedbr br two minor issue 1 imprecise way cutout aligned camera lens aesthetic defect hamper taking photo 2 loose stitch right flap easily trimmed documented photo ive uploaded thought loose stitch fluke flaw one one purchasedbr br minor issue notwithstanding case bargain eyecatching one personally feel go wrong,positive,2013,Phone Case
2.0,Two-foot drop renders it useless. Too expense for what it is.,"When I had an iPhone 5 I had a Belkin battery case that worked great. Sure, the battery life lost its longevity over time, but I never had an issue with it breaking or damaging my iPhone. When I upgraded to an iPhone 6 I knew I had to get a battery case because there was no way I was going to live without one!<br /><br />I was offered a chance to get this and didn't hesitate.<br /><br />When it arrived I immediately loved the way it felt. I'm not sure what the material is, but it has a soft feel to it that makes it easy to grip. There are patterns on the back that run diagonal that also aid to its usability.<br />I initially found the &#34;security&#34; features to be a bit cheesy, but then grew to like them over time. The physical security features are basically just a slider to cover the two cameras. At first I though it unnecessary, but then I realized I often slid the the cover over the compartments when my daughter had my phone. Then I didn't have to worry about her taking pictures with them on.<br /><br />To utilize the main feature of this case, however, you have to slide another lever at the bottom half which holds the battery. The logo of the company indicates the battery life, and by sliding the switch you charge your phone. There's a recessed button to the left of the logo which indicates how much battery life is left in the case itself.<br /><br />However, after a small incident the case was rendered useless.<br />I knew the materials used for the switches felt a bit cheap when I used them but I didn't think much of them because they worked. But yesterday I accidentally dropped the phone from my pocket as I grabbed it; I was in my bathroom so it fell on a soft floor. I'm not a very tall person, so I'd say the drop distance was about 2-3 feet max. When I picked up my phone I found a crack on my phone's screen. Initially I was panicked but then realized that it was of the glass screen protector, which easily can be replaced.<br />Later in the day, after putting my phone on silent, I heard the phone go off during a conversation. I thought it odd and switched it off again. That's when I realized that the switch to put the phone on silent had broken. I had to force it to turn the phone on and off silent.<br /><br />Then, when I was back home and wanted to charge the battery using the case, I realized that the battery slider had broken. Earlier I indicated that, in order to charge the phone by the case, you had to switch a slider at the bottom. Well, that slider slides no more. I tried forcing it to the charge side and it won't budge, not even a smidgen.<br /><br />I'm pretty bummed. Not only did the case not protect my phone from a small fall, but the case itself broke in several places. There was also a small crack in the case near the top. All of that from a short fall onto my bathroom floor.<br /><br />The only major gripe I had before this incident was that the case often came apart. It attaches onto the phone in two pieces, and because I wear somewhat fitted jeans the case usually came apart in my hand when taking out the phone from my pocket. It wasn't a deal-breaker more than it was an inconvenience, but now after yesterday I have many gripes about the phone.<br /><br />I miss my Belkin case from my old phone. Sure, it wasn't the best case I've ever used but at least it prevented my phone from damage from the three small drops I've caused it in two years, all the while keeping a charge over 70%. And it was $40 cheaper than this model, and that's considering I first received the Belkin case two years ago.<br /><br />I'll update this review as time goes on.<br /><br />***UPDATE 7/21/15***<br />I had contacted the company immediately after this review, and they responded the next day. They indicated that they had worked on an update to the case and will send me a replacement. That was over a week ago and I haven't heard back, let alone received the replacement. I contacted them again yesterday to follow up.

3.0,"Great looking, but of dubious quality","I'll review this in two parts, the looks and the functionality.  The case looks great, and the pinstripe fabric is truly a unique look for the iPhone.  With that said it's quite bulky and adds considerable heft to my iPhone, although since it's such a slim phone to begin with it really doesn't bother me overall.<br /><br />As for the build quality, I had my first drop in the house after having the case for a day.  The two halves attach together in 3 places, on the sides and at the top.  The top clip is very small piece of plastic, maybe 2mm wide, although there is room for a much wider clip.  This immediately shattered when I dropped the phone, and the case exploded, leaving my iPhone and the two halves of the case on the ground.  I'm worried what will happen if I drop it on a more dangerous surface outside.  Now the case doesn't fit as securely because it's only attached on the sides, and I can't see how in testing they couldn't determine that piece would snap off really easily.  I think the attachment between the two halves should be a lot more secure so it just doesn't come apart when dropped ... I mean, isn't the point that it protects the phone when it's dropped?<br /><br />Good effort speck, but if I didn't love the way this looked so much I'd have a new case on there already.",2009-07-28 06:07:10,0,True,great looking dubious quality,ill review two part look functionality case look great pinstripe fabric truly unique look iphone said quite bulky add considerable heft iphone although since slim phone begin really doesnt bother overallbr br build quality first drop house case day two half attach together 3 place side top top clip small piece plastic maybe 2mm wide although room much wider clip immediately shattered dropped phone case exploded leaving iphone two half case ground im worried happen drop dangerous surface outside case doesnt fit securely attached side cant see testing couldnt determine piece would snap really easily think attachment two half lot secure doesnt come apart dropped mean isnt point protects phone droppedbr br good effort speck didnt love way looked much id new case already,great looking dubious quality ill review two part look functionality case look great pinstripe fabric truly unique look iphone said quite bulky add considerable heft iphone although since slim phone begin really doesnt bother overallbr br build quality first drop house case day two half attach together 3 place side top top clip small piece plastic maybe 2mm wide although room much wider clip immediately shattered dropped phone case exploded leaving iphone two half case ground im worried happen drop dangerous surface outside case doesnt fit securely attached side cant see testing couldnt determine piece would snap really easily think attachment two half lot secure doesnt come apart dropped mean isnt point protects phone droppedbr br good effort speck didnt love way looked much id new case already,positive,2009,Phone Case

5.0,"great colors, adds protection to Sides AND touch Screen, easy on/off","5 stars. I had purchased another brand and loved them, and eventually I wanted more but in different colors. I figured I loved my other ones so I should love these as well. They go on easily, comes off easily as needed, are bright shiny attractive colors, work really well as a bumper and screen protector, and are budget friendly.<br /><br />First, what I like:<br />--I like the variety of colors available. Adds a little pop of color against my basic black band (or added pop of color to my colorful bands)<br />--Easy on, easy off. The covers are flexible and simply pop on, or pull off when you want to change it out or when you need to charge your VERSA 2. These need to come off when charging as stated in the product description.<br />--I can use buttons and touch screen no problem, no different than without the protector on.<br />--No scratching or rubbing from this YAY<br />--provides some protection to screen and sides. When I first tried my Versa 2 (a christmas gift 2019), I noticed that I would easily bang into things, even more so than the Blaze I had prior. I immediately set out to find a screen protector and was very happy to find these bumpers- it was basically exactly what I was looking for- protection on screen AND sides!<br /><br />What I do not like (minimal, but worth mentioning):<br />--having to take off before charging, but since it is so easy to take off and put on, it really isn't a problem for me.<br />--*potential to fall off.  It is a rare thing, and isn't enough of a problem to keep me from using these. I figure I would rather this get banged than the edges of my Versa2 get hit. The protectors will eventually loosen up a little, and that it when there is a potential to fall off when it gets caught on something. Truly minimal issue.<br /><br />I have the four pack that contains Rose Gold/Jade Green/Purple/Red. I am currently using the ""jade green"" which I call turquoise. Looks great with a colorful band that has a little of that color in it.<br /><br />Currently comfortable with full rating. However, I am an avid reviewer, and will absolutely come back if I learn anything new or discover something worth sharing about these- good or bad. So far so good, and I hope I continue to be highly pleased with them.

4.0,Elegant Device With A Few Quirks,"I moved to a Lumia 822 Windows Phone after having had a first generation Droid for several years. I was happy with my Droid and it worked well, but after it finally started to degrade it was time to move to a new phone. I decided to try the Windows phone platform for no reason other than wanting something different, and of the options available to me I was most impressed with the Lumia 822. I wish I had made this switch a while ago...<br /><br />The Lumia is a larger phone than my original Droid, and I was a little apprehensive when I bought it because of this. My concern was that it would be bulky and would be cumbersome to use, but this has not been the case. It fits almost perfectly in a pants pocket and it is just the right size when in operation for comfortable talk. It is large enough to allow for talking into the actual receiver instead of relying on the way someone holds the phone which means consistent sound clarity for the person on the other end.<br /><br />Call quality has been great. So far I have had no issues with the ability to speak and be heard in a call. In fact, when switching between speaker phone and regular calling mode the person on the other end has said that they cannot always tell the difference. This was an unexpected bonus - most phones I have used do not work as well as speaker phones.<br /><br />It is important to understand that this phone does not have a standard physical QWERTY keyboard but instead has a virtual keyboard that it displays on the screen. This is becoming the norm anymore, though I personally prefer having a phone that has a physical fly-out keyboard. In use, the keyboard works fairly well though I have occasional issues with tapping the right keys as I have larger fingers which means that sometimes the phone registers the wrong button pressed. This is more the exception than the rule but it happens often enough to merit attention - if you have larger hands, be aware that typing can get a little frustrating if you're in a hurry.<br /><br />The greatest difficulty I have had with this phone is when using it with the car. I have a Ford Focus with full Sync system, and my Droid worked flawlessly with it. The Lumia works almost as well, though I have had the same problem many have had - when making an outbound call the system can shift into privacy mode and no one on either end hears anything. I have found that by using the phone to dial instead of using voice or the dashboard keypad the problem can be completely avoided but this is inconvenient. Recently my phone downloaded a large update and since then it seems to be working more consistently - time will tell if this has truly fixed the issue, but for now I have an acceptable workaround.<br /><br />Now, about Windows 8 on the phone... I am not a huge fan of Windows on the normal (non-touchscreen) computer, but on a touchscreen phone it seems like this is the way a phone should work. The Windows phone OS is very intuitive, easy to use and it just works. I love the tile-based screens. With my Droid I occasionally had issues where I somehow scrolled to a different screen and got icons messed up because of it; I have not had any issues of that kind with the Windows OS and so far am absolutely pleased. The one drawback I have with the platform is that once in a great while the phone will simply reboot without warning - never during a call (so far) but always unexpected. To be fair, I had the same problem with Android at about the same frequency, but it still needs to be mentioned.<br /><br />As at least one other reviewer mentioned, the number of apps in the online store is small compared to the quantity of apps in the Android or iPhone store. So far I have had no problem finding applications to suit my needs. There are more applications being added all the time but the problem is that the market share does not favor the Windows phone. The biggest targets are Android and iOS and that is where the majority of the applications are found right now.<br /><br />There is one application that I have been unable to find that I think is sorely needed - a reputable security suite. As I write this I have found none at all. I have looked at Norton and Kaspersky in particular for applications of this type and they do not support Windows 8 on the phone. To me, this is a big deal. There are partial solutions in the store but so far I have not found an antivirus or anything else that would be termed good mobile security. I do sincerely hope this is corrected soon. This is not a shortcoming of the phone itself; rather, it is a reflection of the Windows 8 mobile market share.<br /><br />The Lumia 822 is not without its quirks and issues but overall it is a very nice phone. It has a good feature set, it is easy to use and it's the right size for me. When it eventually dies, I will likely get something similar.",2013-05-17 11:24:20,1,False,elegant device quirk,moved lumia 822 window phone first generation droid several year happy droid worked well

4.0,Nice Quality,"I bought this phone case for a dear co-worker of mine. She has a Galaxy 3 Note and has been using the same phone case since she got the phone about 3 years ago. Her case has gotten very worn and is barely holding together. Because she has an older phone, there aren’t a lot of options for her as far as new phone cases go. She was practically in tears when I gave her this case. It fit her phone perfectly. She loved the magnetic feature which allowed her to easily remove her phone from the wallet. It’s made from PU leather, but it looks classy and like real leather. I have purchased some PU leather items that look more like vinyl, but this looks good. And I felt good giving it to her whereas if it had looked cheap, I probably wouldn’t have given it to her at all. The zipper on the wallet portion zipped okay. It wasn’t a super smooth gliding zipper. The case doesn’t interfere with the performance of the phone buttons or controls. My friend/co-worker is thrilled with this phone case and makes a point to show it to me almost daily and thank me.<br /><br />*I purchased this at a discounted price in exchange for my honest & unbiased review.

The cable is a bit short, but at least it's a fast-charging cable and base.<br /><br />- UV sanitizer<br />With the pandemic, being as clean as possible is highly important. Sanitizers obviously have become popular, and what gadget needs to be cleaned as frequently as the phone? The sanitizer hopefully works well. At least this device has an actual UV light; other sanitizers I've tried have just a blue- or purple-colored light.

5.0,Maybe the best looking case for iPhone,"This is easily the best looking case among the clear/mostly clear group of cases I’ve seen and/or tried.  It’s surprising how many ugly, clunky rubber phone cases exist and why anyone would spend $1000+ on a beautiful new device and then throw an ugly colored rubber case on it to make it look like a child’s toy.  If you want a case that offers some protection but also preserves the original look of your phone…THIS is it.  Anyway, the case looks just like the display image - shiny metallic edges/sides with a clear and VERY matte back to hide minor scratches and fingerprints.  The Apple logo is still easily visible, though.  Even though the sides are glossy and look like polished metal, they are made of hard rubber and are more grippy (unless your hands are oily) than they look.  I think the case would provide mild to moderate impact protection, but not as much as one of the big clunky rubber cases.  It’s not a big rugged case.  This case may be tagged as slim, but it is not the slimmest, either. There is a slimmer semi-hard clear plastic case available on Amazon (under various brand names) which is slimmer, but it scratches and cracks easily (I owned that case too) and just doesn’t look as good as this case does.  The edges of this case around the screen and camera are raised by a couple mm to provide some protection.  The back is thick enough that MagSafe accessories will not really stick to the phone, though. It can still charge wirelessly with this case on, but you will barely notice any pull from MagSafe accessories.  If you have a magnetic charging stand that is angled (maybe 45-60 degrees) your phone will NOT stick to it with this case on.  The case seems to be sealed well and doesn’t get moisture spots inside when in humid areas like the bathroom.  One amazing thing about this case is the precisely cut holes and button molds.  The cutouts for the charging port and the side mute switch are cut EXACTLY and evenly - not even a half mm off, so they are centered perfectly.  The cutouts also leave enough space around the charging port for a cable’s surrounding frame, and enough space that your finger can easily toggle the mute button.  The speaker holes are cut perfectly, too.  The button molds are raised just enough that you can feel them with your fingers (so you are not fumbling around trying to locate them) but do not protrude very much, allowing this case to slide easily in and out of your pockets.  I’m really amazed at how they got all of these little details right.  I would definitely recommend this case if you want a sleek, beautiful case that provides a bit of protection.  I wish they would make a MagSafe version of this case - possibly with rings painted to match the phone paint so they are nearly invisible.",2022-05-30 05:22:56,1,True,maybe best looking case iphone,easily best looking case among clearmostly clear group case ive seen andor tried surprising many ugly clunky rubber phone case exist anyone would spend 1000 beautiful new device throw ugly colored rubber case make look like child toy want case offer protection also preserve original look phonethis anyway case look like display image shiny metallic edgessides clear matte back hide minor scratch fingerprint apple logo still easily visible though even though side glossy look like polished metal made hard rubber grippy unless hand oily look think case would provide mild moderate impact protection much one big clunky rubber case big rugged case case may tagged slim slimmest either slimmer semihard clear plastic case available amazon various brand name slimmer scratch crack easily owned case doesnt look good case edge case around screen camera raised couple mm provide protection back thick enough magsafe accessory really stick phone though still charge wirelessly case barely notice pull magsafe accessory magnetic charging stand angled maybe 4560 degree phone stick case case seems sealed well doesnt get moisture spot inside humid area like bathroom one amazing thing case precisely cut hole button mold cutout charging port side mute switch cut exactly evenly even half mm centered perfectly cutout also leave enough space around charging port cable surrounding frame enough space finger easily toggle mute button speaker hole cut perfectly button mold raised enough feel finger fumbling around trying locate protrude much allowing case slide easily pocket im really amazed got little detail right would definitely recommend case want sleek beautiful case provides bit protection wish would make magsafe version case possibly ring painted match phone paint nearly invisible,maybe best looking case iphone easily best looking case among clearmostly clear group case ive seen andor tried surprising many ugly clunky rubber phone case exist anyone would spend 1000 beautiful new device throw ugly colored rubber case make look like child toy want case offer protection also preserve original look phonethis anyway case look like display image shiny metallic edgessides clear matte back hide minor scratch fingerprint apple logo still easily visible though even though side glossy look like polished metal made hard rubber grippy unless hand oily look think case would provide mild moderate impact protection much one big clunky rubber case big rugged case case may tagged slim slimmest either slimmer semihard clear plastic case available amazon various brand name slimmer scratch crack easily owned case doesnt look good case edge case around screen camera raised couple mm provide protection back thick enough magsafe accessory really stick phone though still charge wirelessly case barely notice pull magsafe accessory magnetic charging stand angled maybe 4560 degree phone stick case case seems sealed well doesnt get moisture spot inside humid area like bathroom one amazing thing case precisely cut hole button mold cutout charging port side mute switch cut exactly evenly even half mm centered perfectly cutout also leave enough space around charging port cable surrounding frame enough space finger easily toggle mute button speaker hole cut perfectly button mold raised enough feel finger fumbling around trying locate protrude much allowing case slide easily pocket im really amazed got little detail right would definitely recommend case want sleek beautiful case provides bit protection wish would make magsafe version case possibly ring painted match phone paint nearly invisible,positive,2022,Phone Case

I think my favorite thing about this armband is the zipped pocket where I can put my keys (my greatest fear is that I'll lose my keys while running).<br /><br />The one critique I have about this armband is that it is a universal armband for any phone (up to 6.9""), and not specifically just the iPhone Pro Max (6.7""). As a result, there is a little extra space around my Pro Max, but it is not so much that the phone moves around during my run.<br /><br />Overall, this is a good case at a good price.",2022-10-26 04:22:44,0,False,nice armband job,received armband squeezing iphone 14 pro max armband designed much smaller phone fortunately throw old armband away one great job holding large phone pocket id key think favorite thing armband zipped pocket put key greatest fear ill lose key runningbr br one critique armband universal armband phone 69 specifically iphone pro max 67 result little extra space around pro max much phone move around runbr br overall good case good price,nice armband job received armband squeezing iphone 14 pro max armband designed much smaller phone fortunately throw old armband away one great job holding large phone pocket id key think favorite thing armband zipped pocket put key greatest fear ill lose key runningbr br one critique armband universal armband phone 69 specifically iphone pro max 67 result little extra space around pro max much phone move around runbr br overall good case good price,positive,2022,Phone Holder

The only one it is a bit touchy on is my LG Notebook as I have to press harder on that screen. On the other three devices all stylus tips are extremely responsive.

Other than this, I love this better than a previous stylus I was using.<br /><br />On the interior of the cylinder is a ballpoint pen and a clear disk tip. On either end of the exterior, is a rubber tip and fiber mesh tip. One replacement tip for each of the four types is provided (see plastic bag in photos 1 & 2). Based on my tests, I do not feel one tip is better over the other. I was able to work with all of them. I personally prefer the rubber or fiber tips over the clear one but none have perfect precision (see last photo).

3.0,"Two words: ""good"" but ""overpriced""","This is an update AFTER I have purchased the honor 8 (with a heavy discount from manufacturer)<br /><br />Everything else is as most people have observed: quality build, smooth, ample memory ...<br /><br />However, one BIG complaint I have is the dual sim - Huawei's own manual (on model FRD-L04) says it CAN be used as dual-sim (or one sim and one sd card), numerous reviews said it support dual-sim, but it doesn't from what I can tell.<br /><br />why Huawei doesn't support more LTE bands, just like they do on Mate 9??<br /><br />Another issue is with dual camera - the wide aperture is a great misnomer, wide aperture on smart phone won't give you the bokeh effect, iphone's &#34;portrait&#34; mode is much easier on usability.<br /><br />---<br /><br />I bought Honor 5x as soon as it was out on Amazon: it was a good value proposition at the time. Not so for Honor 8.<br /><br />Honor 8 - I have hands-on experience, it is a step-up from Honor 5x, but not a $200 or double-priced step up.<br />Most folks who bought the Huawei phone are not because it is really better than iPhone at half the price (though I am sure Huawei wants you to think that way). Yes, it is beautifully designed, and I like 5.2 form factor more than 5.5. The dual camera is nice - but it is not pulling ahead of either iPhone or Samsung. All in all, a good step-up from Honor 5x released in US. That comes to my second point - it is an overpriced phone.<br /><br />The same phone or other similarly configured phone (from Xiaomi, Le2 etc) will cost about $50 to $100 less, which is significant in this price range. Huawei set this price simply because they can (and a bit greedy since this is US market). No other its fellow competitors from home  have released their phones in the US, yet. There maybe some pride on Huawei's part on about its reputation and quality that they think worth the extra.

1.0,Vent Clip Barely Fits Into 2003 Honda Civic’s Widest Vent Openings; Wireless Charging Is Convenient,"UPDATE 7/14/18:  Star rating downgraded from 4 stars to 1 star.  The wIreless charging pad is too flaky to rely upon.  After a week of use, my phone became reluctant to recognize the pad--or vice versa--and I had to reposition the phone, wiggle the cable, or plug and unplug the cable to get wireless charging to work at all.  The problem is with the charging pad, because the cable and &#34;cigarette lighter&#34; plug will charge my phone fast if the cable is plugged directly into the phone.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:  The vent clip clamps on this VENTEX WIRELESSPRO DOCK are almost too thick to fit into the widest vent openings (on the far left and right) in my 2003 Honda Civic.  The vent clip itself is very stiff to open, and barely opens wide enough to fit around the vent slats.  Once installed, the vent clip holds tightly and securely.<br /><br />The phone holder easily accepts my Samsung Galaxy S7+ (inside an Otterbox Symmetry case).  It’s nice to have a wireless charger on the dashboard, so that I don’t have to keep two phone cables in the car (one for a phone with a Micro AB port, and one for a phone with a Type C port).<br /><br />The wireless charger seems to work fine.  My Galaxy phone indicated right away that it was charging.  With a lock screen active display on, the charger added about 13% to the charge level during a 15-minute auto trip.<br /><br />With the power-draining Google Maps navigation display (with sound) turned on, the charger just barely maintained the existing charge level.  My phone was also quite hot afterwards--not uncommon with qi charging when a network connection is active, or with Google Maps live navigation generally--so in the future I’ll probably use the charging only when I’m NOT using Google Maps live navigation or am using it only briefly.<br /><br />The plug fits rather tightly into the DC power (“cigarette lighter”) receptacle on my Honda, but that’s okay. The cable is long enough to easily reach from the left side air vent to the receptacle, which is below the radio in the middle of the dashboard.",2018-07-07 19:43:52,2,False,vent clip barely fit 2003 honda civics widest vent opening wireless charging convenient,update 71418 star rating downgraded 4 star 1 star wireless charging pad flaky rely upon week use phone became reluctant recognize pador vice versaand reposition phone wiggle cable plug unplug cable get wireless charging work problem charging pad cable 34cigarette lighter34 plug charge phone fast cable plugged directly phonebr br original review vent clip clamp ventex wirelesspro dock almost thick fit widest vent opening far left right 2003 honda civic vent clip stiff open barely open wide enough fit around vent slat installed vent clip hold tightly securelybr br phone holder easily accepts samsung galaxy s7 inside otterbox symmetry case nice wireless charger dashboard dont keep two phone cable car one phone micro ab port one phone type c portbr br wireless charger seems work fine galaxy phone indicated right away charging lock screen active display charger added 13 charge level 15minute auto tripbr br powerdraining google map navigation display sound turned charger barely maintained existing charge level phone also quite hot afterwardsnot uncommon qi charging network connection active google map live navigation generallyso future ill probably use charging im using google map live navigation using brieflybr br plug fit rather tightly dc power cigarette lighter receptacle honda thats okay cable long enough easily reach left side air vent receptacle radio middle dashboard,vent clip barely fit 2003 honda civics widest vent opening wireless charging convenient update 71418 star rating downgraded 4 star 1 star wireless charging pad flaky rely upon week use phone became reluctant recognize pador vice versaand reposition phone wiggle cable plug unplug cable get wireless charging work problem charging pad cable 34cigarette lighter34 plug charge phone fast cable plugged directly phonebr br original review vent clip clamp ventex wirelesspro dock almost thick fit widest vent opening far left right 2003 honda civic vent clip stiff open barely open wide enough fit around vent slat installed vent clip hold tightly securelybr br phone holder easily accepts samsung galaxy s7 inside otterbox symmetry case nice wireless charger dashboard dont keep two phone cable car one phone micro ab port one phone type c portbr br wireless charger seems work fine galaxy phone indicated right away charging lock screen active display charger added 13 charge level 15minute auto tripbr br powerdraining google map navigation display sound turned charger barely maintained existing charge level phone also quite hot afterwardsnot uncommon qi charging network connection active google map live navigation generallyso future ill probably use charging im using google map live navigation using brieflybr br plug fit rather tightly dc power cigarette lighter receptacle honda thats okay cable long enough easily reach left side air vent receptacle radio middle dashboard,positive,2018,Phone Holder

5.0,Not just for iPhones,"I received this as a free review sample. To be honest, there are a number of these sets, mainly differentiated by brand name, available. This is as good as any I have used and actually better than some. If there is any difference, it's the clip and this one is more versatile than some I have used.<br /><br />First, while this is designed for the iPhone 5S it works with a lot of phones and tablets. I tested it with the iPhone, but also with a Galaxy Note 4, which is much larger, and it worked. The reason why I rated this so highly is the clip actually worked with the Note 4 while it was encased in an [[ASIN:B00NF4SXSO OtterBox Samsung Galaxy Note 4 Case Defender Series]]. That won me over.<br /><br />The fisheye and macro 15x lenses fit the clip. To use the wide angle lens it has to be piggy-backed off the macro lens.  The effects are undistorted (on the two phones with which I tested it), and the fisheye is a step above many I have used because it does not have the heavy circle that most such lenses impose on photos. The circle is there, but it's more subtle.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is a truly versatile kit. Yes, there are others that are close (and even identical) and I would rate all them - competitors included - the same five stars because they are an inexpensive way to add decent effects to a phone.",2016-01-20 16:50:54,0,False,iphones,received free review sample honest number set mainly differentiated brand name available good used actually better difference clip one versatile usedbr br first designed iphone 5 work lot phone tablet tested iphone also galaxy note 4 much larger worked reason rated highly clip actually worked note 4 encased asinb00nf4sxso otterbox samsung galaxy note 4 case defender series overbr br fisheye macro 15x lens fit clip use wide angle lens piggybacked macro lens effect undistorted two phone tested fisheye step many used heavy circle lens impose photo circle subtlebr br bottom line truly versatile kit yes others close even identical would rate competitor included five star inexpensive way add decent effect phone,iphones received free review sample honest number set mainly differentiated brand name available good used actually better difference clip one versatile usedbr br first designed iphone 5 work lot phone tablet tested iphone also galaxy note 4 much larger worked reason rated highly clip actually worked note 4 encased asinb00nf4sxso otterbox samsung galaxy note 4 case defender series overbr br fisheye macro 15x lens fit clip use wide angle lens piggybacked macro lens effect undistorted two phone tested fisheye step many used heavy circle lens impose photo circle subtlebr br bottom line truly versatile kit yes others close even identical would rate competitor included five star inexpensive way add decent effect phone,positive,2016,Phone Case

3.0,Going through them like they are candy,"This is the first time I've used glass protectors (used the thinner ones on my older phones for a decade).

First time my phone did fall from my pocket and hit the ground... not hard but enough to share the protector (not my phone, thankfully). The second time, it was just in my pocket... no idea how it got ""hit"" but it was shattered enough it was hurting my finger to get near it. On the plus side, my phone is fine, so they did their job. But at 1 a month, they are gonna get pricy. I'll be trying a few other brands and see if it's just glass or this brand in specific that seems really shatter-prone. They were also a bit fiesty to put on and I've not gotten them as lined up as I'd like over the front camera... close but no cigar. The back camera protector is going strong and I've got the two extra, so half a point for that small grace.

4.0,"Protector is solid strong, However…","This protector case is pretty solid and it seems it would definitely protect the Apple Watch Ultra. It’s thick and durable. What I do not like is that the touch screen protector that is part of it makes it difficult to touch the buttons.  For example: Passcode. You have to press down really hard and hold it down so the numbers will take. If you don’t hold it down, the number pressed will disappear.  It’s very annoying.<br /><br />Installation<br /><br />I followed the directions but it’s not that simple.  It states to insert crown side first and not to press down using the screen protector, to use the sides of it. That didn’t work for me. I continued to insert crown side first and slowly try to align the left side of the watch. It doesn’t go on easily.  I had to use the tip of my finger and carefully lift the left side of protector away from watch and use my other hand to press down. That popped on really fast.  It scared me with the actual screen. No damage, thank god.<br /><br />In summary, the protector is very strong and durable. I do not like the difficulty of trying to press buttons.

4.0,Terrific Protective Case for Fairly Weighty Phone,"This OTTERBOX DEFENDER SERIES CASE FOR GALAXY S8+ (Screen Protector Not Included; Cowabunga Blue/Gunmetal Grey) is a terrific protective case for a fairly weighty, curved-screen phone.  It consists of a two-piece plastic inner case that cradles the phone, and a rubber slipcover for the inner case that surrounds the phone with a thick bumper.  There is no screen protector (found on many Defender series cases for other phones), because of the S8+’s curved touchscreen.<br /><br />The only negative feature of this protective case is that the rubber slipcover interferes with wireless charging.  However, wireless charging works normally with the slipcover off, and the slipcover is easy to remove and replace.<br /><br />A separate hard plastic piece fits over the display, covering it completely.  This piece has a belt clip that holds the phone firmly.  I like this, as my strong preference is for belt-clip or holster cases.<br /><br />The belt clip can be held open by a small tab, so that the clip functions as a mini stand (for viewing the display in landscape position only).  It’s hard to engage the hold-open tab, and the “stand” is not adjustable, so this feature is not a reason to buy the case.<br /><br />The rubber slipcover is grey.  The inner plastic case is an unusual shade of bright blue (almost teal).  The plastic cover piece with the belt clip is black.<br /><br />NOTE:  All protective cases for the curved touchscreens (Galaxy S7 Edge, S8, S8+) leave the curved portion of the display unprotected at the sides (showing slightly above the edge of the case).  This is necessary to provide full functionality for the curved portions of the touchscreen.  If you drop a curved-screen phone face down when the touchscreen is uncovered, you may crack the screen, no matter what case you’re using.  When the belt-clip piece of this case is used, the display is fully covered and reasonably well protected.",2017-10-18 05:11:52,0,False,terrific protective case fairly weighty phone,otterbox defender series case galaxy s8 screen protector included cowabunga bluegunmetal grey terrific protective case fairly weighty curvedscreen phone consists twopiece plastic inner case cradle phone rubber slipcover inner case surround phone thick bumper screen protector found many defender series case phone s8s curved touchscreenbr br negative feature protective case rubber slipcover interferes wireless charging however wireless charging work normally slipcover slipcover easy remove replacebr br separate hard plastic piece fit display covering completely piece belt clip hold phone firmly like strong preference beltclip holster casesbr br belt clip held open small tab clip function mini stand viewing display landscape position hard engage holdopen tab stand adjustable feature reason buy casebr br rubber slipcover grey inner plastic case unusual shade bright blue almost teal plastic cover piece belt clip blackbr br note protective case curved touchscreen galaxy s7 edge s8 s8 leave curved portion display unprotected side showing slightly edge case necessary provide full functionality curved portion touchscreen drop curvedscreen phone face touchscreen uncovered may crack screen matter case youre using beltclip piece case used display fully covered reasonably well protected,terrific protective case fairly weighty phone otterbox defender series case galaxy s8 screen protector included cowabunga bluegunmetal grey terrific protective case fairly weighty curvedscreen phone consists twopiece plastic inner case cradle phone rubber slipcover inner case surround phone thick bumper screen protector found many defender series case phone s8s curved touchscreenbr br negative feature protective case rubber slipcover interferes wireless charging however wireless charging work normally slipcover slipcover easy remove replacebr br separate hard plastic piece fit display covering completely piece belt clip hold phone firmly like strong preference beltclip holster casesbr br belt clip held open small tab clip function mini stand viewing display landscape position hard engage holdopen tab stand adjustable feature reason buy casebr br rubber slipcover grey inner plastic case unusual shade bright blue almost teal plastic cover piece belt clip blackbr br note protective case curved touchscreen galaxy s7 edge s8 s8 leave curved portion display unprotected side showing slightly edge case necessary provide full functionality curved portion touchscreen drop curvedscreen phone face touchscreen uncovered may crack screen matter case youre using beltclip piece case used display fully covered reasonably well protected,positive,2017,Screen Protector

3.0,I Can't Get This to Work; Am I Doing Something Wrong? UPDATED,"My original review of this is below. I received a stylus that did not work. I contacted Vine about this and they sent me a new one immediately. Thank you, Vine personnel!<br /><br />The reason I wanted to try this one is that most styluses are so clumsily tipped! They just have a big soft nub of rubber and when you are working on a small screen as on a 7-inch tablet or a phone it will pick two letters or two numbers at the time on a virtual keyboard. I have gone crazy looking for something with a tinier stylus tip and this looked good. I thought if this worked out I would buy another for my husband, who is constantly complaining that his stylus tip is too large.<br /><br />In general I like this. I charged it overnight, then unplugged, turned it on and it worked without me needing to twist the tip to adjust the signal. It works on my Samsung Galaxy Tab 4, both 7"" and 10"" versions, and also on my Pixel phone (and that is such a temperamental little twit that a lot of things don't work with it). Sadly, the stylus doesn't seem to work as well on my touch-screen Acer Windows laptop, but I have only tried it in one program that was not made for use with a pen. It might work on another app better.<br /><br />I've only been using it to read magazines and do some cleanup work on files on my tablet, so I haven't explored it totally. I tried downloading a drawing program on the 10"" tablet, but the pen didn't work that well, but the app wasn't rated that well, either, and it didn't work that well with my normal stylus, either. I did find if I used it while I was reading and didn't turn pages fast enough, it goes into standby mode and then I wonder why it's not working until I realize the light is not on. I need to test it further on something like an app that lets you use handwriting input.<br /><br />What I really, really dislike about this stylus is that there is no way to fasten it to ANYTHING. It has no clip so you can clip it to your pocket or to your tablet case, or a ring so you can put a ""leash"" on it. It's not even magnetic. If I gave one to my husband he would promptly lose it! What's with the no clip or no method of keeping it leashed??? Even a cheap Bic pen has a clip!<br /><br />====================================================<br /><br />I charged this via a USB plug. I noticed immediately that the charging cord plug does not go all the way into the stylus; there is still a sixteenth of an inch of the charging cord plug showing. It went from red to blue and charged all night. But when I took it off the charger and pressed the button to turn it on, there was no light. I take it a light is supposed to come on when you press the button and will stay on until the battery runs down and it will turn red. I get no light at all.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to this. Did I do something wrong? Was overnight (12 hours) too short to charge it? Is it because the mini-USB plug does not go all the way in the pen? I have tried all ways pressing the button.<br /><br />Is there any way to get one that WORKS????",2018-12-11 19:10:28,0,False,cant get work something wrong updated,original review received stylus work contacted vine sent new one immediately thank vine personnelbr br reason wanted try one stylus clumsily tipped big soft nub rubber working small screen 7inch tablet phone pick two letter two number time virtual keyboard gone crazy looking something tinier stylus tip looked good thought worked would buy another husband constantly complaining stylus tip largebr br general like charged overnight unplugged turned worked without needing twist tip adjust signal work samsung galaxy tab 4 7 10 version also pixel phone temperamental little twit lot thing dont work sadly stylus doesnt seem work well touchscreen acer window laptop tried one program made use pen might work another app betterbr br ive using read magazine cleanup work file tablet havent explored totally tried downloading drawing program 10 tablet pen didnt work well app wasnt rated well either didnt work well normal stylus either find used reading didnt turn page fast enough go standby mode wonder working realize light need test something like app let use handwriting inputbr br really really dislike stylus way fasten anything clip clip pocket tablet case ring put leash even magnetic gave one husband would promptly lose whats clip method keeping leashed even cheap bic pen clipbr br br br charged via usb plug noticed immediately charging cord plug go way stylus still sixteenth inch charging cord plug showing went red blue charged night took charger pressed button turn light take light supposed come press button stay battery run turn red get light allbr br really looking forward something wrong overnight 12 hour short charge miniusb plug go way pen tried way pressing buttonbr br way get one work,cant get work something wrong updated original review received stylus work contacted vine sent new one immediately thank vine personnelbr br reason wanted try one stylus clumsily tipped big soft nub rubber working small screen 7inch tablet phone pick two letter two number time virtual keyboard gone crazy looking something tinier stylus tip looked good thought worked would buy another husband constantly complaining stylus tip largebr br general like charged overnight unplugged turned worked without needing twist tip adjust signal work samsung galaxy tab 4 7 10 version also pixel phone temperamental little twit lot thing dont work sadly stylus doesnt seem work well touchscreen acer window laptop tried one program made use pen might work another app betterbr br ive using read magazine cleanup work file tablet havent explored totally tried downloading drawing program 10 tablet pen didnt work well app wasnt rated well either didnt work well normal stylus either find used reading didnt turn page fast enough go standby mode wonder working realize light need test something like app let use handwriting inputbr br really really dislike stylus way fasten anything clip clip pocket tablet case ring put leash even magnetic gave one husband would promptly lose whats clip method keeping leashed even cheap bic pen clipbr br br br charged via usb plug noticed immediately charging cord plug go way stylus still sixteenth inch charging cord plug showing went red blue charged night took charger pressed button turn light take light supposed come press button stay battery run turn red get light allbr br really looking forward something wrong overnight 12 hour short charge miniusb plug go way pen tried way pressing buttonbr br way get one work,positive,2018,Phone Case

In my panicked reflex I instantly flung the phone away from me like a frisbee for some crazy stupid reason (something I've never done, even with other bugs flying into my screen in the past), sending it spinning from my hand into the concrete six or so feet away from me.  My heart sank.  What have I done?  And yet, not a scratch on it, not a single blemish. Even the case still looks perfect.<br /><br />That alone, to me, is worth the price.

It was great at first, but over time, the case has yellowed and it has actually become warped (to the point where my phone will come out of it if I pick it up the wrong way).<br /><br />Other than the durability, the kickstand is quite useful and sturdy. My only critique on the kickstand is that when using the kickstand to prop your phone horizontally, the volume buttons are on the bottom (meaning you have to pick up the phone to change the volume). It would have been better if the kickstand was oriented the other way so that the volume buttons would be on the top when the phone is horizontal. The kickstand issue is quite minor and doesn't affect my use of the case in a major way.<br /><br />Other than those two issues, I think it is a good case.

5.0,Five stars for value,"For basic protection and good looks this case is hard to beat. There are a few small details that were either overlooked or considered 'good enough' by the manufacturer, which I'll get into, but then this case cost less than five bucks shipped.<br /><br />I've uploaded six customer-supplied photos to visually highlight the strong and weak points.<br /><br />The strongest factor is the material and the way it has been cut and assembled afford excellent protection for your phone. The wallet and card slots are very nice touches that add functionality to the case.<br /><br />Plus it's simply beautiful. A case in point: I purchased this phone for a friend and took her to dinner. The server saw and fell in love with the case. She had paid over twenty dollars for her case, which did not have the wallet, credit card and ID slots, or the cover to completely protect her phone. When she found out the cost of this one she wrote down the particulars and vowed to order one for herself.<br /><br />There are a few minor issues with the case that need to be disclosed. First, the fit and cut-outs are not precise. The part that holds the phone in place is a little loose and imperfectly measured. This causes the phone to slide a little to the left in the holder, which makes accessing keys on the left side of the screen keyboard difficult. You can still use the keyboard, but with some difficulty. See one of the photos that I uploaded for a visual.<br /><br />Two other very minor issues are: (1) imprecise way the cut-out is aligned to the camera lens (this is more of a aesthetic defect because it does not hamper taking photos). (2) a loose stitch right at flap that can easily be trimmed. Both are documented in the photos I've uploaded.<br /><br />Minor issues notwithstanding, this case is a bargain, and an eye-catching one at that. I personally feel that you cannot go wrong with it.",2013-02-15 12:11:39,70,True,five star value,basic protection good look case hard beat small detail either overlooked considered good enough manufacturer ill get case cost less five buck shippedbr br ive uploaded six customersupplied photo visually highlight strong weak pointsbr br strongest factor material way cut assembled afford excellent protection phone wallet card slot nice touch add functionality casebr br plus simply beautiful case point purchased phone friend took dinner server saw fell love case paid twenty dollar case wallet credit card id slot cover completely protect phone found cost one wrote particular vowed order one herselfbr br minor issue case need disclosed first fit cutout precise part hold phone place little loose imperfectly measured cause phone slide little left holder make accessing key left side screen keyboard difficult still use keyboard difficulty see one photo uploaded visualbr br two minor issue 1 imprecise way cutout aligned camera lens aesthetic defect hamper taking photo 2 loose stitch right flap easily trimmed documented photo ive uploadedbr br minor issue notwithstanding case bargain eyecatching one personally feel go wrong,five star value basic protection good look case hard beat small detail either overlooked considered good enough manufacturer ill get case cost less five buck shippedbr br ive uploaded six customersupplied photo visually highlight strong weak pointsbr br strongest factor material way cut assembled afford excellent protection phone wallet card slot nice touch add functionality casebr br plus simply beautiful case point purchased phone friend took dinner server saw fell love case paid twenty dollar case wallet credit card id slot cover completely protect phone found cost one wrote particular vowed order one herselfbr br minor issue case need disclosed first fit cutout precise part hold phone place little loose imperfectly measured cause phone slide little left holder make accessing key left side screen keyboard difficult still use keyboard difficulty see one photo uploaded visualbr br two minor issue 1 imprecise way cutout aligned camera lens aesthetic defect hamper taking photo 2 loose stitch right flap easily trimmed documented photo ive uploadedbr br minor issue notwithstanding case bargain eyecatching one personally feel go wrong,positive,2013,Phone Case
4.0,Improves 3G Coverage Adequately Over a Small Area,"The cell signal in our house is good everywhere except in the basement, which is partially finished. I have put together a home office down there so I spend a good deal of time in the basement and when I receive a call it gets a little spotty due to the reduced reception. When I do get a data connection it is often 1X and unreliable. Connecting to the WiFi network resolves the data issue but it does not help the call quality nor does it reduce dropped calls. I looked to this booster kit to help improve the connectivity and reception in the basement and it does work; however, it requires some planning when setting up and it may not be the right fit for your configuration depending on the coverage you need.<br /><br />First, it is important to understand that this is a 3G booster and has limited use with current 4G/LTE phones. If you have a 4G phone, you are better off with the 4G version so you can get the benefit of the 4G speed boost, not just call quality improvements.<br /><br />The unit consists of an indoor box that handles processing, an indoor antenna and an outdoor antenna. This requires some planning and coordination. The two antennas require some distance apart to work properly or they interfere with one another a little, so planning ahead is going to help the install go smoother. The higher up you can place the outdoor antenna the better. Because I wanted the unit in the basement and I wanted the best possible signal, this meant mounting the outdoor antenna at a much higher point on the house. The indoor antenna is a directional one and it requires a little planning as well – don’t point at the outdoor antenna and decide where you want to place this antenna to maximize the coverage in the room.<br /><br />Double-paned windows are not your friend when it comes to this unit. The glass interferes with the signal and prevents the unit from really working properly.<br /><br />Once everything was all connected and the unit configured properly, I went to the furthest area of the basement where the signal is typically weakest and almost always fails over to 1X. I turned off the WiFi and let the phone figure out what to do. After a short time, it picked up the 3G signal and was usable. It wasn’t a particularly strong signal but it was enough to make stable phone calls with good quality and no drops so far. This particular unit is designed for small area coverage like a room or two, so if you need full house coverage consider one of the other units that offers a stronger signal and better range.<br /><br />For boosting 3G coverage over a small area (a room or two), this unit seems to work fairly well. Installation requires some pre-planning, and the signal strength is not super-strong, but it’s good for correcting holes in coverage in a home.",2015-02-19 17:15:37,1,False,improves 3g coverage adequately small area,cell signal house good everywhere except basement partially finished put together home office spend good deal time basement receive call get little spotty due reduced reception get data connection often 1x unreliable connecting wifi network resolve data issue help call quality reduce dropped call looked booster kit help improve connectivity reception basement work however requires planning setting may right fit configuration depending coverage needbr br first important understand 3g booster limited use current 4glte phone 4g phone better 4g version get benefit 4g speed boost call quality improvementsbr br unit consists indoor box handle processing indoor antenna outdoor antenna requires planning coordination two antenna require distance apart work properly interfere one another little planning ahead going help install go smoother higher place outdoor antenna better wanted unit basement wanted best possible signal meant mounting outdoor antenna much higher point house indoor antenna directional one requires little planning well dont point outdoor antenna decide want place antenna maximize coverage roombr br doublepaned window friend come unit glass interferes signal prevents unit really working properlybr br everything connected unit configured properly went furthest area basement signal typically weakest almost always fails 1x turned wifi let phone figure short time picked 3g signal usable wasnt particularly strong signal enough make stable phone call good quality drop far particular unit designed small area coverage like room two need full house coverage consider one unit offer stronger signal better rangebr br boosting 3g coverage small area room two unit seems work fairly well installation requires preplanning signal strength superstrong good correcting hole coverage home,improves 3g coverage adequately small area cell signal house good everywhere except basement partially finished put together home office spend good deal time basement receive call get little spotty due reduced reception get data connection often 1x unreliable connecting wifi network resolve data issue help call quality reduce dropped call looked booster kit help improve connectivity reception basement work however requires planning setting may right fit configuration depending coverage needbr br first important understand 3g booster limited use current 4glte phone 4g phone better 4g version get benefit 4g speed boost call quality improvementsbr br unit consists indoor box handle processing indoor antenna outdoor antenna requires planning coordination two antenna require distance apart work properly interfere one another little planning ahead going help install go smoother higher place outdoor antenna better wanted unit basement wanted best possible signal meant mounting outdoor antenna much higher point house indoor antenna directional one requires little planning well dont point outdoor antenna decide want place antenna maximize coverage roombr br doublepaned window friend come unit glass interferes signal prevents unit really working properlybr br everything connected unit configured properly went furthest area basement signal typically weakest almost always fails 1x turned wifi let phone figure short time picked 3g signal usable wasnt particularly strong signal enough make stable phone call good quality drop far particular unit designed small area coverage like room two need full house coverage consider one unit offer stronger signal better rangebr br boosting 3g coverage small area room two unit seems work fairly well installation requires preplanning signal strength superstrong good correcting hole coverage home,positive,2015,Phone Holder

2.0,This seemed like a “hot” idea.,"The Wuloo Charging Stand seemed like a great idea when I ordered it, but in actuality, it isn’t. First, while assembling the charging stand is pretty simple (you just screw in the parts), it is somewhat inconvenient. So beware, this equipment requires some assembly on the part of the purchaser. Once that is completed, it looks really cool but there are some basic things that I would change. It does not come with a charging brick (portion that goes into the wall), so if you expect this stand to come with everything you need it doesn’t. You will have to locate one which seems to defeat the purpose. If you purchased this device to replace a lost or broken one, you’ll still need to order the brick separately. And to charge it, you must be plugged into a USB. I also notice that the wire or charging cord does not stay in the charger very well. And while none of these things by themselves is a big deal, in the totality of things it makes this product less attractive. And just so you don’t think that I have anything positive to say about this product, I do like that it looks cool and is affordable. I just wished it worked as well as I hoped.",2018-11-20 21:04:39,0,False,seemed like hot idea,wuloo charging stand seemed like great idea ordered actuality isnt first assembling charging stand pretty simple screw part somewhat inconvenient beware equipment requires assembly part purchaser completed look really cool basic thing would change come charging brick portion go wall expect stand come everything need doesnt locate one seems defeat purpose purchased device replace lost broken one youll still need order brick separately charge must plugged usb also notice wire charging cord stay charger well none thing big deal totality thing make product less attractive dont think anything positive say product like look cool affordable wished worked well hoped,seemed like hot idea wuloo charging stand seemed like great idea ordered actuality isnt first assembling charging stand pretty simple screw part somewhat inconvenient beware equipment requires assembly part purchaser completed look really cool basic thing would change come charging brick portion go wall expect stand come everything need doesnt locate one seems defeat purpose purchased device replace lost broken one youll still need order brick separately charge must plugged usb also notice wire charging cord stay charger well none thing big deal totality thing make product less attractive dont think anything positive say product like look cool affordable wished worked well hoped,positive,2018,Phone Charger

5.0,Tempered Glass Privacy Screen - Works Great,"Most people think of screen protection for a mobile phone as a glass or plastic cover that prevents the actual screen from shattering. That’s true, this is the most important aspect of screen protection. But, what about protecting the data displayed on the screen? I have seen privacy screens for laptop screens, but this is the first I have used with a mobile phone and it works exactly like the laptop screen protectors.<br /><br />Similar to a regular screen protector, this is a thin sheet of glass that applies very smoothly and easily with no bubbles. It has fine screen coverage to the edge of the phone - this has been an issue on some other screen protectors I have used but not this one.<br /><br />With this screen protector in place, the screen is definitely darker than usual and it might be helpful to adjust the screen brightness. It is a lot like looking at your screen through a pair of sunglasses. Turning the phone at a 45-degree angle makes the screen appear completely black as if the screen has been turned off - no light can be seen at all.<br /><br />Before I put this protector on the phone I held it up to a light source and saw a repeating pattern of the light source itself, almost like I had held up a mirror to a mirror to get a replicated image. I think this protector works via polarized light and the repeating image is an effect of that - I have seen similar phenomena when wearing polarizing sunglasses.<br /><br />If protecting the data on your phone screen is as important to you as protecting the screen itself, this is the screen protector you need. It works great, is easy to apply and is sufficient protection for you phone’s screen to prevent physical damage. Just make sure you have the right one for your model of phone.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Fast and light charger,"Son bought this for an upcoming backpacking trip where he plans to use phone to play music, etc for entertainment.  Will couple this will a battery pack.  I didn't believe him hen he said it charged his phone in less than an hour. I plugged my phone in at 27% and within 45 minutes it was already at 60% reported charge (Samsung Galaxy S5 active (2800 mAh).  Of course I know that will drop a bit once it's taken off the charger but I think this will work perfectly for his trip. As other reviewers have mentioned the pocket is useless for anything other than the included cable.  What I found to work best was used that flap to make a tent of sort of one of the solar panels and place the phone under there in the shade so the battery wouldn't get too hot from sitting in the sun.  this worked great in that configuration. It will also work good to strap it to top of his backpack and get a longer cable to place battery pack inside the top pocket of his pack to be able to take advantage of the sunny spots on the trail.

5.0,"No wifi, no bluetooth, no special apps needed, this tech is unbelievable...","THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* Great build quality. Good heft to it.<br />* Aesthetically, looks great with what looks like a gunmetal finish.<br />* USB-C for charging is always a plus.<br />* Nice, high quality carrying case included.<br />* This device does not need any special apps, does not need to be connected to any wifi, does not need to be connected to your phone by bluetooth or whatever. It is simply A.I. witchcraft and it just works. I have no clue how or why it works, it just does.<br />* Some of these holders can make a motor noise that you cannot hear, but your camera may record it, and you'll hear it when you replay your video. I've seen people say they get motor noise with this exact model. However, that hasn't been my experience at all. I don't know if the phone you use has anything to do with it, but I use a Google Pixel 6 Pro, and I don't get any motor noise in my videos. This thing has been perfect.<br /><br />HOW TO OPERATE:<br />-----------------------<br />* Charge it, or keep it connected to a power source and use immediately.<br />* Place your phone on it.<br />* Secure it with the onboard tightening knob.<br />* Hold power button for 3 seconds. It will blink red. Now if you skip the manual, this is where you get confused because it simply shuts itself off. I admit, I didn't read the manual. LOL! Anyway, after turning it on and seeing it blink red, you need to face the camera and make an OK sign with your fingers. The led turns green and it starts tracking you. Again, no wifi, no bluetooth, just an OK sign with your fingers. LOL! Simply amazing.<br />* To pause the tracking, Give it an ""OPEN PALM"" sign like you're about to give it a high five.

5.0,"Requires a lighter, bumper stype case or direct application to back of phone","I received this as a free review sample eleven months ago. I keep it in my gig bag for then I am a front seat passenger in friends' vehicles. As such it has been used in a large number of vehicles and has worked in all of them with respect to mounting on vents.<br /><br />There are a few things you need to take into consideration. First, this does not work well with folio type cases that are leather (real or faux), or heavier cases. The best case is a bumper style. Or you can affix the metal piece (choice of round or oblong) directly to the back of your phone.<br /><br />This is capable of supporting a Note 4, which brings me to another consideration: the magnet will interfere with an S-pen on any of the Samsung Note series if you remove the pen and attempt to use it while mounted. If you do not remove the pen there is no problem.<br /><br />Finally, this works best during the summer months. My phones love air conditioning, but not heat. So, I would not recommend this during cold spells when you have your heater turned up.<br /><br />Bottom line: this is handy as a permanent or temporary mount.

2.0,Does Not Work Well,"Sadly, this does not work as shown. Don't get me wrong the quality of the product is excellent. I was looking for an alternative to the Otterbox and wallet (men wallet) and thought this is it. It has four slots. One for the DL and three cards. You could probably slide some bills in the slot under the cards on the left side but it will be a pain each time you do it. The problem is that with a DL and three bank cards the wallet has a bulge when you close it and the magnetic closure will not grip and keep it secure. The other problem is that with four cards in this case and you close it it will turn on your cell. I had to change mine to a 15 second screen lock so it would not do that. But, in the end it will have to go back. Sadly, a simple design change of increasing the back binder spacing by twice the width would allow this case to close easily with the cards and cell.",2014-08-09 16:05:48,0,True,work well,sadly work shown dont get wrong quality product excellent looking alternative otterbox wallet men wallet thought four slot one dl three card could probably slide bill slot card left side pain time problem dl three bank card wallet bulge close magnetic closure grip keep secure problem four card case close turn cell change mine 15 second screen lock would end go back sadly simple design change increasing back binder spacing twice width would allow case close easily card cell,work well sadly work shown dont get wrong quality product excellent looking alternative otterbox wallet men wallet thought four slot one dl three card could probably slide bill slot card left side pain time problem dl three bank card wallet bulge close magnetic closure grip keep secure problem four card case close turn cell change mine 15 second screen lock would end go back sadly simple design change increasing back binder spacing twice width would allow case close easily card cell,positive,2014,Screen Protector

3.0,Great with few problems,"The installation was not that hard just follow directions EXACTLY! If I were to do it all over again, I would spray more than my finger tips OR I would spray the screen protector holding it in the air and not resting it in the palm of my hand. I may also not go so crazy with the water, think it was a little too wet and made the installation messy and caused me to have a lot of bubbles.<br /><br />GIVE IT TIME AND BE PATIENT! The bubbles, scratches, imperfections will go away after 12 hours! It is crystal clear and makes the screen look great. However there are slight ridges on the screen when held up against the light (with the screen off), which I think is normal, but I wish it looked a little smoother.<br /><br />DOWNSIDE: When I took it out of the box, it had 2 particles stuck to it by the speaker cut-out. They are still there can I cant get them off, hopefully hasn't scratched my screen. I contacted them for a replacement and they were very helpful.<br /><br />I used to have the Zagg invisible shield on a previous phone and they actually look/feel identical, in my opinion.<br /><br />UPDATE 10/2011 - I tried to get a replacement and it costs $4.95 for ""shipping and handling.

5.0,Finally found my case!,"My husband and I both have a Droid Razr Maxx. His was purchased October 2, 2012 and mine was purchased March 21, 2013.<br /><br />We originally purchased two [[ASIN:B006WC0U4G Otterbox Commuter Case for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]] as I had an Otterbox on my previous phone (a Droid Incredible 2) and loved it. The silicone flaps covering the access ports on the Otterbox Razr Maxx cases were nothing short of a disappointment. They never seated correctly and were always coming loose and flapping around allowing dust and particles into the ports. One of the reasons for purchasing the Otterbox cases was because it had these port covers. Since those failed to perform correctly these cases were removed from our phones and they have been naked and without protection for about a week now.<br /><br />After extensive research of countless cases and reviews here on Amazon, I purchased this case along with three others in a desperate attempt to find the right case for our Droid Razr Maxx phones, once and for all. The cases purchased and compared were:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00829HLZS Asmyna MOTXT912MHPCSO006NP Premium Durable Protective Case for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX XT912 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0077IQA2K Trident Case AG-XT912-BK AEGIS Case for Motorola Droid Razr MAXX (XT912) - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007KZQNP4 Seidio BD2-HR3MTRM-BK SURFACE Case and Holster Combo for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007PPYXME Seidio BD2-HK3MTRMK-BK ACTIVE Combo with Metal Kickstand for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />First, the Asmyna:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-It is easy to 'install'.<br />-The front and back pieces audibly snap together and seems to hold firm.<br />-It feels good in the hand, being somewhat slick and glossy.<br />-Does not add bulk to an already sizable phone.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-It does not line up properly with the camera, flash, speaker or noise-cancelling speaker on the back of the phone.<br />-It is too slick, causing it to slide off of just about any surface.<br />-It is extremely prone to fingerprints.<br />-All ports are openly exposed to the elements (dust and particle collection, moisture, etc.)<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I would not recommend this case as, for me, its cons outweigh its pros. I also cannot attest to this product's ability to protect a phone from a drop as I did not feel confident that it would stay on the phone upon any kind of impact. So I chose not to submit my $600 phone to what I deemed an imminent death. This case will be returned.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Next, the Trident Aegis:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Sturdy, two part design.<br />-Everything lined up beautifully on my Razr Maxx.<br />-Install was a breeze, with only a little encouraging to get the inner silicone liner to set inside the lip of the outer hard shell casing.<br />-The outer hard shell has two built-in mesh-like dust covers that go over the rear speaker and the noise-cancelling speaker when installed on the phone.<br />-The design on the back of the inside silicone liner pokes through the back of the outer hard shell and slightly raises the phone off any surface it is laying on, thus making the speaker sound un-muffled. This is a difficult feature to find in cases these days (why manufacturers don't just place the speaker on the front of the phone for this very reason, is beyond me).<br />-All ports are covered by silicone flaps.<br />-Accessibility to the MicroSD and Sim cards without case removal.<br />-Power and volume buttons are covered and operate as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-When laying face down, the outer rim of the case provides protection to the touch screen by slightly raising it off of any surface it is placed on.<br />-Adds bulk, but not as much as the Otterbox Commuter case.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-There are two locations (along the edge of the MicroSD and Sim card protection flap and along the front, top, center of the phone - directly above 'Motorola') on the silicone liner where the silicone is in extremely thin strips. I do not see these holding up very long as I can see these ripping or tearing after sufficient use.<br />-The protective flaps are flimsy and do not set into place very well (with the exception of the headphone jack cover, which seats almost too well).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />Even though I have listed more pros than cons, I will not be keeping this case. To me, a cell phone case should be something that you can easily install (and remove if necessary) and not be something that you have to continuously battle to stay in place on your phone. Although it is not a deal breaker for me if a phone has protective flaps over access ports or not - it does matter to me that if a case does have these that they set in place properly and not flap around freely. I also am fearful of the longevity of this case given the thinness of the inner silicone liner. For these reasons, I believe I will be returning this Trident Aegis case.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Next, the Seidio Surface (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Lined up well with the camera, flash, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and all buttons.<br />-Does not add any noticeable bulk.<br />-Exterior surface is has a soft-to-the-touch feeling while remaining hard.<br />-Includes a holster.<br />-MicroSD/Sim card access door area of the case is solid. (This may be a con to others, but I prefer this be solid as I rarely ever need to access my SD or Sim cards.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-No silicone components making it very slick.<br />-Easy to put on the phone, but be prepared for an all out battle to remove it. I spent close to fifteen minutes fighting this thing, trying to coerce it off of my phone. Due to its lack of any silicone, I could not get a good grip on the case and had to turn my phone off as I kept pressing the power and volume buttons in my all out brawl.<br />-All ports are exposed (except the MicroSD and Sim card access door, see Pros list above).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />This case is laughable. It is the only case in my many years of cell phone ownership to cause me so much frustration upon trying to remove it from my phone. The scenario I found myself in while trying to remove the case was very similar to trying to get out of a Chinese finger trap - pretty much every movement makes things worse. I prefer a case to fit snugly, as those offer the best protection because they will not slip or slide on the phone. But this Seidio Surface case, wow.. needless to say, despite the pros I listed for it, this case will be returned.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />And, finally, the Seidio Active (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Does not add much bulk (as compared to the Otterbox Commuter)<br />-Well thought out and functional two part design<br />-Feels good in the hand<br />-Easy to operate while holding in one hand (not too heavy)<br />-Silicone along the edges makes is very easy to grip and keep your grip. This case will rarely slip from your grasp.<br />-All ports and the camera, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and buttons line up perfectly.<br />-Power and volume buttons respond with the same (if not better!) sensitivity as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-The MicroSD and Sim card access door is completely blocked (again, I know some others may prefer to have access to this door, but this is a preference of mine as I hardly ever need to remove/replace these cards).<br />-The kickstand is a fun addition - is functional and seems as though it would last quite awhile as long as you were gentle when pulling it from its seated magnetic position.<br />-Includes a belt holster which fits the phone w/case perfectly.<br />-The phone w/case can be seated in the included holster either facing in or out.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The addition of the kickstand on the back causes the phone to tilt toward the top - this muffles the rear speaker.<br />-With so much silicone exposed on the sides of the phone, I can see the potential for these areas being dust magnets.<br />-The top ports (HDMI, Power and headphone jack) are left openly exposed. Although this is not a deal breaker for me, it may be for others. (NOTE: Because the phone can be inserted into the holster either faced in or out, the holster's clip partially covers the top ports, offering some protection. Not much, but thought I would mention it.)<br />-The retention clip on the holster appears to have a disadvantage because of its design - due to the curve and the distance the clip extends from the phone, I can see this potentially catching on things (seat belts, couches, chairs, etc.) and either breaking the clip entirely, rendering the holster useless and requiring a replacement be purchased OR dislodging the phone from the holster allowing it to fall to the ground.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I believe I finally found the case I have been searching for - the Seidio Active. My husband also chose this case of the four we received and I have reviewed here. So, I guess that means I need to purchase another one for myself. The black is exactly what my husband wanted, but I prefer a color that stands out more.. so I suppose I will be buying the red or blue. Once I receive that case, I will update my review to report on the clarity of the color as opposed to the color depicted here online.<br /><br />Thank you for reading. I hope my search helps someone else find the perfect case for them too (as well as saving them the time of conducting the research!).",2013-07-13 00:27:06,4,True,finally found case,husband droid razr

2.0,Doesn't Stay Adhered or Recognize Fingerprint or Typing,"UPDATE:  I lowered my rating because the screen protector doesn't even stay adhered to the screen and doesn't even register what you type on the screen (repeats letters you're typing and a bunch of gobbly goop along with it).<br />The screen protector ended coming off shortly after applying it, so I had to use the second one, and had the same problem.  Completely unusable. Original Review :  I like how easy this was to apply.  (My last product actually cracked WHILE I was applying it!)  There are a few issues with it, however:  1) The instructions are written in really tiny print on the box, so I actually had to use a magnifying glass to read them!  2) There is no cutout for the front camera lens.  This didn't appear to affect the ""selfie"" function, however, so probably not a big issue if you make sure it is adhered well over the lens. 3) Most importantly, it does not register your fingerprint once installed on your phone screen.  (I didn't try to do this first, however, so maybe it would work that way, but I don't think it would.)  I personally don't use the biometric function on my phone because I don't like being forced to have a screen lock, so the lack of fingerprint capability doesn't matter to me.  If you do use a fingerprint unlock, I don't recommend this screen.  For me, however, it's just fine. Hopefully it actually protects the phone, since I do drop it occasionally, but I can't speak to that issue yet, since I just installed it.

5.0,Finally found my case!,"For clarification: I purchased this case in the combo package with the matching holster in the black color. That is why it doesn't show this review as an Amazon verified purchase. I thought it would be best to post my review here as well since this is identical to my purchase but the inclusion of the holster.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />My husband and I both have a Droid Razr Maxx. His was purchased October 2, 2012 and mine was purchased March 21, 2013.<br /><br />We originally purchased two [[ASIN:B006WC0U4G Otterbox Commuter Case for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]] as I had an Otterbox on my previous phone (a Droid Incredible 2) and loved it. The silicone flaps covering the access ports on the Otterbox Razr Maxx cases were nothing short of a disappointment. They never seated correctly and were always coming loose and flapping around allowing dust and particles into the ports. One of the reasons for purchasing the Otterbox cases was because it had these port covers. Since those failed to perform correctly these cases were removed from our phones and they have been naked and without protection for about a week now.<br /><br />After extensive research of countless cases and reviews here on Amazon, I purchased this case along with three others in a desperate attempt to find the right case for our Droid Razr Maxx phones, once and for all. The cases purchased and compared were:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00829HLZS Asmyna MOTXT912MHPCSO006NP Premium Durable Protective Case for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX XT912 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0077IQA2K Trident Case AG-XT912-BK AEGIS Case for Motorola Droid Razr MAXX (XT912) - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007KZQNP4 Seidio BD2-HR3MTRM-BK SURFACE Case and Holster Combo for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007PPYXME Seidio BD2-HK3MTRMK-BK ACTIVE Combo with Metal Kickstand for Motorola Droid RAZR MAXX - Retail Packaging - Black]]<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />First, the Asmyna:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-It is easy to 'install'.<br />-The front and back pieces audibly snap together and seems to hold firm.<br />-It feels good in the hand, being somewhat slick and glossy.<br />-Does not add bulk to an already sizable phone.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-It does not line up properly with the camera, flash, speaker or noise-cancelling speaker on the back of the phone.<br />-It is too slick, causing it to slide off of just about any surface.<br />-It is extremely prone to fingerprints.<br />-All ports are openly exposed to the elements (dust and particle collection, moisture, etc.)<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I would not recommend this case as, for me, its cons outweigh its pros. I also cannot attest to this product's ability to protect a phone from a drop as I did not feel confident that it would stay on the phone upon any kind of impact. So I chose not to submit my $600 phone to what I deemed an imminent death. This case will be returned.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Next, the Trident Aegis:<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Sturdy, two part design.<br />-Everything lined up beautifully on my Razr Maxx.<br />-Install was a breeze, with only a little encouraging to get the inner silicone liner to set inside the lip of the outer hard shell casing.<br />-The outer hard shell has two built-in mesh-like dust covers that go over the rear speaker and the noise-cancelling speaker when installed on the phone.<br />-The design on the back of the inside silicone liner pokes through the back of the outer hard shell and slightly raises the phone off any surface it is laying on, thus making the speaker sound un-muffled. This is a difficult feature to find in cases these days (why manufacturers don't just place the speaker on the front of the phone for this very reason, is beyond me).<br />-All ports are covered by silicone flaps.<br />-Accessibility to the MicroSD and Sim cards without case removal.<br />-Power and volume buttons are covered and operate as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-When laying face down, the outer rim of the case provides protection to the touch screen by slightly raising it off of any surface it is placed on.<br />-Adds bulk, but not as much as the Otterbox Commuter case.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-There are two locations (along the edge of the MicroSD and Sim card protection flap and along the front, top, center of the phone - directly above 'Motorola') on the silicone liner where the silicone is in extremely thin strips. I do not see these holding up very long as I can see these ripping or tearing after sufficient use.<br />-The protective flaps are flimsy and do not set into place very well (with the exception of the headphone jack cover, which seats almost too well).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />Even though I have listed more pros than cons, I will not be keeping this case. To me, a cell phone case should be something that you can easily install (and remove if necessary) and not be something that you have to continuously battle to stay in place on your phone. Although it is not a deal breaker for me if a phone has protective flaps over access ports or not - it does matter to me that if a case does have these that they set in place properly and not flap around freely. I also am fearful of the longevity of this case given the thinness of the inner silicone liner. For these reasons, I believe I will be returning this Trident Aegis case.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />Next, the Seidio Surface (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Lined up well with the camera, flash, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and all buttons.<br />-Does not add any noticeable bulk.<br />-Exterior surface is has a soft-to-the-touch feeling while remaining hard.<br />-Includes a holster.<br />-MicroSD/Sim card access door area of the case is solid. (This may be a con to others, but I prefer this be solid as I rarely ever need to access my SD or Sim cards.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />-No silicone components making it very slick.<br />-Easy to put on the phone, but be prepared for an all out battle to remove it. I spent close to fifteen minutes fighting this thing, trying to coerce it off of my phone. Due to its lack of any silicone, I could not get a good grip on the case and had to turn my phone off as I kept pressing the power and volume buttons in my all out brawl.<br />-All ports are exposed (except the MicroSD and Sim card access door, see Pros list above).<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />This case is laughable. It is the only case in my many years of cell phone ownership to cause me so much frustration upon trying to remove it from my phone. The scenario I found myself in while trying to remove the case was very similar to trying to get out of a Chinese finger trap - pretty much every movement makes things worse. I prefer a case to fit snugly, as those offer the best protection because they will not slip or slide on the phone. But this Seidio Surface case, wow.. needless to say, despite the pros I listed for it, this case will be returned.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />And, finally, the Seidio Active (Case and Holster Combo):<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Does not add much bulk (as compared to the Otterbox Commuter)<br />-Well thought out and functional two part design<br />-Feels good in the hand<br />-Easy to operate while holding in one hand (not too heavy)<br />-Silicone along the edges makes is very easy to grip and keep your grip. This case will rarely slip from your grasp.<br />-All ports and the camera, speaker, noise-cancelling speaker and buttons line up perfectly.<br />-Power and volume buttons respond with the same (if not better!) sensitivity as if there was no case on the phone.<br />-The MicroSD and Sim card access door is completely blocked (again, I know some others may prefer to have access to this door, but this is a preference of mine as I hardly ever need to remove/replace these cards).<br />-The kickstand is a fun addition - is functional and seems as though it would last quite awhile as long as you were gentle when pulling it from its seated magnetic position.<br />-Includes a belt holster which fits the phone w/case perfectly.<br />-The phone w/case can be seated in the included holster either facing in or out.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The addition of the kickstand on the back causes the phone to tilt toward the top - this muffles the rear speaker.<br />-With so much silicone exposed on the sides of the phone, I can see the potential for these areas being dust magnets.<br />-The top ports (HDMI, Power and headphone jack) are left openly exposed. Although this is not a deal breaker for me, it may be for others. (NOTE: Because the phone can be inserted into the holster either faced in or out, the holster's clip partially covers the top ports, offering some protection. Not much, but thought I would mention it.)<br />-The retention clip on the holster appears to have a disadvantage because of its design - due to the curve and the distance the clip extends from the phone, I can see this potentially catching on things (seat belts, couches, chairs, etc.) and either breaking the clip entirely, rendering the holster useless and requiring a replacement be purchased OR dislodging the phone from the holster allowing it to fall to the ground.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />I believe I finally found the case I have been searching for - the Seidio Active. My husband also chose this case of the four we received and I have reviewed here. So, I guess that means I need to purchase another one for myself. The black is exactly what my husband wanted, but I prefer a color that stands out more.. so I suppose I will be buying the red or blue. Once I receive that case, I will update my review to report on the clarity of the color as opposed to the color depicted here online.<br /><br />Thank you for reading. I hope my search helps someone else find the perfect case for them too (as well as saving them the time of conducting the research!).",2013-07-13 00:56:58,0,False,finally found case,clarification

3.0,Slippery When Not Wet,"The very first thing I wondered after holding this case is: Why did they have to make it so slippery? What was the point of making it slippery? I do not understand.<br /><br />Were there many people requesting a slippery case for their expensive iPhone 6 and/or 6S? (I know I certainly wasn't.)<br /><br />I can think of other materials they could have used that would not have resulted in a slippery case.<br /><br />On a different note: The company goes out of its way here at Amazon to brag how their case is Apple MFi certified. They neglect, however, to mention in advance that in spite of this MFi certification some people can still expect to get the error message on their iPhone that &#34;this accessory might not be supported.&#34; (They do include this fact on the instruction sheet you get with the case.)<br /><br />Sadly, at the current asking price for this case I cannot recommend it to those who do not want a slippery-feeling Qi charging case because of its slippery feel. Hopefully the company will eventually release a second generation case that is not as slippery, for those who prefer that.<br /><br />I do recommend this case for those who do not mind a slippery-feeling Qi charging case.<br /><br />To put your iPhone into this case you pull up very hard (it takes a bit of effort...perhaps too much effort) on the upper piece of the case. Slide your phone into the case and then snap the top back on.<br /><br />I like the fact the case is lightweight. I love the pull-out lightning connector at the bottom so you can insert a lightning cable when you are away from your Qi charging base.

5.0,"Nice, attractive, well-made!!","My wine bottle is approximately 13&#34; in circumference.  So, that is considered a large bottle of wine.  Therefore, you cannot put two of those in the bag.

You may need to do some adjusting with the location that holds the bottle opener, cause the two may clash.<br /><br />IF you have average single bottles that have less number in circumference, you can do it.  This attractive bag comes equipped with its own bottle opener a cork Screw, foil cutter  and bottle opener with built-in corkscrew holder.  The bag is well-insulated, and even has a padded divider to separate the two bottles and keep them from clanking into one another.<br /><br />There is a long side pocket and I am not sure what you would put there, but it is handy to have.

The screen is still 💯 % responsive and sensitive. The ringer off/on switch is covered by a dial, works great. The charging portal is covered by a flap that audibly “clicks “ when closed. Power button on right and both left buttons are covered by plastic coverings and remain sensitive. Screen shots are just as easy, for example.

5.0,Fabulous Case for Droid Turbo Ballistic Nylon,"The PureGear fits my Turbo BN perfectly. I am quite pleased with all aspects of this case. The precision cuts for the camera/flash/sensor/speakers on the rear of the case are perfect. As are the cutouts for the headphones jack and charging port. The aesthetics of my BN finish are not covered which is one of the main reasons I wanted to give this case a try. The PureGear puts my BN backing on display nicely. (Now if I could just figure out how to remove the Verizon logo from the BN back.. it appears to be similar to an iron-on patch or whatnot. I've noticed some Turbo BN phones do not even have the VZW logo. Would be wonderful if someone has removed this and take a few moments to explain the process to me!)<br /><br />From my experience with cases for past phones, this is extremely thin and lightweight. It doesn't appear to add much bulk, if any. With eyes closed, I wouldn't even realize a case was on my Turbo except for the grippy plastic feeling. A major bonus for me as the Turbo is pushing the limits of my female hands when it's naked, let alone in a case.<br /><br />As for slipperiness, which I know is an issue most have with the clear cases... check out the picture below. I tried to take a picture of the back of my hand to emphasize the angle the phone is at, but I about dropped my phone, lol. Suffice it to say, in this picture, the phone in the PureGear case is resting on my palm.. no fingers are gripping it nor is a corner resting on my palm.. absolutely no support is provided to the phone/case combo. My hand is at about a 85 degree angle and the case is not slipping. Needless to say, I am pleased with the no-slip-grip it seems to have. Granted, if you put this on a slick surface, like a book, binder or arm of the couch.. then yes, it will glide right off. To me however, it is the grip in hand that counts and so far it's got it where it counts. lol<br /><br />Only issues I have noticed..<br /><br />It is rather difficult to remove once it's on the phone. This may ease over time and use. However, on the other hand, it is also a comfort knowing that it is on my phone snug and won't slip off on a corner like some other cases for the Turbo BN are known to do.<br /><br />Also, the power button responds without much extra effort but the volume buttons/rocker is another story. I have to press harder than I believe I should to get any reaction from them. Hopefully, like with the difficulty of removing the case, the stiffness in the buttons will relax over time as well.<br /><br />Neither of these issues are deal breakers for me. I still love the case and the appearance of my phone in it. Overall, I would deduct only 1/2 a star, if I could, for these. As it is, I'll rate it as a 5 here as I don't see these issues as being bad enough to merit a full star reduction.<br /><br />Since I am a case fanatic, I will certainly be ordering a few others so I can swap them out depending on my mood (actually eyeballing the clear/black option from PureGear right now). But the PureGear clear/clear will remain in my arsenal and for now will serve as permanent case. Personally, I give it 4.5 stars (reduced due to the slight difficulty of removing it).",2015-02-09 23:42:32,5,True,fabulous case droid turbo ballistic nylon,puregear fit turbo bn perfectly quite pleased aspect case precision cut cameraflashsensorspeakers rear case perfect cutout headphone jack charging port aesthetic bn finish covered one main reason wanted give case try puregear put bn backing display nicely could figure remove verizon logo bn back appears similar ironon patch whatnot ive noticed turbo bn phone even vzw logo would wonderful someone removed take moment explain process mebr br experience case past phone extremely thin lightweight doesnt appear add much bulk eye closed wouldnt even realize case turbo except grippy plastic feeling major bonus turbo pushing limit female hand naked let alone casebr br slipperiness know issue clear case check picture tried take picture back hand emphasize angle phone dropped phone lol suffice say picture phone puregear case resting palm finger gripping corner resting palm absolutely support provided phonecase combo hand 85 degree angle case slipping needless say pleased noslipgrip seems granted put slick surface like book binder arm couch yes glide right however grip hand count far got count lolbr br issue noticedbr br rather difficult remove phone may ease time use however hand also comfort knowing phone snug wont slip corner like case turbo bn known dobr br also power button responds without much extra effort volume buttonsrocker another story press harder believe get reaction hopefully like difficulty removing case stiffness button relax time wellbr br neither issue deal breaker still love case appearance phone overall would deduct 12 star could ill rate 5 dont see issue bad enough merit full star reductionbr br since case fanatic certainly ordering others swap depending mood actually eyeballing clearblack option puregear right puregear clearclear remain arsenal serve permanent case personally give 45 star reduced due slight difficulty removing,fabulous case droid turbo ballistic nylon puregear fit turbo bn perfectly quite pleased aspect case precision cut cameraflashsensorspeakers rear case perfect cutout headphone jack charging port aesthetic bn finish covered one main reason wanted give case try puregear put bn backing display nicely could figure remove verizon logo bn back appears similar ironon patch whatnot ive noticed turbo bn phone even vzw logo would wonderful someone removed take moment explain process mebr br experience case past phone extremely thin lightweight doesnt appear add much bulk eye closed wouldnt even realize case turbo except grippy plastic feeling major bonus turbo pushing limit female hand naked let alone casebr br slipperiness know issue clear case check picture tried take picture back hand emphasize angle phone dropped phone lol suffice say picture phone puregear case resting palm finger gripping corner resting palm absolutely support provided phonecase combo hand 85 degree angle case slipping needless say pleased noslipgrip seems granted put slick surface like book binder arm couch yes glide right however grip hand count far got count lolbr br issue noticedbr br rather difficult remove phone may ease time use however hand also comfort knowing phone snug wont slip corner like case turbo bn known dobr br also power button responds without much extra effort volume buttonsrocker another story press harder believe get reaction hopefully like difficulty removing case stiffness button relax time wellbr br neither issue deal breaker still love case appearance phone overall would deduct 12 star could ill rate 5 dont see issue bad enough merit full star reductionbr br since case fanatic certainly ordering others swap depending mood actually eyeballing clearblack option puregear right puregear clearclear remain arsenal serve permanent case personally give 45 star reduced due slight difficulty removing,positive,2015,Phone Case

It’s a good idea to have spare charge cords for this purpose, since you never know when the need for additional power will be needed. A good option is this iPhone Charger Fast Charging Data Sync Transfer Cord with USB Wall Charger Travel Plug, made by Belcompany.<br /><br />With this charger, you get a pair of cords/plugs. This is nice, because you instantly have a spare that you can take with you to work, leave in your car, etc. Charging cords are easy to lose so it’s nice to have a pair of them.<br /><br />This charging cord will juice up an iPhone from near zero to one hundred percent in about 40 minutes. That means, with each 2- 3 minute period of charge, your phone will gain one percent. This is good speed and I like that the cord is over three feet in length. It is long enough that you can plug it into a nearby outlet and still be able to hold and use your phone.<br /><br />Keeping cell phones charged and ready to go is important. This package pair of charging cords from Belcompany is a good one overall. It gets phones charged in reasonable time and its practical design makes it useful for everyday needs.",2021-07-22 18:11:24,0,False,pair cord peace mind,know importance keeping electronics charged ready use good idea spare charge cord purpose since never know need additional power needed good option iphone charger fast charging data sync transfer cord usb wall charger travel plug made belcompanybr br charger get pair cordsplugs nice instantly spare take work leave car etc charging cord easy lose nice pair thembr br charging cord juice iphone near zero one hundred percent 40 minute mean 2 3 minute period charge phone gain one percent good speed like cord three foot length long enough plug nearby outlet still able hold use phonebr br keeping cell phone charged ready go important package pair charging cord belcompany good one overall get phone charged reasonable time practical design make useful everyday need,pair cord peace mind know importance keeping electronics charged ready use good idea spare charge cord purpose since never know need additional power needed good option iphone charger fast charging data sync transfer cord usb wall charger travel plug made belcompanybr br charger get pair cordsplugs nice instantly spare take work leave car etc charging cord easy lose nice pair thembr br charging cord juice iphone near zero one hundred percent 40 minute mean 2 3 minute period charge phone gain one percent good speed like cord three foot length long enough plug nearby outlet still able hold use phonebr br keeping cell phone charged ready go important package pair charging cord belcompany good one overall get phone charged reasonable time practical design make useful everyday need,positive,2021,Phone Charger
4.0,phone grip,"Just got my new Samsung S10+... I got a cover.  I have watched others using the finger grip... I wasn't sure if I would like it.  After trying several different kinds... (the ring was the worst - the edges were sharp and it was very uncomfortable) and I like this version.  I hold the phone in my left hand, using the pop up grip and use my right hand to navigate and use my phone... I am not a ""thumber""  You can stand you phone up with this one.. it pops out in about 3 different heights.. I like that because I can keep my phone off the table or other surfaces that might not be clean.  The design I chose sort of matches my cover... the ONE down side is that I cannot use my cordless charger.. for whatever reason, I am guessing it's because the grip lifts is just enough off the stand and it doesn't make contact.  Eh.  I got tired of taking my cover on and off every night, so I went back to cord charging.  I purchased another cover so I could go back to the cordless charger and not use the grip - but for now I am liking it.  I don't spend a huge amount of time staring at my phone (I don't twitter, you tube, etc).. but if you do, these really do relieve some tendon stress in my opinion.  Another note: once you peel off the sticker and place it on your outer case, whatever that is, you will NOT be removing it or moving the grip.  It's on - permanently.  So be certain about where you place it.  Having said all of that, I never hesitate to update my reviews should new info seem useful.",2019-03-30 04:03:48,0,True,phone grip,got new samsung s10 got cover watched others using finger grip wasnt sure would like trying several different kind ring worst edge sharp uncomfortable like version hold phone left hand using pop grip use right hand navigate use phone thumber stand phone one pop 3 different height like keep phone table surface might clean design chose sort match cover one side use cordless charger whatever reason guessing grip lift enough stand doesnt make contact eh got tired taking cover every night went back cord charging purchased another cover could go back cordless charger use grip liking dont spend huge amount time staring phone dont twitter tube etc really relieve tendon stress opinion another note peel sticker place outer case whatever removing moving grip permanently certain place said never hesitate update review new info seem useful,phone grip got new samsung s10 got cover watched others using finger grip wasnt sure would like trying several different kind ring worst edge sharp uncomfortable like version hold phone left hand using pop grip use right hand navigate use phone thumber stand phone one pop 3 different height like keep phone table surface might clean design chose sort match cover one side use cordless charger whatever reason guessing grip lift enough stand doesnt make contact eh got tired taking cover every night went back cord charging purchased another cover could go back cordless charger use grip liking dont spend huge amount time staring phone dont twitter tube etc really relieve tendon stress opinion another note peel sticker place outer case whatever removing moving grip permanently certain place said never hesitate update review new info seem useful,positive,2019,Phone Stand

5.0,Tiny Bank with Super Fast Charging,"Having you cellphone or other USB rechargeable device run out of power when away from any ability to charge it has happened to most of us and it is always inconvenient. The last time I was in that situation I decided I was going to keep charged power banks with me so it didn’t happen to me again.

1.0,T-Mobile-specific review.  Signal boosting...  if you're standing within 10 feet of it.,"This review will be specific to T-Mobile customers.<br /><br />The big question for anyone interested in this product is whether it does what it says.  The quick answer is No.  But we need to  break down exactly what is claimed:<br /><br />My test conditions:<br /> - T-Mobile provider<br /> - MyTouch 4g and BLU Studio 5 II<br /> - Suburbs of Cleveland, Ohio<br /><br />As a comparison, I have a cel-fi provided by T-Mobile for free but needed another signal booster for my parents who are also under my phone plan.<br /><br />Setup:<br /> The setup for the zBoost is fairly simple.  An external antenna is connected by a coax cable to the booster itself and the booster is plugged in to the wall socket for power.  The next challenge is to find the right position for the external antenna.<br /><br />Tip:<br />As other reviews have noted, the separation between external antenna and the booster unit is important, but the manual suggests that it’s the VERTICAL distance that’s important.  It suggests a 10ft VERTICAL separation between the external antenna and the booster unit.<br /><br />Claims:<br /> - Dual Band (800/1900):  Searching Google shows that T-Mobile deployed the 1900 frequency between 2012 - 2013.  This means that phones older than 2012 will not work with this signal booster for 3G.  The MyTouch 4g did NOT work with this signal booster at all.  Not even for Edge.  The BLU Studio worked.<br /> - Up To 2,500 sq ft. coverage:  The zBoost fails here.  It’s a separate issue from whether you’ve found the optimal position for the external antenna.  Holding the BLU Studio, I get 5 bars at 5 feet from the booster unit, but walk away to 25 feet and the signal falls to about 2 bars.  Walk to the next room and the signal disconnects and calls are no longer possible.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />First thing to note about this unit is how old your phone is.  T-Mobile started providing the 1900 frequency to attract iPhone customers away from ATT and coverage for that frequency is spottier than their already poor coverage (popular opinion, not mine).<br />Compared to the T-Mobile Cel-Fi, the T-Mo unit stays connected at 40 feet at 2 bars.  So while both units have very short broadcast distances, the zBoost is inexcusable.  Exclusive of whether it is possible to find an optimal location for the external antenna at your location, the lack of coverage from the booster unit negates the usefulness of this device -- especially for the price they charge for it.  I’d like to say that you should give the T-Mo units a try but the ones on Amazon are sold by individuals so you may not be able to return them if they don’t work out.",2014-09-03 17:22:08,1,True,tmobilespecific review signal boosting youre standing within 10 foot,review specific tmobile customersbr br big question anyone interested product whether say quick answer need break exactly claimedbr br test conditionsbr tmobile providerbr mytouch 4g blu studio 5 iibr suburb cleveland ohiobr br comparison celfi provided tmobile free needed another signal booster parent also phone planbr br setupbr setup zboost fairly simple external antenna connected coax cable booster booster plugged wall socket power next challenge find right position external antennabr br tipbr review noted separation external antenna booster unit important manual suggests vertical distance thats important suggests 10ft vertical separation external antenna booster unitbr br claimsbr dual band 8001900 searching google show tmobile deployed 1900 frequency 2012 2013 mean phone older 2012 work signal booster 3g mytouch 4g work signal booster even edge blu studio workedbr 2500 sq ft coverage zboost fails separate issue whether youve found optimal position external antenna holding blu studio get 5 bar 5 foot booster unit walk away 25 foot signal fall 2 bar walk next room signal disconnect call longer possiblebr br conclusionbr first thing note unit old phone tmobile started providing 1900 frequency attract iphone customer away att coverage frequency spottier already poor coverage popular opinion minebr compared tmobile celfi tmo unit stay connected 40 foot 2 bar unit short broadcast distance zboost inexcusable exclusive whether possible find optimal location external antenna location lack coverage booster unit negates usefulness device especially price charge id like say give tmo unit try one amazon sold individual may able return dont work,tmobilespecific review signal boosting youre standing within 10 foot review specific tmobile customersbr br big question anyone interested product whether say quick answer need break exactly claimedbr br test conditionsbr tmobile providerbr mytouch 4g blu studio 5 iibr suburb cleveland ohiobr br comparison celfi provided tmobile free needed another signal booster parent also phone planbr br setupbr setup zboost fairly simple external antenna connected coax cable booster booster plugged wall socket power next challenge find right position external antennabr br tipbr review noted separation external antenna booster unit important manual suggests vertical distance thats important suggests 10ft vertical separation external antenna booster unitbr br claimsbr dual band 8001900 searching google show tmobile deployed 1900 frequency 2012 2013 mean phone older 2012 work signal booster 3g mytouch 4g work signal booster even edge blu studio workedbr 2500 sq ft coverage zboost fails separate issue whether youve found optimal position external antenna holding blu studio get 5 bar 5 foot booster unit walk away 25 foot signal fall 2 bar walk next room signal disconnect call longer possiblebr br conclusionbr first thing note unit old phone tmobile started providing 1900 frequency attract iphone customer away att coverage frequency spottier already poor coverage popular opinion minebr compared tmobile celfi tmo unit stay connected 40 foot 2 bar unit short broadcast distance zboost inexcusable exclusive whether possible find optimal location external antenna location lack coverage booster unit negates usefulness device especially price charge id like say give tmo unit try one amazon sold individual may able return dont work,positive,2014,Phone Holder

5.0,"�Bend It Like Beckham� a riot of laughs, drama and football.","A friend in London (England, not Ontario) convinced me that I had to see ""Bend It Like Beckham,"" (along with praise from Sundance and the Toronto Film Festival) so lo and behold, one dreary spring day I stepped into a surprisingly crowded theatre (I wasn't sure of a British comedy's marketability in North America). ""BILB"" proved every bit as wonderful as my friend said, and in a nutshell is a sort of cross between ""Monsoon Wedding"" and ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding.""<br />Jess, a Londoner of Asian descent, plays football in secret since her parents strictly forbid it and want her to grow into a nice, traditional Sikh girl who can cook a full Punjabi dinner. Jess, however, has other plans. She teams up with Jules (short for Juliet), a fellow footballer, and the team coach Joe and an American scout eagerly appraises the two. Along the way Jess has to survive her sister's frantic, bipolar engagement and wedding, come clean to her parents about her joining the team, fights over her blossoming romance, and learns to follow her heart. Jess confides her worries to her David Beckham poster that hangs over her bed. Her room is filled with Beckham memorabilia. Jules' mother is similarly against her daughter playing football, convinced that she must be a lesbian since she favours sports bras, has short hair and wears boyish clothes. The two girls hang out often, finding more similarities than differences, but when Jess nearly kisses Joe, Jules is furious, having eyed him for herself, and a stony rivalry ensues.<br />The film is doused with Indian culture, including saris, salwar kameez, samosas, Bollywood musicals, singing game shows, bhangra rock, and more, but always finds a more or less comfortable balance between Indian and London cultures. The unbelievably colourful, extravagant wedding was one of my favourite highlights of the film since I adore bhangra rock and Bollywood. The soundtrack is similarly influenced, with many Indian pop songs, and my favourite of all, ""The Power of Love"" cover (Sitam version) by Amar. The cinematography is at times used for comedic effect, as in rapid cutaways to see the dazed/shocked/delighted expression of parents and relatives, in dizzying, rapid-fire football matches, the colourful exuberance of the Indian wedding, the sizzling energy of a German nightclub, and at times timed shots to capture the beauty of day turning into dusk.<br />The movie is blessed with a strong cast, a great story, and characters that draw you into their worlds, worries, and triumphs, not to mention a catchy soundtrack, great football action, and a tender romance. ""Bend It Like Beckham"" will certainly join my other honoured favourites such as ""Monsoon Wedding"" and ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding."" Oh, and look for a ""There's Something About Mary""-like singalong/bloopers during the credits. If you love football, romantic comedies, and/or Indian culture, you will surely score with ""Bend It Like Beckham.""",2003-05-13 02:10:33,4,False,bend like beckham riot laugh drama football,friend london england ontario convinced see bend like beckham along praise sundance toronto film festival lo behold one dreary spring day stepped surprisingly crowded theatre wasnt sure british comedy marketability north america bilb proved every bit wonderful friend said nutshell sort cross monsoon wedding big fat greek weddingbr jess londoner asian descent play football secret since parent strictly forbid want grow nice traditional sikh girl cook full punjabi dinner jess however plan team jules short juliet fellow footballer team coach joe american scout eagerly appraises two along way jess survive sister frantic bipolar engagement wedding come clean parent joining team fight blossoming romance learns follow heart jess confides worry david beckham poster hang bed room filled beckham memorabilia jules mother similarly daughter playing football convinced must lesbian since favour sport bra short hair wear boyish clothes two girl hang often finding similarity difference jess nearly kiss joe jules furious eyed stony rivalry ensuesbr film doused indian culture including sari salwar kameez samosa bollywood musical singing game show bhangra rock always find less comfortable balance indian london culture unbelievably colourful extravagant wedding one favourite highlight film since adore bhangra rock bollywood soundtrack similarly influenced many indian pop song favourite power love cover sitam version amar cinematography time used comedic effect rapid cutaway see dazedshockeddelighted expression parent relative dizzying rapidfire football match colourful exuberance indian wedding sizzling energy german nightclub time timed shot capture beauty day turning duskbr movie blessed strong cast great story character draw world worry triumph mention catchy soundtrack great football action tender romance bend like beckham certainly join honoured favourite monsoon wedding big fat greek wedding oh look there something marylike singalongbloopers credit love football romantic comedy andor indian culture surely score bend like beckham,bend like beckham riot laugh drama football friend london england ontario convinced see bend like beckham along praise sundance toronto film festival lo behold one dreary spring day stepped surprisingly crowded theatre wasnt sure british comedy marketability north america bilb proved every bit wonderful friend said nutshell sort cross monsoon wedding big fat greek weddingbr jess londoner asian descent play football secret since parent strictly forbid want grow nice traditional sikh girl cook full punjabi dinner jess however plan team jules short juliet fellow footballer team coach joe american scout eagerly appraises two along way jess survive sister frantic bipolar engagement wedding come clean parent joining team fight blossoming romance learns follow heart jess confides worry david beckham poster hang bed room filled beckham memorabilia jules mother similarly daughter playing football convinced must lesbian since favour sport bra short hair wear boyish clothes two girl hang often finding similarity difference jess nearly kiss joe jules furious eyed stony rivalry ensuesbr film doused indian culture including sari salwar kameez samosa bollywood musical singing game show bhangra rock always find less comfortable balance indian london culture unbelievably colourful extravagant wedding one favourite highlight film since adore bhangra rock bollywood soundtrack similarly influenced many indian pop song favourite power love cover sitam version amar cinematography time used comedic effect rapid cutaway see dazedshockeddelighted expression parent relative dizzying rapidfire football match colourful exuberance indian wedding sizzling energy german nightclub time timed shot capture beauty day turning duskbr movie blessed strong cast great story character draw world worry triumph mention catchy soundtrack great football action tender romance bend like beckham certainly join honoured favourite monsoon wedding big fat greek wedding oh look there something marylike singalongbloopers credit love football romantic comedy andor indian culture surely score bend like beckham,positive,2003,Screen Protector

3.0,Decent inexpensive case with quirks.,All things considered this is a lot of case for the money. The two piece shell is reasonably durable and looks good. The softer sides allow easy  operation of the side buttons. My main issue with this case is the protective clear glass that covers the screen. It has an odd prismatic effect that is clearly visible at certain angles and in certain kinds of light. The glass cover saps some of the vibrancy out of the A71's exceptional OLED screen and attracts dirt around the edges and the punch hole.,2021-10-05 01:19:48,3,True,decent inexpensive case quirk,thing considered lot case money two piece shell reasonably durable look good softer side allow easy operation side button main issue case protective clear glass cover screen odd prismatic effect clearly visible certain angle certain kind light glass cover sap vibrancy a71s exceptional oled screen attracts dirt around edge punch hole,decent inexpensive case quirk thing considered lot case money two piece shell reasonably durable look good softer side allow easy operation side button main issue case protective clear glass cover screen odd prismatic effect clearly visible certain angle certain kind light glass cover sap vibrancy a71s exceptional oled screen attracts dirt around edge punch hole,positive,2021,Screen Protector

I purchased my first one of these at the Sprint Store when I purchased my Galaxy 7 a month ago. I do love the ease and FAST charging ability. My phone is fully charged in about 1 hour. I purchased the black, two of them through Amazon. They both arrived with WHITE cords.... odd..... ?? The cords have a mini usb tip on one side, you plug into the stand itself (or, in a pinch directly into your phone - although it wouldn't be a &#34;fast charge I don't think), the other end is a large usb tip that can be plugged into a computer, or other large usb charging receptacle OR to the wall unit that works in a regular plug in. The cord feels sturdy so it should last. It's about 2ft in length - just eyeballing it. It doesn't seem to effect the charging ability that the cord color doesn't match the base... I noticed that the one I purchased from Sprint had matching color cord... and is silent (there is a small fan). One of the these is a bit noisier - you can hear the fan every so often.

3.0,Works great with my Galaxy S5; not so great with my iPad 2.,"The only other stylus for touchscreens I've owned was a $10, so that's the only basis I can go off of. I've been wanting to own a ""premium"" stylus with more accuracy, so I was pretty giddy when this came in the mail.<br /><br />The first thing I tried it on was my Galaxy S5. I know this stylus is touted for the iOS devices, but I wanted to give it a shot anyway. The phone wouldn't recognize the pen, so I enabled Touch Sensitivity and sure enough the stylus worked like any other stylus.<br /><br />Next, I tried it on my iPad 2. I turned on Bluetooth, but the iPad won't detect the stylus. I followed the instructions to the dot, but I'm not sure what the issue is. It could be the stylus, it could be the iPad; I'm guessing it may be my iPad. I'm going to keep trying.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I downloaded two free apps to try it out. Photoshop was one of them as I like to have a doodle app to fiddle with. There was a slight split-second delay between my drawing and when the iPad registered it. That, and the line on the iPad was slightly lower. I'm guessing that once I connect the Bluetooth properly it may be better, but that's what I'm stuck with for now.<br /><br />Immediately after that, I tried it on my S5 again. It worked flawlessly, and I didn't have to turn on Touch Sensitivities. I should note that I have a glass screen protector on my S5 and a plastic one (Otterbox) on my iPad.

1.0,It WIL NOT protect your phone from drops!,"I bought this case on March 14, 2014 for my Galaxy S4.  I previously had the phone in a Toughsuit yet the rotating clip on the holster was prone to constantly breaking.  The case itself seems great.<br /><br />I have owned a few items from Otterbox and after reading the reviews for the Defender case I figured this was a tough enough case to keep my phone safe.  It looked great, fit the phone perfect and felt great in my hand.  From assemblying the phone into the case I thought I was going to be ok because it felt solid and very protected inside the Defender case.<br /><br />I was 100% wrong.<br /><br />On April 16th I was walking at work when the phone slipped off the holster that was on my hip and stuck the cement floor face first.  I didn’t think much about it because the Otterbox Defender case is advertised as being able to protect from drops.<br /><br />When I picked up my phone and turned it over to look at the face I was aghast.  The Corning Gorilla Glass 3 was shattered into so many pieces I could not see anything on it except distorted rays of light.  I am 6’-1” tall and figured the phone fell from a distance of about 3 feet.<br /><br />The Defender case couldn’t protect the phone from such a short distance?  The phone wasn’t kicked, stepped on nor anything else- it fell to the cement floor face first.  Neither the phone nor the case had any modifications nor defects to either of them (perhaps the holster does- the phone was clipped in securely when I placed it there).<br /><br />I had insurance on the phone so for about 30% of the original price I got my replacement in one shipping day yet I am not sure Otterbox can make such great claims about a case that the phone didn’t survive a 3 foot drop to a cement floor.  I wrote to Otterbox and their response was, of course, they cannot do anything for me.<br /><br />My replacement phone is back in the Toughsuit case which is advertised as “engineered to meet MIL-STD-810G military standards”- I will simply buy another Toughsuit case for the holster and get Bodyglove to send me a replacement holster also.<br /><br />I will never buy anything from Otterbox again.",2014-04-18 06:35:57,4,True,wil protect phone drop,bought case march 14 2014 galaxy s4 previously phone toughsuit yet rotating clip holster prone constantly breaking case seems greatbr br owned item otterbox reading review defender case figured tough enough case keep phone safe looked great fit phone perfect felt great hand assemblying phone case thought going ok felt solid protected inside defender casebr br 100 wrongbr br april 16th walking work phone slipped holster hip stuck cement floor face first didnt think much otterbox defender case advertised able protect dropsbr br picked phone turned look face aghast corning gorilla glass 3 shattered many piece could see anything except distorted ray light 61 tall figured phone fell distance 3 feetbr br defender case couldnt protect phone short distance phone wasnt kicked stepped anything else fell cement floor face first neither phone case modification defect either perhaps holster phone clipped securely placed therebr br insurance phone 30 original price got replacement one shipping day yet sure otterbox make great claim case phone didnt survive 3 foot drop cement floor wrote otterbox response course anything mebr br replacement phone back toughsuit case advertised engineered meet milstd810g military standard simply buy another toughsuit case holster get bodyglove send replacement holster alsobr br never buy anything otterbox,wil protect phone drop bought case march 14 2014 galaxy s4 previously phone toughsuit yet rotating clip holster prone constantly breaking case seems greatbr br owned item otterbox reading review defender case figured tough enough case keep phone safe looked great fit phone perfect felt great hand assemblying phone case thought going ok felt solid protected inside defender casebr br 100 wrongbr br april 16th walking work phone slipped holster hip stuck cement floor face first didnt think much otterbox defender case advertised able protect dropsbr br picked phone turned look face aghast corning gorilla glass 3 shattered many piece could see anything except distorted ray light 61 tall figured phone fell distance 3 feetbr br defender case couldnt protect phone short distance phone wasnt kicked stepped anything else fell cement floor face first neither phone case modification defect either perhaps holster phone clipped securely placed therebr br insurance phone 30 original price got replacement one shipping day yet sure otterbox make great claim case phone didnt survive 3 foot drop cement floor wrote otterbox response course anything mebr br replacement phone back toughsuit case advertised engineered meet milstd810g military standard simply buy another toughsuit case holster get bodyglove send replacement holster alsobr br never buy anything otterbox,positive,2014,Phone Case

4.0,Why occupy your space with a boring charger?  Now your favorite picture can do it!,"This is one of the coolest new products I’ve seen for a while - and it works GREAT.<br /><br />As soon as I saw it, I thought, why has no one thought of doing this before!!!<br /><br />The frame is a beautiful, modern black wood frame that holds a 5x7 picture.  The photo has to be portrait oriented as the frame must stand on the smaller side.<br /><br />The Qi charger that is built into the frame charges at up to 10 watts depending on what wattage adapter the power cord is plugged into.  The power cord was more than long enough for me to reach my adapter with ease.<br /><br />The frame accommodates my iPhone 8 Plus in its Lifeproof SLAM Series case (and would in other minimalist cases) but if you use bulkier cases, such as an Otterbox Defender on an iPhone Plus (or similar sized phone) it will not fit.<br /><br />The lights on the reverse side of the frame indicate when your device is charging (blue), fully charged (green) or if there is a foreign object interfering with charging, such as a metal plate or if your case was too thick (flashing blue).<br /><br />Based on the complaints I read, I recommend people measure their phone within their case to make sure it falls within the 165mm height restriction.  Typically if your case falls within that it will not have a back thicker than 3mm.<br /><br />The only thing that I would improve on this product would be to add a small mat and make the frame a little larger to accommodate phones with slightly bulkier cases.<br /><br />As far as my tests went, I found this to be an awesome product that worked flawlessly.

I have a thick Otterbox case on my phone and have found that the case is too thick for the magnets to work. The holder in my husband's car hasn't been working as well, so he was in need of replacing his.

4.0,"Good Lens, Clip is Passable","I have worked with a number of lenses for phones and I have seen some interesting variations. Some require a special case to work with a phone (and therefore are model-specific) while others use a special clip that clamps over the phone’s lens. This one falls into the latter design type and for what it is it’s very good, though there is room for a little improvement.<br /><br />There are two main components to this lens. There is the clip to which the lens attaches, and there is the lens itself which is actually a pair of lenses. The clip is a solid and sturdy thing with a strong grip so I will not slip off the phone when in use, a problem I have seen with lenses of this type on occasion. The part that touches the back of the phone has a thin foam pad that provides grip, and the pad has a slight swivel action to it so in theory it will lay flat regardless of the phone’s shape. It works in that regard, even with the phone case on.<br /><br />Now, that said, to get this lens to really work I have to take my phone out of its case. That’s inconvenient but not a deal breaker for me because my phone case is a simple slip-on case. For those using a more complex case it may prove to be more tedious. There are things that could have been done to make it fit regardless of the case.<br /><br />The lens itself is a two-piece assembly, as many are. When assembled it is a wide-angle lens that enhances the field of view in the shot, especially when zoomed out. When only the base is used, it is a high-magnification macro lens that is great for taking clear pics of things that are very close. In both cases, I have found the images to come out with very little distortion and the images are clear and sharp. For the macro lens test I used my thumb as a test subject and I was able to get good ridge detail on my thumb print.<br /><br />The lens includes a nice cloth bag that keeps it clean and protects it from scratches. It’s not much protection against crush damage when the lens is stored in a book bag but it’s certainly better than nothing and will keep the lens mostly pristine when on the go.<br /><br />This is a good lens, let down by a basic clamp that could have been better. If you don’t mind taking your phone out of the case to use this lens, the lens will serve you well and you’ll be rewarded with solid, clear pics.",2019-02-02 12:41:01,0,False,good lens clip passable,worked number lens phone seen interesting variation require special case work phone therefore modelspecific others use special clip clamp phone lens one fall latter design type good though room little improvementbr br two main component lens clip lens attache lens actually pair lens clip solid sturdy thing strong grip slip phone use problem seen lens type occasion part touch back phone thin foam pad provides grip pad slight swivel action theory lay flat regardless phone shape work regard even phone case onbr br said get lens really work take phone case thats inconvenient deal breaker phone case simple slipon case using complex case may prove tedious thing could done make fit regardless casebr br lens twopiece assembly many assembled wideangle lens enhances field view shot especially zoomed base used highmagnification macro lens great taking clear pic thing close case found image come little distortion image clear sharp macro lens test used thumb test subject able get good ridge detail thumb printbr br lens includes nice cloth bag keep clean protects scratch much protection crush damage lens stored book bag certainly better nothing keep lens mostly pristine gobr br good lens let basic clamp could better dont mind taking phone case use lens lens serve well youll rewarded solid clear pic,good lens clip passable worked number lens phone seen interesting variation require special case work phone therefore modelspecific others use special clip clamp phone lens one fall latter design type good though room little improvementbr br two main component lens clip lens attache lens actually pair lens clip solid sturdy thing strong grip slip phone use problem seen lens type occasion part touch back phone thin foam pad provides grip pad slight swivel action theory lay flat regardless phone shape work regard even phone case onbr br said get lens really work take phone case thats inconvenient deal breaker phone case simple slipon case using complex case may prove tedious thing could done make fit regardless casebr br lens twopiece assembly many assembled wideangle lens enhances field view shot especially zoomed base used highmagnification macro lens great taking clear pic thing close case found image come little distortion image clear sharp macro lens test used thumb test subject able get good ridge detail thumb printbr br lens includes nice cloth bag keep clean protects scratch much protection crush damage lens stored book bag certainly better nothing keep lens mostly pristine gobr br good lens let basic clamp could better dont mind taking phone case use lens lens serve well youll rewarded solid clear pic,positive,2019,Phone Case

2.0,Seriously Disappointing Case,"I've had several cases for my Galaxy S9 and this one disappointed me the most. I was using (and have gone back to) an Otterbox Symmetry case. I found my ports were getting some pocket lint in them, saw the Commuter case on a Gold Box special and jumped at the opportunity. Ten minutes on my phone was enough to decide, this is going back.<br />The inner lining is very soft and flimsy feeling. It didn't feel durable or protective. The outer hard-shell cover is thin, cheap plastic that feels brittle and easy to break. The Symmetry case had an overall texture that gave a positive feel in the hand. The hard parts of the Commuter are slick and slippery. It popped out of my hand just picking it up off the table. The covers for the charging and headphone ports are part of the inner material. Once wiggled free of the hard case they worked reasonably well. The one way in which this case was superior to the Symmetry is the ease of pressing the power button. The case material on the Symmetry is much stiffer which makes for a harder button press or double press to pull up the camera.<br />I honestly feel the Commuter case doesn't come close to the durability of the Symmetry and that it would not provide adequate protection for my phone.",2019-09-11 17:49:11,5,True,seriously disappointing case,ive several case galaxy s9 one disappointed using gone back otterbox symmetry case found port getting pocket lint saw commuter case gold box special jumped opportunity ten minute phone enough decide going backbr inner lining soft flimsy feeling didnt feel durable protective outer hardshell cover thin cheap plastic feel brittle easy break symmetry case overall texture gave positive feel hand hard part commuter slick slippery popped hand picking table cover charging headphone port part inner material wiggled free hard case worked reasonably well one way case superior symmetry ease pressing power button case material symmetry much stiffer make harder button press double press pull camerabr honestly feel commuter case doesnt come close durability symmetry would provide adequate protection phone,seriously disappointing case ive several case galaxy s9 one disappointed using gone back otterbox symmetry case found port getting pocket lint saw commuter case gold box special jumped opportunity ten minute phone enough decide going backbr inner lining soft flimsy feeling didnt feel durable protective outer hardshell cover thin cheap plastic feel brittle easy break symmetry case overall texture gave positive feel hand hard part commuter slick slippery popped hand picking table cover charging headphone port part inner material wiggled free hard case worked reasonably well one way case superior symmetry ease pressing power button case material symmetry much stiffer make harder button press double press pull camerabr honestly feel commuter case doesnt come close durability symmetry would provide adequate protection phone,positive,2019,Phone Case
4.0,Quick Charger!,"It is a requirement in my family, that all car chargers be able to charge more than one device. We don't have enough outlets for everyone to use a single charger. This charger has two different outputs (Mom gets the faster one!). I haven't driven any long distances with this yet, but I have noticed that my phone battery is usually &quot;topped off&quot; by the time I get to work after my 10 minute commute. Usually, my charger doesn't fully finish charging my Nexus 5 during that time. There is a small light that comes on when it's charging. However, that light is difficult to see during the daytime. I didn't even know there was a light until I was driving at night one evening and I saw the blue glow. I do wish the light was easier to see during the day. Sometimes a charger may not be fully inserted to the plug and won't be charging. When I see the light on, I know that it is charging.<br /><br />*I received this for free in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased review.

However, once I placed on the more flat area (slightly higher than the slope) it has worked. It covers about 1/3 of the vent - not a problem for me.  You'll want to follow the directions carefully for attachment to be successful.  It comes with 2 loose metal pieces for the magnet attachment - one large rectangle shape and one medium size round.  They have stickers on one side, I attached to my case and not my phone.  I had to stop using my cordless charger as my phone got really hot as charging - I am thinking the metal piece?  I'm not a tech wiz...- No problem with cord for charging.  Could be a faulty cordless charger too.  I plan to test that theory later.  The magnetic is very strong - holds phone securely.

Another factor in my high rating is the MFi (Made for iPod/iPad/iPhone) logo on the packaging and looks nearly identical to the real thing. The only things different are there is no Apple logo on the cable and it does not carry the Apple price tag. There are fake MFi products on the market, but they do not stay there long because Apple diligently polices that sort of thing.<br /><br />Although I have only been using this cable for a few days my prior experience with the 30-pin model (which is still being used on an old iPad) leads me to believe that this cable will be just as reliable.

4.0,"Solid clamp that can hold a Note 3, but cramped in some ways","I tested the review sample that I received on both handlebars and a boom microphone stand. It attaches solidly and will actually fit small diameter bars. The design, though, is based on a two position pivot on the quick release part. That will accommodate just about any size handlebar.<br /><br />The clamp holds my Galaxy Note 3 phone in a steady and positive manner. It is capable of gripping it while it's in its case, but the case is the weak point that could slip out (it's a fairly thick leather case). The point is it will hold the gigantic Note 3 with room to spare, and has soft inserts that prevent marring the phone, as well as dampening vibrations.<br /><br />Why four stars? The swivel ball assembly and compression nut are difficult to tighten because of the size of the clamp. You can sufficiently tighten them, but it takes some time. Perhaps this is a design limitation since if the holder had a longer post that would prevent the problem, the phone would sit too high. I do know that as is the phone is perfectly placed (for me) on both handlebars and the microphone stand boom (where I really use this mount.)<br /><br />Overall, this will hold phones steady - at least over relatively smooth terrain. I wouldn't use it for off-road and dirt biking, but otherwise love it.",2014-11-23 03:09:43,1,False,solid clamp hold note 3 cramped way,tested review sample received handlebar boom microphone stand attache solidly actually fit small diameter bar design though based two position pivot quick release part accommodate size handlebarbr br clamp hold galaxy note 3 phone steady positive manner capable gripping case case weak point could slip fairly thick leather case point hold gigantic note 3 room spare soft insert prevent marring phone well dampening vibrationsbr br four star swivel ball assembly compression nut difficult tighten size clamp sufficiently tighten take time perhaps design limitation since holder longer post would prevent problem phone would sit high know phone perfectly placed handlebar microphone stand boom really use mountbr br overall hold phone steady least relatively smooth terrain wouldnt use offroad dirt biking otherwise love,solid clamp hold note 3 cramped way tested review sample received handlebar boom microphone stand attache solidly actually fit small diameter bar design though based two position pivot quick release part accommodate size handlebarbr br clamp hold galaxy note 3 phone steady positive manner capable gripping case case weak point could slip fairly thick leather case point hold gigantic note 3 room spare soft insert prevent marring phone well dampening vibrationsbr br four star swivel ball assembly compression nut difficult tighten size clamp sufficiently tighten take time perhaps design limitation since holder longer post would prevent problem phone would sit high know phone perfectly placed handlebar microphone stand boom really use mountbr br overall hold phone steady least relatively smooth terrain wouldnt use offroad dirt biking otherwise love,positive,2014,Phone Case

5.0,Exceeded My Expectations,"I have used a number of different phone holders of different types, but this is the first one I have used that is mounted on the air vent. I have avoided this type of holder up to this point because I did not trust that they would hold well or would constantly force the vent to point downward from the weight of the holder. Summer is upon us, and I have had repeated problems with my phone overheating and shutting down so I decided to try this holder to see if it would help with that problem specifically. Now I wish I had been using this type of holder all along; it has proven to be far and away better than I expected.<br /><br />I will start by saying that my concerns with this type of holder seem to be unfounded. The holder does keep the vent open which is ok, and there is a little bit of play in the vent itself in terms of being able to move the fins, but the holder stays put and when attached properly it holds securely.<br /><br />Most spring-loaded holders with which I have worked use a spring to clamp closed on the devices they hold, but this one works in the opposite way. To close, the clamp must be manually closed and squeezed against the phone to secure the phone, and the button on the holder causes the clamp to pop open. This isn't a problem, it's just different than what I have seen before now.<br /><br />So, with the temperature close to 100 F in the car, I clamped the phone in place and cranked up the AC. I made two important observations. First, the holder was not as disruptive to air flow as I had thought it would be. Yes, it does block a good bit of air from direct flow but it does not close the vent or keep air from flowing, so it did not impact how well the car's AC worked. Second, even with the sun beating down on the phone, the phone was cooled enough by the AC to be cool to the touch and it never shut down on me.<br /><br />This phone holder solved an important issue for me and cleared up some of the misunderstandings I had about air vent mounts. It works well for me and it allows me to keep my phone alive when other solutions failed me. This is an easy product to recommend based on my experience with it.",2019-07-18 10:56:19,0,False,exceeded expectation,used number different phone holder different type first one used mounted air vent avoided type holder point trust would hold well would constantly force vent point downward weight holder summer upon u repeated problem phone overheating shutting decided try holder see would help problem specifically wish using type holder along proven far away better expectedbr br start saying concern type holder seem unfounded holder keep vent open ok little bit play vent term able move fin holder stay put attached properly hold securelybr br springloaded holder worked use spring clamp closed device hold one work opposite way close clamp must manually closed squeezed phone secure phone button holder cause clamp pop open isnt problem different seen nowbr br temperature close 100 f car clamped phone place cranked ac made two important observation first holder disruptive air flow thought would yes block good bit air direct flow close vent keep air flowing impact well car ac worked second even sun beating phone phone cooled enough ac cool touch never shut mebr br phone holder solved important issue cleared misunderstanding air vent mount work well allows keep phone alive solution failed easy product recommend based experience,exceeded expectation used number different phone holder different type first one used mounted air vent avoided type holder point trust would hold well would constantly force vent point downward weight holder summer upon u repeated problem phone overheating shutting decided try holder see would help problem specifically wish using type holder along proven far away better expectedbr br start saying concern type holder seem unfounded holder keep vent open ok little bit play vent term able move fin holder stay put attached properly hold securelybr br springloaded holder worked use spring clamp closed device hold one work opposite way close clamp must manually closed squeezed phone secure phone button holder cause clamp pop open isnt problem different seen nowbr br temperature close 100 f car clamped phone place cranked ac made two important observation first holder disruptive air flow thought would yes block good bit air direct flow close vent keep air flowing impact well car ac worked second even sun beating phone phone cooled enough ac cool touch never shut mebr br phone holder solved important issue cleared misunderstanding air vent mount work well allows keep phone alive solution failed easy product recommend based experience,positive,2019,Phone Holder

4.0,"Galaxy Note 9, Bands Obstruct Navigation, Not compatible with Wireless Chargers","So the device works well for my Galaxy Note 9 even with a case on it.

5.0,Durable and Versatile Power Banks,"I liked that this came as a twin pack. My son has given these some time to charge while riding his bike around the neighborhood between trips to visit grandma, the little corner shop and just to exercise. I would advise to use zip-ties if you would like to hang these on a bicycle or backpack. That has worked well for us. Each bank holds a decent amount of charge. My son has had a few re-charges for his phone and wireless earbuds along with more power for some USB ring lights we used outdoors a few times.<br /><br />There's a bumper all the way around the bank, so these are great for outdoors. It's always good to bring more power with you than you might think you need, just the same as water. The flashlight is a thoughtful touch.<br /><br />This would be a great gift for anyone active outdoors and teens.<br /><br />Thanks so much for reading my review.

You can set the easel back to any position that works using the side button (on the top of the easel - left hand side).  It is a flat black in color. The only other thing I could say about it is that is fairly heavy.  I had a pouch from something else and I drop into that to carry about.

5.0,Works with my Galaxy Note 3,"Sid Nuncius excellent and very helpful review of December 12, 2013 covers most of the key points and I do not want to repeat them. My review is based on prior experience with sports armbands and I will focus on that comparison.<br /><br />I received a review sample and had a ready point of comparison: a [[ASIN:B00F8HJM36 Mobile Maiden XXL Smartphone Workout Armband]]. That band had a few limitations for newer phones, but this one takes the design of a sports armband to a whole new level.<br /><br />First, this works with the larger phones. My Samsung Galaxy Note 3 fit, as did my Note 2. If you have a smaller phone, though, it may actually get a little lost in the ample pouch. Physically the inside dimensions of the pouch are 7.75 by 3,75 inches (although the top has slightly rounded corners that will take off about an eight of an inch.) Until someone comes out with a phone larger than the Note 3 this is the pouch to get for large smartphones.<br /><br />Second, the armband is heavy duty in every way: the thick, clear face will protect the phone while allowing you to still use your fingers to control all screen functions, and the padded arm strap and case construction are a giant leap over the Mobile Maiden armband to which I am comparing this one. Sound quality is superb even in the heavy case, and the protection that the design affords makes this perfect for strenuous activities. Having your phone enclosed in a zippered case versus one that has a slot to insert your phone is another level of protection that earns this one five stars in my opinion.<br /><br />The bottom line is this is perfect for large smartphones up to the biggest on the market at the time of this review. The protection is the best I have come across and it's comfortable to wear. Do heed my caveat about using this will small smartphones because those may actually flop around inside the pouch.",2014-01-06 18:32:46,74,False,work galaxy note 3,sid nuncius excellent helpful review december 12 2013 cover key point want repeat review based prior experience sport armband focus comparisonbr br received review sample ready point comparison asinb00f8hjm36 mobile maiden xxl smartphone workout armband band limitation newer phone one take design sport armband whole new levelbr br first work larger phone samsung galaxy note 3 fit note 2 smaller phone though may actually get little lost ample pouch physically inside dimension pouch 775 375 inch although top slightly rounded corner take eight inch someone come phone larger note 3 pouch get large smartphonesbr br second armband heavy duty every way thick clear face protect phone allowing still use finger control screen function padded arm strap case construction giant leap mobile maiden armband comparing one sound quality superb even heavy case protection design affords make perfect strenuous activity phone enclosed zippered case versus one slot insert phone another level protection earns one five star opinionbr br bottom line perfect large smartphones biggest market time review protection best come across comfortable wear heed caveat using small smartphones may actually flop around inside pouch,work galaxy note 3 sid nuncius excellent helpful review december 12 2013 cover key point want repeat review based prior experience sport armband focus comparisonbr br received review sample ready point comparison asinb00f8hjm36 mobile maiden xxl smartphone workout armband band limitation newer phone one take design sport armband whole new levelbr br first work larger phone samsung galaxy note 3 fit note 2 smaller phone though may actually get little lost ample pouch physically inside dimension pouch 775 375 inch although top slightly rounded corner take eight inch someone come phone larger note 3 pouch get large smartphonesbr br second armband heavy duty every way thick clear face protect phone allowing still use finger control screen function padded arm strap case construction giant leap mobile maiden armband comparing one sound quality superb even heavy case protection design affords make perfect strenuous activity phone enclosed zippered case versus one slot insert phone another level protection earns one five star opinionbr br bottom line perfect large smartphones biggest market time review protection best come across comfortable wear heed caveat using small smartphones may actually flop around inside pouch,positive,2014,Phone Case

2.0,USABLE WITH CAVEATS! YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU GET!,"I have had the pan for about 5 months now. I find that it takes a noticeable time to heat up and once it does the cooking surface becomes convex and all the liquids float to the edges. There is a definite hot spot in the center that will actually burn anything that touches the area requiring careful attention while your cooking. If the handles are too close to the heating element or flame they get very hot! Be careful! Just a few minor scratches in the coating so far. Yes, easy clean up of most everything I cook in it. I always use plastic or rubber utensils with it and rarely need to wash it with other than a soft sponge. I also never heated it on ""High"" and most always cooked at medium heat. Because of the handles and the convex cooking surface when hot I would not buy this again. I chose this in favor of a more expensive heavier pan with lid that probably had one maybe two more coatings of the non-stick surface on it. Most of these pans last about 2-3 years before their scratches make them unhealthy to cook in anymore. It's just a fact of non-stick cookware. In general non-stick cookware  prices vary by thickness and type of metal and how many coatings are on it. There can be as little as 2 and as much as 5 coatings but unfortunately that doesn't really extend the life of the surface very much. A more expensive pan would be less likely to warp, probably heat more evenly and the handle or handles would remain cool. My last large pan like this was made in Sweden. It was much heavier and cooked very well but the surface only lasted about 3-4 years even with the best of care. It seems it's the nature of the beast.",2019-11-14 01:39:45,0,True,usable caveat pay get,pan 5 month find take noticeable time heat cooking surface becomes convex liquid float edge definite hot spot center actually burn anything touch area requiring careful attention cooking handle close heating element flame get hot careful minor scratch coating far yes easy clean everything cook always use plastic rubber utensil rarely need wash soft sponge also never heated high always cooked medium heat handle convex cooking surface hot would buy chose favor expensive heavier pan lid probably one maybe two coating nonstick surface pan last 23 year scratch make unhealthy cook anymore fact nonstick cookware general nonstick cookware price vary thickness type metal many coating little 2 much 5 coating unfortunately doesnt really extend life surface much expensive pan would less likely warp probably heat evenly handle handle would remain cool last large pan like made sweden much heavier cooked well surface lasted 34 year even best care seems nature beast,usable caveat pay get pan 5 month find take noticeable time heat cooking surface becomes convex liquid float edge definite hot spot center actually burn anything touch area requiring careful attention cooking handle close heating element flame get hot careful minor scratch coating far yes easy clean everything cook always use plastic rubber utensil rarely need wash soft sponge also never heated high always cooked medium heat handle convex cooking surface hot would buy chose favor expensive heavier pan lid probably one maybe two coating nonstick surface pan last 23 year scratch make unhealthy cook anymore fact nonstick cookware general nonstick cookware price vary thickness type metal many coating little 2 much 5 coating unfortunately doesnt really extend life surface much expensive pan would less likely warp probably heat evenly handle handle would remain cool last large pan like made sweden much heavier cooked well surface lasted 34 year even best care seems nature beast,positive,2019,Screen Protector

The one thing Blackberry does better than anyone else out there is conservation of battery power with their devices.

The trade off is insane power consumption, so finding a spare battery & charging dock was one of the first things I did when I made the switch.

I find I can run through an entire charge in less than 8 hours of steady use some days - email, music, audio books, calls and the like. Having a second fully charged battery ready to go is a must!

5.0,Updated Still An Excellent Value For Price,"After searching for cup holder phone mounts, and seeing the outrageous prices others were charging, I ordered this product.  Setup was simple, functions as advertised.<br />I would recommend this product.<br /><br />Update:<br />On June 9, 2021, I purchased this cup holder.  For a year, I was completely satisfied with my purchase.  Just shy of one year, I needed a replacement for this item.  I contacted LorimaDirect and began a wonderful experience with a member of the company.  In less than a day, I received word that that I would receive a replacement free of charge.  That was on June 2, 2022.  I am happy to report that I received the replacement item on June 5, 2022.<br />That is blazing fast.  Three days from request to receiving the item!<br /><br />Lorima represents the BEST in customer service.  I was updated regularly on the progress of the replacement, and not by an auto-generated email, but by a real person.<br /><br />The replacement item has improved some of the features, making it even more durable and sturdy than it was.<br />I would strongly encourage that everyone READ THE INSTRUCTIONS!<br />It was only after receiving the replacement item that I realized that in order to fasten the actual phone holder plate to the unit that it needs to be snapped on and pushed down in order to lock it and prevent it from falling off the unit.<br />Secondly, I never realized that the bottom wing of the phone holder plate (where the USB cable goes through) is actually adjustable via a button on the back side of this plate.<br />Both of these features were available on my old unit, which I still have.  It is my own fault for not having read the instructions completely.<br /><br />I have to disagree with the majority of the negative reviews.  With the exception of those who received a defective unit, I believe that most, if not all the issues encountered could be remedied by either:<br />1) remembering to READ THE INSTRUCTIONS, and/or<br />2) contacting customer service<br /><br />I am completely satisfied with the product.  It has all the features of those marketed by the larger companies, but for a very reasonable price.  I compared this item to those from other, larger companies prior to purchasing from LorimaDirect.  In my opinion, there is no reason to pay upwards of $60 or more for a cupholder from another company, when for substantially less, you get the same product with the same features.<br /><br />Definitely 5 STARS ALL AROUND !!!",2021-09-26 13:30:18,3,True,updated still excellent value price,searching cup holder phone mount seeing outrageous price others charging ordered product setup simple function advertisedbr would recommend productbr br updatebr june 9 2021 purchased cup holder year completely satisfied purchase shy one year needed replacement item contacted lorimadirect began wonderful experience member company less day received word would receive replacement free charge june 2 2022 happy report received replacement item june 5 2022br blazing fast three day request receiving itembr br lorima represents best customer service updated regularly progress replacement autogenerated email real personbr br replacement item improved feature making even durable sturdy wasbr would strongly encourage everyone read instructionsbr receiving replacement item realized order fasten actual phone holder plate unit need snapped pushed order lock prevent falling unitbr secondly never realized bottom wing phone holder plate usb cable go actually adjustable via button back side platebr feature available old unit still fault read instruction completelybr br disagree majority negative review exception received defective unit believe issue encountered could remedied eitherbr 1 remembering read instruction andorbr 2 contacting customer servicebr br completely satisfied product feature marketed larger company reasonable price compared item larger company prior purchasing lorimadirect opinion reason pay upwards 60 cupholder another company substantially less get product featuresbr br definitely 5 star around,updated still excellent value price searching cup holder phone mount seeing outrageous price others charging ordered product setup simple function advertisedbr would recommend productbr br updatebr june 9 2021 purchased cup holder year completely satisfied purchase shy one year needed replacement item contacted lorimadirect began wonderful experience member company less day received word would receive replacement free charge june 2 2022 happy report received replacement item june 5 2022br blazing fast three day request receiving itembr br lorima represents best customer service updated regularly progress replacement autogenerated email real personbr br replacement item improved feature making even durable sturdy wasbr would strongly encourage everyone read instructionsbr receiving replacement item realized order fasten actual phone holder plate unit need snapped pushed order lock prevent falling unitbr secondly never realized bottom wing phone holder plate usb cable go actually adjustable via button back side platebr feature available old unit still fault read instruction completelybr br disagree majority negative review exception received defective unit believe issue encountered could remedied eitherbr 1 remembering read instruction andorbr 2 contacting customer servicebr br completely satisfied product feature marketed larger company reasonable price compared item larger company prior purchasing lorimadirect opinion reason pay upwards 60 cupholder another company substantially less get product featuresbr br definitely 5 star around,positive,2021,Phone Holder

5.0,Best I’ve ever used- and I’ve owned plenty!!,"One of the best I’ve seen! As a mom of x4, Im somehow expected to boost batteries like magic when devices runs low- and with this powerful demon.. I can do it!! This solid option holds a charge even when not in use. Battery won’t deplete just on its own- all bc it has on/off switch!<br /><br />LED screen gives real time accuracy so, it’s easy to know if/when juice is running low and time to recharge unit. WoW..!! Talk about rapid time- refilled my low battery (10% left.) in approx. 1hr. I’ve NeVeR seen a faster boost at work! (I have old fashion iPhone 8+..!!)<br /><br />Clever built in port and cord options (usb/c port)- no prob. if caught without or with the wrong one. A perk cords attach and store tightly into booster itself. NOTE: cord is short (see photos I included) so, it’s not the easiest to use/charge device at same time due to shorter length and angle. **Careful with cord itself.. it’s a “one and done” with these!! IF cord is damaged or breaks- it can’t be replaced (and we all know.. cords see plenty of wear and tear..) Deep breath: you CAN still use boost with your own cord- you just lose “all inclusive convenience.”<br /><br />Built robust-device is durable + protected. Fits standard pant pocket or into a purse/backpack with ease. *Only thing I wasn’t expecting was its weight!! My one issue with it yet, willing to overlook bc of its outstanding performance. This is small and mighty but, hefty! (small as it is- still tugs down on pant pocket by just weight alone.. something to be aware of!)<br /><br />Investing in one a substantial booster will far outlast others and perform beyond expectations.

Fortunately, if you have an iPhone, you can plug in a USB-C to lightning cable to get 18w charging.<br /><br />My favorite thing about the battery is that it can wirelessly charge an Apple Watch (I have a Series 6).

3.0,comfortable design but not my first choice for a headset,"The Jabra Steel Bluetooth headset. For purposes of this review, I used this headset with my iPhone 6s.<br /><br /> Pros: It has a rugged design, but is light weight and extremely comfortable to wear. In the box you receive the headset, 2 wind socks, 2 spare rubber ear pieces, a spare ear clip, and a charging cord. The headset stayed in place well, even while doing some light manual labor. Incoming sound was clear and easy to understand. The controls are simple to work.<br /><br /> Cons: Outgoing transmissions sound tinny and have a slight echo to the person on the other end of the call. The battery life is short. If used moderately heavy, it will not last an 8 hour work day. The charging cord is very short. You have to download and install an App on your phone in order to use this headset. It is the first time I have seen that. The App also contains a locator feature to find your headset and digital manuals.<br /><br /> Summary: While this headset is very comfortable to wear and sounds good on my end, it may not be good for those with whom you are talking. The short battery life means you will have to charge it mid day. Having to use space on the phone for a separate App to use the device is also a downer for me.

4.0,Served(ing) me well,"I bought this phone a little more than a year ago off of a popular internet auction site that shall remain nameless. As occasionally happens there, I got an uncommunicative seller who shipped in very very poor packaging ending with me with a loose phone/battery and box in another box but the phone appear(s)ed to be working okay.<br /><br />I bought this phone as a locked AT&T phone but had already done my homework/pricing to unlock it. As I use Consumer Cellular it did not really need to be unlocked to work with their network but I went ahead and purchased an unlock code and did it myself successfully. Please note unlocking is not the same as rooting. How I wish I could root this phone! It is not easy to do, and I even paid some folks for fixes and got my money back after they failed. So, unlock can be done. I have done it. Rooting is very difficult and should only be attempted by professional in the field.  I did need consumer cellular help to get it to hook up with their APN so I could get data. Took a few calls but I am OK.  Would hate to think what just another brand unlocked phone would be like to get going since technically, CC uses AT&T it should not have been this difficult.<br /><br />I bought this to wean off of a Blackberry. I had tried some waawee huawei whatever smartphone and hated the onscreen keyboard with a passion and the fact it was a little piece of junk.  I didn't have much faith in RIM and BB continuing but still wanted a physical keyboard so this fit the bill.  I agree that while the pull out keyboard is nice, it is not really that easy to type on.  Gradually over the year I have been using the onscreen misery more just because that has the autocorrect. It is a nice option to have a real keyboard so enjoy while you can.<br /><br />Besides the issue with getting this phone to accept another APN (even though it was unlocked) the Samsung issues are as follows:<br /><br />1) Yes the battery life sucks.  Sometimes if I come home and forget to hook it to power for overnight it is dead dead dead in the morning.  Just resign yourself to giving it a good charge at the minimum once a day/night.<br /><br />2) GPS flaw.  Two issues there actually.  One is the darn thing won't lock and will just drain your battery when you turn it on for an app that requires it. It requires a reboot for the GPS to lock if the phone has not been rebooted in a day or two. Second is it is so bad it can just overheat/shutdown the phone even if it did lock.<br /><br />3) External memory micro SD problem. This is reportedly an issue with a) all androids or b) all samsungs or c) counterfeit cards. Pick one.  I replaced the teeny 2GB that came with my Glide with a Kingston 32GB class 4 card. I had issues with the apps that were moved to SD disappearing but nothing a reboot or reinstall of app would not fix until yesterday when the phone got hot as the surface of the sun and gave me the dire message of damaged SD card after I rebooted to get the GPS working (yes, do not depend on this phone in a pinch, please don't).<br /><br />The card is dead as in doornail not recognized by this or any device or able to hold formatting. Getting warranty replacement on the card but beware if you want to upgrade.  I have no advice after reading so many conflicting accounts about just what is the problem with Android or Samsung and external cards. Apparently these days it is no longer common to even have capability for an external card on a droid so leads me to believe it is an OS thing.<br /><br />As a phone.  Call quality is less than stellar if you ask me.  But I am mostly in marginal areas and have not had an issue in fantastic signal areas.<br /><br />Data - accept that in good signal areas with hyperband whathave you when it will forget it is unlocked it seems to be fine.  If it forgets it is unlocked in some special AT&T service area it requires turning data on/off again to do the other APN thing again.<br /><br />Camera - very nice.  Haven't used the front much, I don't want to see me any more than anybody else would want to.<br /><br />You can see here this phone has required me to do more technical stuff than I care to. It is nice to have a keyboard, camera is very good and it has not dropped dead on me so giving it four stars rather than three.",2014-05-21 13:53:44,0,False,serveding well,bought phone little year ago

5.0,Decent Budget Case for iPhone 13,"I selected this case for a new iPhone 13. I wanted a case that fit snugly and that provided decent protection for my phone. So far I'm pleased with it.<br /><br />This is a very simple case, providing basic protection. It has softer bumpers on the sides to protect against corner drops and the back is more rigid. While the sides are clear, the back is frosted which softens the appearance of the phone though the Apple logo is still plainly visible and discernable.<br /><br />The case is a very snug fit. It requires a bit of effort to get the phone to snap into it, and once in there's little play between the edges of the case and the phone. This is not a case where the phone will slip out of the case in your pocket and there will be appreciably less dirt in the case as compared to more relaxed-fit cases.<br /><br />The jury is out on how much protection it provides, but it seems to be decent, particularly for the cost.

5.0,"Looks Good, Made Well and Protects the Phone","I recently gave up my previous smartphone for an iPhone 6s. The unfortunate part of swapping phones is that it means accessories that worked with the old phone do not necessarily work for the new one. A prime example of this is whatever case you have for the old phone – unless you get the same make and model, the likelihood of the case fitting the new phone is very small at best. This case is one of the available choices for the iPhone 6/6s and I have always favored wallet cases. I have not had it long but so far I am very pleased with it. It looks great, it seems to be made well and it definitely protects my phone.<br /><br />This is a folio style of case, a type that I especially favor as I like the added protection against scratches and gouges that the flap provides for the screen. On the inside of the flap are three credit card pockets and a place for bills though the pocket for bills is not long enough to accommodate cash without folding the money (this is a function of the size of the phone, not a problem with the case). I should mention that this kind of case does add a lot of bulk to the phone in terms of the thickness.<br /><br />I have been trying to figure out what kind of material was used to make this case. There is a leather border around the edges, but the main piece of material is something else, almost like a pressed vinyl or waxed canvas? Is it not clear, but it is a tough material that looks good and provides some padding as well as protection.<br /><br />I snapped my phone into the case and it is a very tight fit. So, I know I do not need to worry about my phone slipping out at an inopportune time. The hard plastic holder provides access to all of the important ports, outputs and buttons, though the button covers are a touch stiff and hard to push – not enough to hinder operation, but definitely more effort is required than when using the buttons directly. The charging/sync cable plugs in without obstruction, but plugging in a 3.5mm headphone jack requires some effort as the case does make connecting headphones with all but the smallest plugs a little more difficult due to how close the plastic molding is to the edge of the port. To me this is a small price to pay.<br /><br />The plastic holder is reinforced on the corners and provides some drop protection. I have seen folio cases that offer little reinforcement there which is ok for short drops as the leather portion of the case does provide a limited amount of protection. It is a small detail but it is important – the extra protection can mean the difference between a cracked screen and a phone with no damage.<br /><br />Many cases do not come with an actual screen protector. This one does. It is a plastic sheet cover for the screen, which for a case like this is fine if you plan to keep it in the case most of the time. If you plan to take it out of the case or use your phone with half-shell cases too, you might instead consider getting a tempered glass screen protector as well.<br /><br />I had my phone in my pocket and went to a local pumpkin farm and spent some time in the barn there. There was dust everywhere and it was hard to breathe. When I left the barn I dug out my phone, and the case had kept is mostly free of dust and debris. That's about all I could ask.<br /><br />I really like this case. It looks good and it protects my phone. It's not really very expensive either. If you like folio cases and you have an iPhone 6/6s, this is a good case that's worth a look.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Wow!  The BEST Stylus Pen I’ve Seen!,"As someone who spends a lot of my time in front of a screen working on graphic design or writing I’ve used many stylus pens but this one really is better than any of the others I’ve used.<br /><br />There are many Stylus pens that have a pen on one side and the stylus on the other - this pen is so much more than that.<br /><br />This pen has four distinct tips built into the one unit - each end has a cap with a tip and then beneath those are the other tips.  In addition to that, this set comes complete with a vinyl carrying case and replacement tips for each of the four tips.<br /><br />The Stylus tips are INCREDIBLE.  As someone who does a fair amount of graphic design using a touch screen I have used more Stylus pens than I can remember - this one performs just as well as those that I’ve spent ten times as much on.<br /><br />At first appearance it may seem all Stylus tips are about the same - that is not the case.<br /><br />The basic rubber stylus nub is the perfect density - not giving too much where it flattens and makes too much contact with the screen allowing adequate control.<br /><br />The metal mesh tip is excellent for blending, color editing / correction and general image manipulation within graphic programs.<br /><br />The clear disc tip is AWESOME.  I’ve only used one other Stylus with this tip design and I LOVE it!  The clear disc allows you to look from the side to see exactly when the tiny stylus tip is making contact.  This is ideal for any fine detail work.<br /><br />Finally, the ball point pen tip is handy when you have to sign something or jot a note onto real paper.<br /><br />This is an incredible multi-use Stylus that, if you spend much time working on any touch screen - you will love.  In addition, this would make an awesome gift for any graduate, graphic designer or photographer who does photo editing.<br /><br />I absolutely love this product and highly recommend it.<br /><br />⭐️As with all Drew’s Reviews, if I discover something new about this product - good or bad - I will UPDATE my review.

4.0,"Holds the Note tightly, feels solid in the hand","I needed a clip on case to secure my new Galaxy Note to my waistband or inside a pocket while working out at the barn, but I did not want one that was terribly bulky or would interfer with one handed use. Primarily my interest is in keeping my phone from falling into a water bucket etc while I'm working and being able to listen to podcasts or music while working.<br /><br />This case is thin and easily allows access to both the sleep button and the volume and doesn't impede your ability to use the touchscreen or home buttons and it doesn't poke your cheek when you make a call with it on the phone. The case fits very snugly around the phone and then you slide the phone with the case on into the second part that has the spring clip. I seriously doubt the phone could ever fall out of this case! My ONLY complaint is that if you put the phone into the clip piece in one direction you cannot access the earphone jack and if you flip it over to use your earphones, you cannot have it attached to a charger while in the case. One the belt clip piece is attached you also lose access to your camera - again, if you flip the phone around and put it with the screen facing inside & the camera lense facing outside, you cannot interact with the phone. That is the only reaason for the single star deduction. On the plus side, this case will work nicely at the barn or out walking the dogs and that's all that you really need for less than $10.",2012-09-11 02:32:57,2,True,hold note tightly feel solid hand,needed clip case secure new galaxy note waistband inside pocket working barn want one terribly bulky would interfer one handed use primarily interest keeping phone falling water bucket etc im working able listen podcasts music workingbr br case thin easily allows access sleep button volume doesnt impede ability use touchscreen home button doesnt poke cheek make call phone case fit snugly around phone slide phone case second part spring clip seriously doubt phone could ever fall case complaint put phone clip piece one direction access earphone jack flip use earphone attached charger case one belt clip piece attached also lose access camera flip phone around put screen facing inside camera lense facing outside interact phone reaason single star deduction plus side case work nicely barn walking dog thats really need less 10,hold note tightly feel solid hand needed clip case secure new galaxy note waistband inside pocket working barn want one terribly bulky would interfer one handed use primarily interest keeping phone falling water bucket etc im working able listen podcasts music workingbr br case thin easily allows access sleep button volume doesnt impede ability use touchscreen home button doesnt poke cheek make call phone case fit snugly around phone slide phone case second part spring clip seriously doubt phone could ever fall case complaint put phone clip piece one direction access earphone jack flip use earphone attached charger case one belt clip piece attached also lose access camera flip phone around put screen facing inside camera lense facing outside interact phone reaason single star deduction plus side case work nicely barn walking dog thats really need less 10,positive,2012,Phone Case

4.0,"A Slim, Elegant Stylus, But Less Responsive Than Other Styluses","Capacitive styluses are not all alike.  Besides color, there are subtle differences in sensitivity, length, barrel size, weight, and attachment clips or lanyards.  This BoxWave stylus, which is 4-7/8"" long (exclusive of the capacitive tip) is disappointing, because it doesn't perform nearly as well as the excellent, shorter [[ASIN:B0008G3ID2 BoxWave Capacitive Kindle Fire Stylus]].<br /><br />Compared to other styluses that I tested, this BoxWave stylus is the longest, has the slimmest barrel, and is lightest in weight.  I loved its elegant, slender appearance, but found that holding such a thin barrel made my hand ache after a while.  Also, the slimmer barrel, and the correspondingly smaller capacitive tip, may explain why this stylus isn't as sensitive or responsive as other  styluses.  Frequently I had to tap the touchscreen more than once, or press down harder on the touchscreen to get a response.  The small tip is good for accuracy in selecting small targets (e.g., links displayed in web browsers in tiny fonts), but accuracy doesn't matter if a light touch won't register.  The extra length is a plus, if you hold a stylus like a pointer (away from the tip), rather than like a pencil (close to the tip).<br /><br />For attaching to other things, this stylus has a pocket clip, a lanyard with a plastic end that can be plugged into an earphones outlet, and a great lobster-claw (necklace-type) fastener with jump ring that opens to detach the lanyard.  Besides this stylus, I tested the [[ASIN:B005O2URES MiniSuit Universal Capacitive Stylus Pen]], the [[ASIN:B0008G3ID2 BoxWave Capacitive Kindle Fire Stylus]], the [[ASIN:B004JU1MNG Targus Stylus for Apple iPad]], and the [[ASIN:B004GCJEZU AmazonBasics Stylus for Touchscreen Devices]].  My favorite is the AmazonBasics Stylus, because of its 4-1/4"" length, slim barrel, light weight, and excellent sensitivity; the shorter BoxWave stylus is a close second.  I rate this stylus at 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 stars (""I like it""),  because it is so attractive.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, as I was, what a ""capacitive"" stylus is, it is a human interface device (e.g., a mouse) that uses ""capacitive sensing"" to measure changes of position on a touchscreen.  It works just like a human finger on a touchscreen device, and you can often get more accurate navigation using a stylus.

4.0,A great case for usability and superior protection.,"This is a very robust case - complete with screen cover - that does add a lot of bulk to your phone. I found the size comforting after a while, and have a large enough space in my purse that the extra size didn't hinder me at all. The screen cover took some getting used to, but I found it very responsive and hardly noticed it after a while. I am _not_ a fan of port covers on cases, so simply took some scissors and cut the covers off at the joint (you couldn't even tell they had been there). I will say that getting the case on/off requires some patience - I was sure I was going to break the case or the latches at some point. And I don't use the included holster at all. Finally, while the mint & polka dot design is really cute, after a while (3 months?) all the edges showed dirt & grime. With it being a rubbery material, I haven't found a good way to get that clean and looking new again. Overall, a great case for usability and superior protection.",2017-04-03 21:42:24,0,False,great case usability superior protection,robust case complete screen cover add lot bulk phone found size comforting large enough space purse extra size didnt hinder screen cover took getting used found responsive hardly noticed _not_ fan port cover case simply took scissors cut cover joint couldnt even tell say getting case onoff requires patience sure going break case latch point dont use included holster finally mint polka dot design really cute 3 month edge showed dirt grime rubbery material havent found good way get clean looking new overall great case usability superior protection,great case usability superior protection robust case complete screen cover add lot bulk phone found size comforting large enough space purse extra size didnt hinder screen cover took getting used found responsive hardly noticed _not_ fan port cover case simply took scissors cut cover joint couldnt even tell say getting case onoff requires patience sure going break case latch point dont use included holster finally mint polka dot design really cute 3 month edge showed dirt grime rubbery material havent found good way get clean looking new overall great case usability superior protection,positive,2017,Phone Case

5.0,Great buy,I just got an iphone 11 and realized I needed a new cover and scrambled to find one that wasn't too expensive. I normally opt for Otterbox but the pricing seemed to increase recently and this one popped up as a related item in the search. I decided to give it a try and worst case I could return it.<br /><br />I am very please with the purchase. It is a one piece case (some have a hard portion and a soft silicone portion to attach). This case fits like a glove and all of the buttons work perfect. It is not bulky which is nice since the 11 is a longer/larger phone that I didn't want issues with keeping it in my pocket. The slim fit definitely helps this issue.<br /><br />As far as the grip the back side and all around the backside corners seems to be more of a dense plastic whereas the sides soften up slightly with more of a silicone feel. This is fantastic because it definitely has helped with it already falling on tile floor once as it hit in the corner and fell face down. I dreaded picking it up thinking I would already need a new screen. No marks at all on the case and the screen is intact with no damage!,2021-12-07 14:32:08,0,True,great buy,got iphone 11 realized needed new cover scrambled find one wasnt expensive normally opt otterbox pricing seemed increase recently one popped related item search decided give try worst case could return itbr br please purchase one piece case hard portion soft silicone portion attach case fit like glove button work perfect bulky nice since 11 longerlarger phone didnt want issue keeping pocket slim fit definitely help issuebr br far grip back side around backside corner seems dense plastic whereas side soften slightly silicone feel fantastic definitely helped already falling tile floor hit corner fell face dreaded picking thinking would already need new screen mark case screen intact damage,great buy got iphone 11 realized needed new cover scrambled find one wasnt expensive normally opt otterbox pricing seemed increase recently one popped related item search decided give try worst case could return itbr br please purchase one piece case hard portion soft silicone portion attach case fit like glove button work perfect bulky nice since 11 longerlarger phone didnt want issue keeping pocket slim fit definitely help issuebr br far grip back side around backside corner seems dense plastic whereas side soften slightly silicone feel fantastic definitely helped already falling tile floor hit corner fell face dreaded picking thinking would already need new screen mark case screen intact damage,positive,2021,Phone Case

It is perfect for putting in the backpack and plug into the USB ports that are showing up in most business class hotels now.  It matches the other four cords perfect and actually due to a little cap that makes the cable into a little loop, it is actually even better than the others.<br /><br />Price is good and as long as they live up to the quality they appear to have, I highly recommend these cables.

5.0,Feather light protection,"I received a review sample and at first wondered why this was even a product. However, after snapping an iPhone 5S into it the value became immediately apparent.<br /><br />This case is slightly raised to protect the screen if you drop your phone on a flat, hard surface, so that is one level of protection that fits a value proposition of an inexpensive, minimalist case that is functional. Note that if dropped on uneven surfaces, or worse, stones, neither this nor many other cases on the market are going to be of much use.<br /><br />The material from which this case is constructed is interesting in that it's rigid enough to protect against hard surfaces and objects, but is also pliable and capable of absorbing (or at least mitigating) shocks from short distance drops.<br /><br />Another factor is the precision cutouts for your phone's buttons, camera lens and flash. Everything fits as though this was an integral part of the phone itself.<br /><br />Add in the fact that this is truly feather light and unobtrusive and you have the best of both worlds: nearly invisible protection that actually works.  The only thing that would make this an even better value is if the manufacturer finds a way to include a screen protector without raising the price point. However, as is, this is a great value in my opinion.",2014-01-15 02:40:14,0,False,feather light protection,received review sample first wondered even product however snapping iphone 5 value became immediately apparentbr br case slightly raised protect screen drop phone flat hard surface one level protection fit value proposition inexpensive minimalist case functional note dropped uneven surface worse stone neither many case market going much usebr br material case constructed interesting rigid enough protect hard surface object also pliable capable absorbing least mitigating shock short distance dropsbr br another factor precision cutout phone button camera lens flash everything fit though integral part phone itselfbr br add fact truly feather light unobtrusive best world nearly invisible protection actually work thing would make even better value manufacturer find way include screen protector without raising price point however great value opinion,feather light protection received review sample first wondered even product however snapping iphone 5 value became immediately apparentbr br case slightly raised protect screen drop phone flat hard surface one level protection fit value proposition inexpensive minimalist case functional note dropped uneven surface worse stone neither many case market going much usebr br material case constructed interesting rigid enough protect hard surface object also pliable capable absorbing least mitigating shock short distance dropsbr br another factor precision cutout phone button camera lens flash everything fit though integral part phone itselfbr br add fact truly feather light unobtrusive best world nearly invisible protection actually work thing would make even better value manufacturer find way include screen protector without raising price point however great value opinion,positive,2014,Phone Case

4.0,"The new ""Little Mermaid""","From Hayao Miyazaki, the master of Japanese animation, comes a story similar to The Little Mermaid, where a small and ever-so-cute fish-like female becomes infatuated with a land dwelling male, and moves heaven and earth, and a lot of ocean to try to make her dream come true.<br /><br />Short attention span summary (SASS):<br /><br />1. Fish girl lives with her father and siblings in an aquarium-like home inside a really cool submarine with flippers.<br />2. Headstrong and clever, she sneaks out to see the surface, and encounters the debris of human civilization, immediately getting into trouble.<br />3. She is rescued by a young boy, and a strong bond is forged between the two.<br />4. Daddy comes to the rescue to save his kidnapped child<br />5. ... but finds that girls just wanna have fun<br />6. Everything goes topsy-turvy until her mother shows up<br /><br />Ponyo is a wonderfully entertaining movie for young children, and although not as strong in plot as Miyazaki's other movies like Princess Mononoke or Howl's Moving Castle, the animation is excellent, and the story will touch your heart.<br /><br />There is no shortage of voice talent, with Noah Cyrus (Miley's little sister) as Ponyo, Frankie (the bonus) Jonas as her friend Sosuke, and also Tina Fey, Matt Damon, Liam Neeson, Cate Blanchett, Cloris Leachman, Betty White and Lily Tomlin.<br /><br />This is one to see with the entire family, but falls just short of perfect with a few too many inexplicable elements.  Recommended for the fantastic animation, simple plot, characters and ecological message, and very strongly recommended for families with young children.<br /><br />Rated: 4.5 stars<br /><br />Amanda Richards, August 15, 2009",2009-08-15 13:02:42,1,False,new little mermaid,hayao miyazaki master japanese animation come story similar little mermaid small eversocute fishlike female becomes infatuated land dwelling male move heaven earth lot ocean try make dream come truebr br short attention span summary sassbr br 1 fish girl life father sibling aquariumlike home inside really cool submarine flippersbr 2 headstrong clever sneak see surface encounter debris human civilization immediately getting troublebr 3 rescued young boy strong bond forged twobr 4 daddy come rescue save kidnapped childbr 5 find girl wan na funbr 6 everything go topsyturvy mother show upbr br ponyo wonderfully entertaining movie young child although strong plot miyazakis movie like princess mononoke howl moving castle animation excellent story touch heartbr br shortage voice talent noah cyrus mileys little sister ponyo frankie bonus jonas friend sosuke also tina fey matt damon liam neeson cate blanchett cloris leachman betty white lily tomlinbr br one see entire family fall short perfect many inexplicable element recommended fantastic animation simple plot character ecological message strongly recommended family young childrenbr br rated 45 starsbr br amanda richards august 15 2009,new little mermaid hayao miyazaki master japanese animation come story similar little mermaid small eversocute fishlike female becomes infatuated land dwelling male move heaven earth lot ocean try make dream come truebr br short attention span summary sassbr br 1 fish girl life father sibling aquariumlike home inside really cool submarine flippersbr 2 headstrong clever sneak see surface encounter debris human civilization immediately getting troublebr 3 rescued young boy strong bond forged twobr 4 daddy come rescue save kidnapped childbr 5 find girl wan na funbr 6 everything go topsyturvy mother show upbr br ponyo wonderfully entertaining movie young child although strong plot miyazakis movie like princess mononoke howl moving castle animation excellent story touch heartbr br shortage voice talent noah cyrus mileys little sister ponyo frankie bonus jonas friend sosuke also tina fey matt damon liam neeson cate blanchett cloris leachman betty white lily tomlinbr br one see entire family fall short perfect many inexplicable element recommended fantastic animation simple plot character ecological message strongly recommended family young childrenbr br rated 45 starsbr br amanda richards august 15 2009,positive,2009,Screen Protector

5.0,Best place to buy these pens! LOVE THEM!,"We have a lot of ""devices"" in our house that need this type of pen.<br />We've tried several other kinds, including much more expensive pens.<br /><br />We originally bought a different set of these from this seller because of the great<br />color combinations. Well, we found out that not only are they great looking, they work<br />better than any of the other capacitive pens that we've tried!<br /><br />This is a repeat purchase for us, getting a different color combination. Again, fabulous results from<br />The Friendly Swede - well packaged, shipped quickly and great pens!<br />When I opened the package, I was immediately swarmed with (older) kids wanting a certain color!<br />(That's fine with me, but there WILL be trouble if anyone takes Mom's green one! I have permanent<br />'dibs' on anything in apple green that enters the house. Ha!)<br /><br />If you are not having as great a response with your touch screen as you might like, check your pen.<br />There are differences in the quality of these pens (although a lot of people sell them now), and they DO<br />wear out. My old pen (from the same seller) did not look that bad, but I noticed that I was having to drag<br />or retouch some things more often. The pen didn't look worn out, but it was getting there. (Using it several<br />times every day for months - go figure that it wore out!) The new pen made an immediate difference.<br /><br />I just don't think you can find a better pen or a better seller. The color combinations available here are<br />beyond compare (and what first caused me to purchase here). Everyone will find something that they like.<br />The seller also offers a big variety of pen SIZES, so if you have very small hands, you want one for a child, or<br />you need a bigger size, you'll find a pen here that will work for you.<br /><br />I'm just so pleased with these. I got six pens for a little less than I paid for ONE pen from another seller.<br />The more expensive pen came in a nice box (which was immediately discarded), but it didn't really do much else.<br />That was why I came back to Amazon to shop for a different pen in the first place.<br />You don't have to shop here, but honestly, why would you want to shop any place else?<br />Yes, I'm a huge fan - when you've never had a bad experience with a seller, you notice!<br /><br />So, add some color to your life, and grab a package of these capacitive pens. They work so well!<br />I wore mine out on my Nook, but my kids use them for the Nook, Fire and of course, their phones.<br /><br />Thank you, The Friendly Swede, for making a great product, and providing outstanding service!",2012-07-20 12:35:49,4,True,best place buy pen love,lot device house need type penbr weve tried several kind including much expensive pensbr br originally bought different set seller greatbr color combination well found great looking workbr better capacitive pen weve triedbr br repeat purchase u getting different color combination fabulous result frombr friendly swede well packaged shipped quickly great pensbr opened package immediately swarmed older kid wanting certain colorbr thats fine trouble anyone take mom green one permanentbr dibs anything apple green enters house habr br great response touch screen might like check penbr difference quality pen although lot people sell dobr wear old pen seller look bad noticed dragbr retouch thing often pen didnt look worn getting using severalbr time every day month go figure wore new pen made immediate differencebr br dont think find better pen better seller color combination available arebr beyond compare first caused purchase everyone find something likebr seller also offer big variety pen size small hand want one child orbr need bigger size youll find pen work youbr br im pleased got six pen little less paid one pen another sellerbr expensive pen came nice box immediately discarded didnt really much elsebr came back amazon shop different pen first placebr dont shop honestly would want shop place elsebr yes im huge fan youve never bad experience seller noticebr br add color life grab package capacitive pen work wellbr wore mine nook kid use nook fire course phonesbr br thank friendly swede making great product providing outstanding service,best place buy pen love lot device house need type penbr weve tried several kind including much expensive pensbr br originally bought different set seller greatbr color combination well found great looking workbr better capacitive pen weve triedbr br repeat purchase u getting different color combination fabulous result frombr friendly swede well packaged shipped quickly great pensbr opened package immediately swarmed older kid wanting certain colorbr thats fine trouble anyone take mom green one permanentbr dibs anything apple green enters house habr br great response touch screen might like check penbr difference quality pen although lot people sell dobr wear old pen seller look bad noticed dragbr retouch thing often pen didnt look worn getting using severalbr time every day month go figure wore new pen made immediate differencebr br dont think find better pen better seller color combination available arebr beyond compare first caused purchase everyone find something likebr seller also offer big variety pen size small hand want one child orbr need bigger size youll find pen work youbr br im pleased got six pen little less paid one pen another sellerbr expensive pen came nice box immediately discarded didnt really much elsebr came back amazon shop different pen first placebr dont shop honestly would want shop place elsebr yes im huge fan youve never bad experience seller noticebr br add color life grab package capacitive pen work wellbr wore mine nook kid use nook fire course phonesbr br thank friendly swede making great product providing outstanding service,positive,2012,Phone Charger

4.0,Good holder for the price,"Really pleased. Well made, convenient little holder especially for price. The neck is very strong and holds its shape extremely well. The clip that holds the phone is on a ball joint and easy to move around, also holds well where you position it.<br /><br />A con is the base clip is weak and slides around easily which makes the whole thing tip over in certain positions, especially if the arm goes off to the side. Clip is definitely strong enough to hold it when aligned better though, but it seems like the clip might break eventually if you adjust the arm by cranking against the base. I hold the bottom of the arm when making big adjustments to the arm or else the clip slides all over or pops off. I've got a metal wood clamp with a spring and I'll probably try to anchor it with that.<br /><br />The only other con is the clamp can press the side buttons on my phone if I'm not careful - there's no way around it because of how the clip works.

4.0,"Another nice product from Peak Design, please watch my video for some tips...","[[VIDEOID:adbc9f8ef3eb02e15527d76ac50c7d05]] THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* Aesthetically, a beautiful wallet/kick stand for magsafe cases, or non-magsafe cases using the PD adapter. You don't even have to buy the PD adapter, you can buy a metal ring that's made for magsafe accessories.<br />* Magnetism is strong, but more on this in the ""bad"" section below.<br />* Using it as a kickstand works very well. Easily pivot the wallet from portrait to landscape. This is actually also a bad point, more on this below.<br />* Peak Design is a reputable company that makes some great stuff.<br />* If your car has a magnetic mount, this wallet will stick to it along with the phone. I discuss this in my video.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Though the magnetism is strong, the wallet is longer than the PD adapter. So the bottom half of the wallet can easily pivot since it's not sticking to anything. So imagine removing the phone and wallet out of your pocket, and the bottom of the wallet brushes against your hip or something, it can pivot and fall off the phone case. So you have to be careful with this. Ironically, this ability to pivot is actually a good thing when it comes to using the wallet as a kickstand. That is how you go from portrait to landscape easily.

3.0,WaterProof Case for iPhone 6; Impacts Usability,"I have looked at a lot of different phone cases for my iPhone 6 and this case is one of the ones I looked at. I was interested in the waterproof aspect of it, but I also was curious to see if it was going to be a solid case that would hold up. I would say it's a good case to a point.<br /><br />This is a full case that completely covers your phone on all sides. It snaps together very stiffly and it is very difficult to pry open again after it has been closed. This is a good sign in that it is not going to accidentally come apart when you need to to stay together most. I am very willing to put up with the tightness in exchange for security for my phone.<br /><br />This is a stiff plastic case and it actually has little flex to it even when it is empty which is good. The plastic is not so hard that I would call it brittle, but it is hard enough that I am curious to see what will happen when it is sufficiently cold and I accidentally drop my phone. I am not sure if the plastic will be brittle when it is cold, though I would hope not.<br /><br />The case has a built-in screen protector and this is a very good feature. I like the fact that there is a screen protector at all, though I would have preferred a tempered glass front instead of just a plastic anti-scratch front. Still, many cases come with no screen protection at all and so I think having the plastic anti-scratch cover is more than most have. Keep in mind that this just protects against scratches and will not help against impact damage.<br /><br />The main feature of this case it waterproofing. In limited testing it does seem to work well in that regard. I am not willing to submit this case (with my phone in it) to a submersion test but I can say it passes a running water test when the ports have been sealed. It likely will be fine in a brief submersion situation though I would get it out of the water as quickly as possible.<br /><br />The waterproofing comes at a price, though. With this particular case, the microphone slot is covered and it interferes with the call. Others with whom I have spoken when my phone is in the case have told me I sound muffled. The plastic screen protector covers the speaker through which you listen as well and there is a very small impact when carrying on a conversation – not enough to interfere, but enough to notice. Also, there is a plastic film over the hole for the camera flash, and it is hard to clean when it gets dirty due to being recessed in the case. This is enough to degrade the effectiveness of said flash.<br /><br />This is not a bad case. It is actually a decent case and it seems to work well for its intended purpose. It does provide good protection for the phone and it is very hard to open once closed, making it very likely to keep the phone secure within. It does interfere with calls, though, and this is something to consider when looking for a waterproof case: it is not easy to get the phone out of the case very quickly, so it might prove a little frustrating when trying to use the phone with this case.<br /><br />Disclosure: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

5.0,Perfect emergent to have- don’t overlook!!,"LOVE the small footprint!! Truly the size of a credit card. Tbh, I was hesitant it could really step up.. and yet, it surpassed all expectations. Owning older iPhone my battery life is less than ideal. But, unwilling to give up my old school 8+ just yet.. I make life work by using a power boost!! I’ve found various sizes of boosts help in diff. scenarios…<br /><br />This boost is ideal for being clutch!! It is “need ready on the go” when you are.. bc it has on/off switch! With this, you can fully charge it and turn off by power switch- then it will store its power till needed.. amazing!! Trust me, not all boost will do this (some begin to drain once unplugged!!) With this booster- I may not need it for days after I fill it up.. Ha! Only when powered on it still has 100% of boost ready to go to work.. The perfect solution to tuck into purse/backpack and have ready when you’re stuck in a bind.<br /><br />So EASY to carry.. along with small size, it weighs nothing! Won’t pull down on pockets like heavy or bulky options.. great for carrying while exercising or just running about! LED lights signal the drain as it transfers from boost to device.. if fully charged- I get approx. 1.5 refills of battery.. enough to keep me out of a tight spot! When charging you will receive a flashing blue light.. this doesn’t read a % as it drains but rather has a 4 tiered light bar that goes down as battery Life is used. When empty it automatically shuts down- letting you know it’s time to refill on the charger. Simple and straightforward!<br /><br />This is a fabulous $10 find- Creates a solid and user-friendly dependable option.. and without any hesitation I’d recommend if looking for a small easy to use/carry battery boost.. this is ideal.

5.0,"Used daily, 21 months later this wallet is still in perfect condition","I bought this wallet nearly two years ago. I use it every day. There hasn't been another wallet that has caught my attention, nor have I needed another one as this one had been near perfect for the entire time I have been using it. It is a sturdy, well constructed wallet that holds more than it needs to and feels secure to use. Cleans easily. Zippers stay shut, the card holders are deep enough to hold cards. The wallet is wide enough to carry cash and checks without folding them. I love the internal coin zip pocket. I can stick a pen, lip gloss, pack of sticky notes, and a few other slim doo-dads in center zipped area. Despite it having the ability to hold a lot of little extras, it is not bulky. At all. I can stick my cell phone in there so long as it doesn't have a thick case (which is why I originally ordered it so many moons ago). Wristlet is secure.<br /><br /> I'm reviewing it now because I am interested in buying a wallet that has a cross body strap. I don't want to use it in that way every time, but occasionally I want to just take my wallet into a store and not an entire purse. But want to emphasize that the wristlet on this wallet is very well made and super sturdy, and works well enough for semi hands free shopping/errand running. Nothing on this wallet has ever made me question the integrity of the materials. It is solid!<br /><br />However, now that I am looking for one with a cross body strap, I am sad to move out of this wallet and into something else. So now I am looking at the exact same company (Belfen/Befen) for something that will be similar to this wallet and yet have a cross body strap. Way to go Belfen/Befen for making something of quality that has made me want to purchase from you again.

5.0,Solid Vent-Based Mounting System,"I go through phone mounts for the car at a rate of about one every year. My preference in mounts is actually vent mounts because the AC coming out of the vent keeps the phone cooler (I have had problems with the phone overheating in the car on occasion and mounting over the vent helps tremendously). I have used other Andobil phone mounts and looked to this one to fill the need since my last mount broke. So far I’m pleased with it.<br /><br />This mount is a typical ball/socket mount for the vent, but there are two different vent attachments for it. One is a typical pincer-type that grips via rubber-padded fins that work somewhat like disk brakes. The other is a type I have never before seen and works by a retractable hook designed to hold tight against the back of the vent fin, without a friction grip.<br /><br />The pincer grip works about as expected. It has a wingnut-style tightener that slowly closes the fins together until they form a good, firm grip on one of the fins in the vent. If you haven’t worked with this type of mount, I offer a word of caution from experience – do not overtighten, because enough tension will cause the fins to crack and break which ruins the mount.<br /><br />The other mount works on a worm gear style of mechanism (if it’s not a worm gear, it works like one). A turning sleeve slowly retracts the hooked arm until it catches and holds snugly against the vent. It has a couple of splayed feet that provide support against either the rest of the vent or the dashboard depending on how it is positioned.<br /><br />From experience with other Andobil mounts, I would recommend putting a drop of lubricating oil on the ball to help prevent the socket from seizing. The rubber gasket in the socket has a tendency to stick to the ball, which is an issue if you want to make an adjustment to the position.<br /><br />The holding bracket for the phone itself is well designed. Some brackets snap open abruptly when opened, but this one opens gently which produces less wear and tear on the inner workings. It accommodates my phone just fine (an older iPhone 6) but it also is large enough to handle larger models without difficulty. The bracket holds securely and I have had no problem with my phone shifting or slipping, even when I have slapped my phone in hastily without paying attention.<br /><br />Overall, this is a nice vent mount for the phone. It holds well and it has a different mounting mechanism that seems to work better than the normal pincer type, though it comes with a pincer mount too if that is preferred. If you like vent mounts for the phone (and in my case, such is my very best option), this is one to consider.",2021-05-08 13:37:53,0,False,solid ventbased mounting system,go phone mount car rate one every year preference mount actually vent mount ac coming vent keep phone cooler problem phone overheating car occasion mounting vent help tremendously used andobil phone mount looked one fill need since last mount broke far im pleased itbr br mount typical ballsocket mount vent two different vent attachment one typical pincertype grip via rubberpadded fin work somewhat like disk brake type never seen work retractable hook designed hold tight back vent fin without friction gripbr br pincer grip work expected wingnutstyle tightener slowly close fin together form good firm grip one fin vent havent worked type mount offer word caution experience overtighten enough tension cause fin crack break ruin mountbr br mount work worm gear style mechanism worm gear work like one turning sleeve slowly retracts hooked arm catch hold snugly vent couple splayed foot provide support either rest vent dashboard depending positionedbr br experience andobil mount would recommend putting drop lubricating oil ball help prevent socket seizing rubber gasket socket tendency stick ball issue want make adjustment positionbr br holding bracket phone well designed bracket snap open abruptly opened one open gently produce less wear tear inner working accommodates phone fine older iphone 6 also large enough handle larger model without difficulty bracket hold securely problem phone shifting slipping even slapped phone hastily without paying attentionbr br overall nice vent mount phone hold well different mounting mechanism seems work better normal pincer type though come pincer mount preferred like vent mount phone case best option one consider,solid ventbased mounting system go phone mount car rate one every year preference mount actually vent mount ac coming vent keep phone cooler problem phone overheating car occasion mounting vent help tremendously used andobil phone mount looked one fill need since last mount broke far im pleased itbr br mount typical ballsocket mount vent two different vent attachment one typical pincertype grip via rubberpadded fin work somewhat like disk brake type never seen work retractable hook designed hold tight back vent fin without friction gripbr br pincer grip work expected wingnutstyle tightener slowly close fin together form good firm grip one fin vent havent worked type mount offer word caution experience overtighten enough tension cause fin crack break ruin mountbr br mount work worm gear style mechanism worm gear work like one turning sleeve slowly retracts hooked arm catch hold snugly vent couple splayed foot provide support either rest vent dashboard depending positionedbr br experience andobil mount would recommend putting drop lubricating oil ball help prevent socket seizing rubber gasket socket tendency stick ball issue want make adjustment positionbr br holding bracket phone well designed bracket snap open abruptly opened one open gently produce less wear tear inner working accommodates phone fine older iphone 6 also large enough handle larger model without difficulty bracket hold securely problem phone shifting slipping even slapped phone hastily without paying attentionbr br overall nice vent mount phone hold well different mounting mechanism seems work better normal pincer type though come pincer mount preferred like vent mount phone case best option one consider,positive,2021,Phone Case
5.0,Great basic case.,"I've been testing this case out for a week and I can say with brutal honesty that Amazon makes some strong competitors with their AmazonBasics line.<br />If you're looking for a ""basic"" case for your iPhone 4 that offers just general protection, this is it.  It's not exactly drop-proof as it is, after all, a thin, soft silicon layer, but it gets the job done.  I have a very similar case ([[ASIN:B003QP423M Amzer Luxe Argyle High Gloss TPU Soft Gel Skin Case for iPhone 4 (Smoke Grey) (Fits AT&T iPhone)]]) that was $3 more when I purchased it, and the AmazonBasics is just as good with the exception of covering the buttons and the Apple logo on back.  I was a bit worried that since it doesn't cover ANY of the buttons it would become a problem, but so far so good.  Only time will tell.<br /><br />The case does have some sharper edges than the Amzer's rounded ones, but it hasn't become a problem yet.  In fact, it actually adds some grip when I play Angry Birds!  I let my father use my phone once and he complained that the case hurt his ear, but I haven't experienced any problems yet myself.<br /><br />AmazonBasics is just that: basic accessories made and sent from Amazon.  If you want a generic case that will save your phone from a small drop, look no further.  If you expect to drop your iPhone from a three-story building without any issues however, then you need a different case.  Or a slap in the face.

5.0,Surprisingly excellent!,"I wasn't expecting much from the pictures, it just looks like a very vanilla TPU case. But in my hands and in person, I really appreciate this case very much. It's actually grippy, like a really rubberized material and feels really good in my hands. It also feels small- even with the case on, it feels like other phones WITHOUT a case  on. That's likely because of how it handles the curved screen- there's no lip because it has to expose the edges.<br />This is a bit of a concern re: durability, but that's the tradeoff to owning a phone with a curved display. The top and bottom of the case DO have a lip, since they are able to over the device edges. That at least offers some durability and protection if face down. Otherwise, all holes/cutouts/etc line up perfectly, it fits like a glove.

4.0,Mostly good,"As of this writing, only the black case was available on Amazon so I purchased the red one direct through Supcase.  I've been loyal to this brand for years and they've protected my devices from what I thought was sure destruction more times than I can remember.<br /><br />This is my first edge case, however, and my first impressions are good, but not great.  The clear back looks sharp but I question its durability.  I also have camera protectors put on and while they fit through the opening, my phone no longer lays flat as it did with the case I had on while waiting for this one to arrive.  Not a deal breaker but I wish the camera protectors, which do not add bulk, were flush to this case's backing.<br /><br />Finally, I had to remove the fingerprint ""dot"" on the inside of the screen protector for two reasons: the first being that it was touch and go with whether or not it worked; secondly (and the ultimate reason I peeled it off) the dot was too visible, impeding my viewing experience.  The dot was completely transparent but its edges let me know it was there at all times, which was very distracting.<br /><br />All in all, I love the frame of the supcases as well as its screen protectors compared to the peel-n-stick ones that come with competitor brands.  I'm going to give this one a try but I may go back to the original style that has nontranspant back plate if I feel this one's durability isn't up to the task.

5.0,Stunning Kate Spade Design Case From Incipio,"This shock-absorbing KATE SPADE NEW YORK COVER FOR THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S7 EDGE (Rose Gold/Cream) is absolutely stunning when added to a gold-colored S7 Edge smartphone.  The reddish gold lightning bands on the hard plastic back add a striking accent, while the clear plastic in between the bands allows the beautiful gold metal of the phone itself to shine through.<br /><br />The clear rubber bumpers around the edges don't detract at all from the curved-edge Galaxy phone display.

5.0,Excellent Case Specifically Made for iPhone 11,"While I try to be careful with my iPhone, life just happens.<br /><br />I’m a multimedia sculptor and since my phone is always with me it ends up being jeopardized in odd and crazy ways.

The Commuter would be better if it came with an optional belt clip like the Defender (because quite honestly the Commuter is still too large for most pants pockets). Also, the Commuter screen protector isn't that great because of the glue.

1.0,Very heavy and takes hours to recharge an iPhoneX,"Not sure if mine is defective but it takes many hours to charge my iPhone X.<br />Note in case it’s not clear from the pictures, you can charge one phone wirelessly but the other two phones need to be plugged in with your own charging cables to the two usb outlets.<br />Instructions say to charge and completely use up the battery of the device at LEAST 3 times with the first charge being plugged into the wall and not via solar.<br />However, when this solar charger gets down to the last battery bar, you’ll notice that when you try to wirelessly charge or charge with the USB port, that it will initially start charging, but within a minute, it will shut off. So beware that it’s not like your phone where you can use it till it’s completely empty. The led lights still work at that point though. It’s been really hard to completely discharge the device because when it’s on its last battery bar, it won’t charge my phone. I’ve been waiting for the device to run out of battery on its own but it’s been two days that it still has one bar left.<br /><br />Main problems:<br />1. POTENTIALLY NOT WATERPROOF: Included Instructions say not to get this wet, even though it’s marketed as water proof. The rubber orange flap that covers the USB ports is very flimsy in that I’m not convinced its a very tight waterproofed seal when closed. I am comparing this to my Olympus waterproof camera and Pelican waterproof phone case, which both have very tight seals for any ports.<br />2. WEIGHT: this thing is half the thickness of a brick and weighs about the same as a brick. It’s not something you’d want to take backpacking or in a purse. It’s more of a for-emergency-situations tool. Instructions recommend you utilize it at least every three months.<br />3. DURATION OF RECHARGE: It takes a long time (like overnight) to recharge itself even when plugged into a wall charger.<br />4. EFFICIENCY: It takes at least twice as long to charge my iPhoneX than my other wireless charging pads at home.",2020-07-27 22:08:34,22,True,heavy take hour recharge iphonex,sure mine defective take many hour charge iphone xbr note case clear picture charge one phone wirelessly two phone need plugged charging cable two usb outletsbr instruction say charge completely use battery device least 3 time first charge plugged wall via solarbr however solar charger get last battery bar youll notice try wirelessly charge charge usb port initially start charging within minute shut beware like phone use till completely empty led light still work point though really hard completely discharge device last battery bar wont charge phone ive waiting device run battery two day still one bar leftbr br main problemsbr 1 potentially waterproof included instruction say get wet even though marketed water proof rubber orange flap cover usb port flimsy im convinced tight waterproofed seal closed comparing olympus waterproof camera pelican waterproof phone case tight seal portsbr 2 weight thing half thickness brick weighs brick something youd want take backpacking purse foremergencysituations tool instruction recommend utilize least every three monthsbr 3 duration recharge take long time like overnight recharge even plugged wall chargerbr 4 efficiency take least twice long charge iphonex wireless charging pad home,heavy take hour recharge iphonex sure mine defective take many hour charge iphone xbr note case clear picture charge one phone wirelessly two phone need plugged charging cable two usb outletsbr instruction say charge completely use battery device least 3 time first charge plugged wall via solarbr however solar charger get last battery bar youll notice try wirelessly charge charge usb port initially start charging within minute shut beware like phone use till completely empty led light still work point though really hard completely discharge device last battery bar wont charge phone ive waiting device run battery two day still one bar leftbr br main problemsbr 1 potentially waterproof included instruction say get wet even though marketed water proof rubber orange flap cover usb port flimsy im convinced tight waterproofed seal closed comparing olympus waterproof camera pelican waterproof phone case tight seal portsbr 2 weight thing half thickness brick weighs brick something youd want take backpacking purse foremergencysituations tool instruction recommend utilize least every three monthsbr 3 duration recharge take long time like overnight recharge even plugged wall chargerbr 4 efficiency take least twice long charge iphonex wireless charging pad home,negative,2020,Phone Battery

She uses it at her job and will hang her phone so she can use with ease.  She's had zero issues with phone falling out or slipping, it will stay where it's out until she peels it off.  The magnetic properties is the beat feature by far in her opinion.  The card holders and other slots are just a small bonus for her.  The cases finish and look is very sleek and nice.  It seems to hold up well with everyday work use and ahes happy with that as well.  I plan on buying myself one in the near future.

5.0,Still cold hours later,"I was not sure if I would like this tumbler because I have always used the acrylic decorative tumblers.  But I recently started drinking protein smoothies or shakes in the morning, and I needed something that would keep the frozen texture for at least a couple of hours.  After only one day of using this product, I can already say I am very happy I made the switch.  I blended my frozen smoothie and poured it into this tumbler at 7 a.m.  When I finally got around to finishing the smoothie at 11 a.m., it was still frozen (I kept finding bits of ice!).  I rinsed it out and put water in at noon, and there was no lingering flavor issue.  The outside of the cup feels cool whenever I have a drink in it, but that does not bother me.  The only negative I've noticed so far is that I cannot use the straw for the smoothie, but the sip style lid works great for that use.  Overall, I would definitely buy this product again.<br /><br />Update (7/15/16): I tried using crushed ice in my water yesterday, but I noticed it melted within a couple of hours.  And I was inside an air conditioned building at the time.  Ice cubes have lasted a few hours longer, but they still melt pretty quickly.  The good news is even if the ice melts I've noticed my water will stay cold enough for me to keep using the cup.  If you are expecting ice to stay in solid form for a full 24 hours, this cup may not be the best option.  On average, I would say the ice does not stay in solid form for more than six hours or so.",2016-07-12 19:15:14,4,True,still cold hour later,sure would like tumbler always used acrylic decorative tumbler recently started drinking protein smoothy shake morning needed something would keep frozen texture least couple hour one day using product already say happy made switch blended frozen smoothie poured tumbler 7 finally got around finishing smoothie 11 still frozen kept finding bit ice rinsed put water noon lingering flavor issue outside cup feel cool whenever drink bother negative ive noticed far use straw smoothie sip style lid work great use overall would definitely buy product againbr br update 71516 tried using crushed ice water yesterday noticed melted within couple hour inside air conditioned building time ice cube lasted hour longer still melt pretty quickly good news even ice melt ive noticed water stay cold enough keep using cup expecting ice stay solid form full 24 hour cup may best option average would say ice stay solid form six hour,still cold hour later sure would like tumbler always used acrylic decorative tumbler recently started drinking protein smoothy shake morning needed something would keep frozen texture least couple hour one day using product already say happy made switch blended frozen smoothie poured tumbler 7 finally got around finishing smoothie 11 still frozen kept finding bit ice rinsed put water noon lingering flavor issue outside cup feel cool whenever drink bother negative ive noticed far use straw smoothie sip style lid work great use overall would definitely buy product againbr br update 71516 tried using crushed ice water yesterday noticed melted within couple hour inside air conditioned building time ice cube lasted hour longer still melt pretty quickly good news even ice melt ive noticed water stay cold enough keep using cup expecting ice stay solid form full 24 hour cup may best option average would say ice stay solid form six hour,positive,2016,Screen Protector

4.0,Very rigid cover; good quality; partially works on earlier Stylo phone,"I ordered this for my LG G Stylo phone, but it was designed for a Stylo 2, which is apparently just slightly different.  It does fit my phone, but it partially covers the camera flash and completely covers the laser detection auto focus. I believe it also covers the headphone jack. All the other holes line up okay (microphone, charging port, speaker and hole for the stylus).  All the front openings are available because this is a one-sided case.  If you don't use the camera that much or the headphone jack (which I don't), you could make it work.  It is very rigid, so it seems as if it would be very durable and long lasting.  Because it is a completely rigid case, it was a little difficult to slip the phone into it and I may have cracked the back cover of the phone (the battery cover).  It's possible that it was already cracked from dropping the phone a few times, but I know I made several of the cracks worse putting it in the case and then removing the case.  When I first removed the case, it pulled the back off the phone, in fact.  Possibly the fit might not be quite as tight on a Stylo 2, but if it was not a good firm fit, the case would not stay in place.  My suggestion - once you have it in the case, don't remove it, unless you have to in order to get to the battery or memory card inside your phone.  The only thing that I really didn't like is that this is a one sided case that covers only the back, ends and side of the phone but not the front.  My current case has a cover, to cover the front of the phone as well, so it protects it much better.  My attempts to fit this case to a phone that it wasn't quite designed for should not impact your decision to buy this case.  All I would say is to just be careful inserting it into the case, so as not to flex the phone at all, which might crack the back phone cover (the battery cover) as it did mine.  I wasn't keen on the pink color, but you can order this in other colors.",2017-11-05 18:13:12,0,False,rigid cover good quality partially work earlier stylo phone,ordered lg g stylo phone designed stylo 2 apparently slightly different fit phone partially cover camera flash completely cover laser detection auto focus believe also cover headphone jack hole line okay microphone charging port speaker hole stylus front opening available onesided case dont use camera much headphone jack dont could make work rigid seems would durable long lasting completely rigid case little difficult slip phone may cracked back cover phone battery cover possible already cracked dropping phone time know made several crack worse putting case removing case first removed case pulled back phone fact possibly fit might quite tight stylo 2 good firm fit case would stay place suggestion case dont remove unless order get battery memory card inside phone thing really didnt like one sided case cover back end side phone front current case cover cover front phone well protects much better attempt fit case phone wasnt quite designed impact decision buy case would say careful inserting case flex phone might crack back phone cover battery cover mine wasnt keen pink color order color,rigid cover good quality partially work earlier stylo phone ordered lg g stylo phone designed stylo 2 apparently slightly different fit phone partially cover camera flash completely cover laser detection auto focus believe also cover headphone jack hole line okay microphone charging port speaker hole stylus front opening available onesided case dont use camera much headphone jack dont could make work rigid seems would durable long lasting completely rigid case little difficult slip phone may cracked back cover phone battery cover possible already cracked dropping phone time know made several crack worse putting case removing case first removed case pulled back phone fact possibly fit might quite tight stylo 2 good firm fit case would stay place suggestion case dont remove unless order get battery memory card inside phone thing really didnt like one sided case cover back end side phone front current case cover cover front phone well protects much better attempt fit case phone wasnt quite designed impact decision buy case would say careful inserting case flex phone might crack back phone cover battery cover mine wasnt keen pink color order color,positive,2017,Phone Case

We got an ""amplifier"" from T-Mobile that was useless.  We set up the antenna as directed (upstairs pointed at the preferred tower using a free app from the app store) and put the amplifier downstairs (there is a lot of wire included, so go nuts).  Immediately ... 3-4 bars on T-Mobile, 4 bars on Verizon and 4-5 bars on AT&T.  We haven't had a single dropped call since we installed it.

4.0,Great Gimbal,"This was my first gimbal and I am very pleased. The packaging was great and really helps keep the gimbal snug.<br /><br />There is a charging cord (no wall plug), tripod, instruction manual, quick start manual, and the gimbal.<br /><br />The gimbal does require an app to be downloaded, however once you've got that setup you don't need to keep it connected to the app as it still functions outside of the app.<br /><br />I did find that with dark backgrounds it has difficult tracking your face and can cause the gimbal to turn at random. This made it frustrating as my initial recording attempts had a solid background. Once I tried it elsewhere it was far better.<br /><br />PRO TIP: If using the record feature through the app, TURN PHONE VOLUME UP, otherwise the recording will be incredibly quiet.<br /><br />I let my 3 year old and 9 year old give it a try and they handled it well and it still followed them properly.<br /><br />The tripod works incredibly well to keep any vlogger looking like the real deal as it follows you left to right as well as moving up and down. Obviously you won't want to be doing sprint drills, but if you are looking for something to allow you to move around, this is your ticket! The battery charge time is about 1 hr and it lasted through my near 1 hour of testing (though I did stop the video a few times). You also have features on the hand grip to adjust through different tracking styles as well as starting and stopping recording as well as taking photos (while in the app these work). You can check out the MOZA app to see the versatility and many options for recording and adjusting how you record or take photos.<br /><br />My only downgrade was an issue I resolved on my own and may be for many other gimbals in that the dark background caused issues. Other than that I HIGHLY recommend this product.",2020-12-04 17:37:33,0,True,great gimbal,first gimbal pleased packaging great really help keep gimbal snugbr br charging cord wall plug tripod instruction manual quick start manual gimbalbr br gimbal require app downloaded however youve got setup dont need keep connected app still function outside appbr br find dark background difficult tracking face cause gimbal turn random made frustrating initial recording attempt solid background tried elsewhere far betterbr br pro tip using record feature app turn phone volume otherwise recording incredibly quietbr br let 3 year old 9 year old give try handled well still followed properlybr br tripod work incredibly well keep vlogger looking like real deal follows left right well moving obviously wont want sprint drill looking something allow move around ticket battery charge time 1 hr lasted near 1 hour testing though stop video time also feature hand grip adjust different tracking style well starting stopping recording well taking photo app work check moza app see versatility many option recording adjusting record take photosbr br downgrade issue resolved may many gimbal dark background caused issue highly recommend product,great gimbal first gimbal pleased packaging great really help keep gimbal snugbr br charging cord wall plug tripod instruction manual quick start manual gimbalbr br gimbal require app downloaded however youve got setup dont need keep connected app still function outside appbr br find dark background difficult tracking face cause gimbal turn random made frustrating initial recording attempt solid background tried elsewhere far betterbr br pro tip using record feature app turn phone volume otherwise recording incredibly quietbr br let 3 year old 9 year old give try handled well still followed properlybr br tripod work incredibly well keep vlogger looking like real deal follows left right well moving obviously wont want sprint drill looking something allow move around ticket battery charge time 1 hr lasted near 1 hour testing though stop video time also feature hand grip adjust different tracking style well starting stopping recording well taking photo app work check moza app see versatility many option recording adjusting record take photosbr br downgrade issue resolved may many gimbal dark background caused issue highly recommend product,positive,2020,Phone Charger

5.0,Solid and Very Stable Banana Stand,"We recently had to replace the banana stand we had used for years, after it finally broke. It was a basic plastic device but it did the job. I was much more interested in finding one that would last and looked more substantial than the cheap one we had and I was very pleased to have the opportunity to work with this banana stand. It is far and away better than our old one and I am very pleased with it.<br /><br />Instead of plastic, this is a metal frame banana tree. It is made of steel and is painted a dark brown, almost black. It weighs substantially more than plastic stands and it is definitely stronger. My older stand was all plastic and what eventually gave out was the hook – this will not be an issue with this stand.<br /><br />This is a fairly large banana stand, quite a bit taller than our previous one. It can accommodate even larger bananas and it keeps them off the counter. It is also very solid and steady and does not seen to have any issues with stability, staying stable even when loaded up heavily. My older plastic one had some difficulty with this and would occasionally tumble if we tried to load it up too heavily. It is refreshing to not have to worry about this anymore.<br /><br />Aside from being heavy and stable, this is also an attractive stand and it matches well with modern kitchens as well as country or rustic kitchens.<br /><br />I am very pleased with this banana stand and am happy to recommend it. Don't bother with a plastic stand, get a good one. This is a good one and will serve you well for a long time.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

2.0,The biggest problem is Straight Talk!,"My husband got this phone a few months ago.<br />It works fine as a phone, WHEN Straight talk is working.<br /><br />You can take photos, send texts easily, and overall, everything works okay.<br />The texting area is a little small for my husband, who has to use a pen to<br />poke the little letters because of his big fingers.<br />Calls are clear, we haven't had any drop yet, so that gets a thumbs up as well.<br /><br />BUT....<br /><br />He uses the ""All You Need"" plan with this phone, which gives you 30 days of service,<br />with 1000 minutes of talk and 1000 texts, as well as some odd amount of web time.<br />That's all well and good, and it works well for him.<br />However, the Straight Talk Reserve plan has huge flaws for the All You Need cards.<br /><br />Every single month, it is a nightmare. We add a card to the reserve a few days before the<br />30 days is up. Each and every time so far, the phone stops DEAD on the 30th day, and the reserve<br />does not automatically roll over. Each time, we have to call tech support (a long, long wait<br />to reach someone who does not speak English as their native language) and go through the arduous<br />process of resetting the minutes and having him text *2_ _ _ _ (some number, not sure what it is)<br />to reactive the phone.<br /><br />That part is beyond ridiculous.<br />It is annoying, time wasting, and very inconvenient when you use your phone for work.<br /><br />At this point, we are ready to change.  Both of my college aged kids use Straight Talk<br />on the Unlimited Everything plan and don't have this problem. Apparently, the inconvenience is<br />limited to the All You Need, perhaps in some twisted attempt to get to you upgrade to the more<br />expensive plan. Either that, or they have really bad programming on the reserve!<br /><br />Either way, it is bad enough that my husband is ready to move on to another phone and another provider.<br />It's a shame, since the calls are clear.<br />But you have to be able to count on your phone, and you just can't with this one (which is for Straight Talk).<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />As of May 2013, after yet another bad experience in April with the All You Need plan not working correctly,<br />We ordered another phone from another company, and have changed over to Net10. It isn't perfect either, but the<br />unused minutes roll over without expiration dates, and no hassles at all about loading extra time.<br />Buh-bye Straight Talk!

5.0,Upgraded to 5 stars!,"The company contacted me after my previous 3 star review and immediately sent out not only a cleaning cloth but and entirely new package! I really never expected this high a level of customer service. I highly recommend purchasing from them--whatever the issue they seem dedicated to making it right! They also left a response as follows: ""When installing Skinomi Tech-skins you do not need to wait the full 12-24 hours for the screen to set by the way. Most of our customers simply wait overnight or 2-3 hours is more than sufficient. Please note you do not need a lot of solution for the screen to install well. A fine but even layer is keep to a good install. The solution itself is completely harmless Next, rather than laying the screen down all at once. Try laying it down from one side to another slowly. This will help prevent any large bubbles or imperfections from occurring. Finally, any excess bubbles or micro bubbles should disappear within 2-3 days!""<br /><br />My previous review: I found the instructions clear and packaging very good, however, the cleaning cloth was not included. I also only received 1 skin--I was under the impression that I would receive several. This seems to be a good product but I was overall disappointed since I did not get everything I paid for.

5.0,"Oh, Finally!","I was talked into getting a Google Pixel when they first came out. Let's say I was less than enchanted with it, and I still refer to it as ""U.P."" (Useless Phone). One of the things I missed from my previous phone, a Droid Turbo, was the ability to use a feature called USB on the Go. This meant you could plug a thumb drive with the proper connection into the charging port and you could therefore copy files from the thumb drive to the phone and vice versa. I was astonished that you could not also do this with the fancy, much vaunted upon Pixel.<br /><br />Over the years I have bought several of these double connector thumb drives (with a regulation USB connector at one end and a USB-C type connector at the other) in the vain hope that the newest model would connect with this daft Pixel, but no dice. Still hoping, I ordered this Leizhan thumb drive, which, once again, worked perfectly with my computer, but the stupid Pixel would not read the drive, even though it now had a different, upgraded version of the operating system than when I bought it.<br /><br />And then...I asked for help again on the Pixel assistance board, and someone advised me what to do (it involved going into a setting menu and changing something), and this lovely flash drive FINALLY WORKS with my phone. I can't believe how long it took to get this to happen.<br /><br />The drive is great; very fast, plugs securely into both the computer and into the phone.

2.0,"Not the Best Engineering, Not for Heavy Cameras","Endurax Cell Phone Tripod 60"" isn't sturdy enough for heavier cameras. A simple point-and-shoot or cell phone would probably work fine. It's stated on the box it will hold up to 6.6lbs, but I wouldn't recommend any more than 3lbs. The tension thumb screws lock into place with little nuts that will drop out of the head mount if you loosen too far, which is easy to do. If this happens in the grass, they would be easily lost. One of the tension thumb screws and nuts isn't pre-positioned, it's in a baggie and the instructions state how to place it. The other 2 tension thumb screws are already positioned, so I'm unsure why this is sent to customers without being fully assembled. The cell phone holder does extend to hold some of the wider phones, so that is nice. There is a remote included. I don't use those, so I cannot comment on that. The tension for the spread of the tripod legs isn't terribly secure, and without some counter weights, it could easily topple over. Usually, camera tripods have a hook to hold some counter weights, but this one does not. The legs are not terribly sturdy, so I certainly would not try a very heavy camera on this tripod.<br /><br />However, if you are looking for a budget tripod for a light-weight camera, ring light or something else light-weight, this will do the job. It's not the worst tripod I have tested and reviewed, but it's far, far from the best. I wouldn't recommend this one because the nuts can fall out and be lost so easily, making it useless. If the nuts were securely placed, and there was a hook for counter weights, this would be a better value. If I do use this beyond testing, I'm adding some tape to cover the slots for the thumb screw nuts. I'm also not going to use this anywhere it may be accidentally bumped, or in wind because it's just going to topple over so easily. This would be better for very occasional indoor use.<br /><br />The two nice points I can find is that a carrying/storage bag is included and the legs extend easily are are easy to adjust.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review.

5.0,Great Option..,"Used for one week daily before reviewing. It's a good case, not great but good. The phone case itself holds the phone securely and even has a lip for more protection.  It comes with a screen protector as well so the value is there. The wallet portion is just OK. I've had wallet cases that have more card slots while still being compact. I will have to take an additional wallet with me to hold all my cards. Three slots are not enough. The magnetic side is also not strong enough. Again, I've had other wallets that grip the phone when reconnected. This one feels not as strong. However, the snap closure prevents the phone from detaching in a fall which helps. So, I try not walk around  too much with it open. The case itself is thin enough to allow QI charging on the pad and in my vehicle. I can drop it in to the slot and it fits allows for fast charging. Finally, the case feels like leather. I know that it's not but it's not plastic-y.<br />If it had enough slots to replace a normal wallet it would be perfect, but I will still give it 5 stars.",2021-07-05 20:30:59,0,True,great option,used one week daily reviewing good case great good phone case hold phone securely even lip protection come screen protector well value wallet portion ok ive wallet case card slot still compact take additional wallet hold card three slot enough magnetic side also strong enough ive wallet grip phone reconnected one feel strong however snap closure prevents phone detaching fall help try walk around much open case thin enough allow qi charging pad vehicle drop slot fit allows fast charging finally case feel like leather know plasticybr enough slot replace normal wallet would perfect still give 5 star,great option used one week daily reviewing good case great good phone case hold phone securely even lip protection come screen protector well value wallet portion ok ive wallet case card slot still compact take additional wallet hold card three slot enough magnetic side also strong enough ive wallet grip phone reconnected one feel strong however snap closure prevents phone detaching fall help try walk around much open case thin enough allow qi charging pad vehicle drop slot fit allows fast charging finally case feel like leather know plasticybr enough slot replace normal wallet would perfect still give 5 star,positive,2021,Phone Case

5.0,samsung galaxy s10+ cover,"I just got my brand new Samsung Galaxy s10+ - and this the same cover I loved and used for years on my galaxy s7!  I love the print.. I love the look.  Here's the thing... the best part about this cover print?  Its printed on the INSIDE!!  That means the print will STAY on a LOT longer than those that are printed on the outside of the case.  Trust me on this.  In any case, I am thrilled that the print I loved for all these years, the reliability of the case and funtionality is still available to me.  I have the black phone.  So the print really shows nicely.  I mostly use wireless charging platforms, and it easily charges through the case without any issue. When I have plugged into the phone with my car cord, no issues - stays plugged in while in the case. LITTLE TIP:  I actually put the little SD ""key"" inside the case as it usually gets lost -  it fits easily inside the case, is fairly hidden in the print and doesn't move around.  The case is firm, but not brittle plastic.. it's a bit rubbery so it fits the phone perfectly and protects from the daily bumps and grinds with a little lip/edge and reinforced at the corners.  It does NOT hinder the function of the phone at the edges at all.  I love it.  Having said all of that...

5.0,Excellent Value!,"Lightning cables are a necessary part of owning an iPhone, iPad or iPod. The problem is that Apple-branded cables are expensive and not all third-party parts are worth buying. I have seen cables that are poorly made with sub-par materials and I have seen some high-end cables too. This three-pack of cables is a no-frills set of cables, but it has one thing that is unusual that makes it very much worth consideration – a lifetime warranty.<br /><br />This is a very inexpensive set of cables, costing (at this time) just $10 for a three-pack. That’s about half of what a single Apple-branded cable costs. That alone gave me pause when I ordered – would these be made well enough to hold up over time?<br /><br />They seem to be made well enough. The plug ends are hard molded plastic with no seams so they will not fall apart unless broken or cracked. They have rubber sleeves to help reinforce the connection with the wires which adds some strength when bending. The wires themselves are insulated in tight-fitting plastic that is well-attached to the plugs – I was unable to pull the insulation away from the plugs which would have exposed the wires underneath. This is a no-nonsense design.<br /><br />What makes these cables worth the purchase is the fact that the company offers a lifetime warranty on them. To service a $3 cable will cost the company far more than $3, so they must feel confident that their cables will hold up. They would not stand behind them with a warranty of any kind.<br /><br />As plain cables these are not especially remarkable, good or bad. But, considering that the price per unit is so low, the quality seems to be comparable to Apple-branded cables and the company offers a lifetime warranty, it is hard to ignore these as a viable option, especially if you want more than just one cable.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

My daughter loves using this to go to the movies or places with her friends. She can slip her debit card or cash in the back and she's good to go. She does not like the wallet style phone cases, so this is a good alternative. There is a piece underneath the straps that can be removed. It's a little difficult to put back in place, but not impossible. The bands stretch so they can accommodate slight thickness such as keys. The Under Armour logo is pretty discreet.

I can still talk on the phone (a little awkwardly) and take pictures while it is in the case. For one charger I can plug it in just fine but for another charger it's like the prongs of it are too short so it just falls out, so it really depends on the charger. It just means I have to take it out of the case when I use that particular charger, which is a little tough to do. The magnet is quite weak and that would be my only real complaint. it doesn't pop open, but it feels like it will come unlatched easily. It holds my debit card, driver's license, and cash.

5.0,For selfies and more,"I have verified that the review sample that I received will will fit a Samsung Note 3 phone and an iPhone 6 Plus. If you have one of the larger phones the chances are that it will fit. This one has bluetooth shutter control, which is a major plus as far as I am concerned.  If you are comparison shopping keep in mind tnat there are more than one type of these on the market even though they all look similar.<br /><br />Personally I am not a selfie sort of person (if you saw a clear photo of my face you'd know why). Where this excels for me is it's ideal for steadying my camera on tables, balcony rails and other spots. This allows me to take some great photos. Of course, it certainly works for selfies, but is ideal for taking steady shots of panoramic views and close ups of smaller objects. If you use your camera for a lot of photography or videos this is actually an essential accessory.<br /><br />When you first unbox this and set it up the top hook seems to be fixed, but is actually a spring loaded grabber arm. The bottom part of the adapter that attaches to the telescoping handle is also adjustable, but it manually slides.<br /><br />Pairing and connecting is very easy. I literally switched it on, scanned for it and it popped up as an available bluetooth device. Since it's coded as an input device it will not interfere with head sets and hand's free receivers. Both can be connected to your phone simultaneously. A press of the trigger and you snap photos without jitter that is associated with manually snapping them.

5.0,Good even if used for just lighting.,"Okay I've yet to test how many times I can charge my devices with this. My initial test was to determine how long the charger would last ruining the led lights it has on board. I set it to low setting and the room is large, at that setting the room looks like it has dimmer switch but bright enough too see everything in the room no problem. This particular test is to see how long it will run the led lights on low. I've had it on continentaly thus far for 8 hours and when I checked how much power the unit had left suprising to me it's still at 4 blue bars which is near 100% and that's amazing!

5.0,"The header makes it sound as if this is a 1 item, but they are actually selling 2 different types. Be aware of this before order","I went by the title which said it was contained survival items and could be used as a pill container. I chose this dark green one only because I liked the color the best. When I got it I thought there isn't any room for pills unless you remove the survival items so I guessed (wrongly) that is why it was advertised as a pill container. But when I just went back to the webpage, I noticed that some of the items looked different. That was when I realized there were 2 different items! You can get the one with the survival kit OR you can get one to use as a pill container. I don't know how the size differs. The survival one and the pill one comes in orange or black. Also, this darker forest green has the survival kit and the light neon green is for pills. I'm thinking about putting the survival kit in my knife which has a handle I can unscrew and put things in. Then I'm going to see how many of my pills will fit in this one. I know it won't be as many since there is the side which is kind of cut back (as you can see in this photo). But since it has good feedback for being water resistant (it has an extra O-ring), I will see if I can put some pills my version after taking the survival kit out.<br /><br />Since the survival cut version and the pill version, I would go with the survival version since they are the same price and this version has a rough pad inside you can strike a match on which is handy and you do get the extra items. The pill version is more straight (no curves like this one) and is empty though it also comes with the ring to put a lanyard on and an extra O-ring).<br /><br />Since it is coming overseas, don't expect it right away (so no 2-day delivery Prime members)!

5.0,Impressive design,The design in minimal and the look is great. I got clear and it’s as close as I want to get to having no case. I love having a protected screen. It seems like great drop protection. And the screen looks great on Day 1.

5.0,Just got free accessory for my ring light!,"I got this ring light in July 2020 and this week, in October 2020, I just got a package saying the company just received a new accessoary for their ring light customers and they didn't want to leave me out. The accessoary is the attachment that allows you to place your mobile phone in the middle of the light. There was always a connection point there, but I originally did not get that attachment. I don't remember if it was in the photograph of what ships wiht the ring light when I originally bought it in July. I assume not. It is in the photo of what you get when you order this now. It works much better than the phone attachment that attaches to the stand below the light because it is flexible and easy to reposition once the phone is already attached to it.<br /><br />The wonderful thing is that without charging me anything more, the company decided this should be with the package I bought several months ago and without any request from me, they shipped it to me.<br /><br />The whole light set up works really well. My favorite things are: (1)  It has 3 settings for the light tone. (2) The tripod is super configurable so I can sit it on my desk or stand it on the floor and it works equally well both ways. (3)  The remote control works GREAT! It allows me to take a photo with my iPhone and also will start recording a video with the iPhone.",2020-10-19 13:59:59,0,True,got free accessory ring light,got ring light july 2020 week october 2020 got package saying company received new accessoary ring light customer didnt want leave accessoary attachment allows place mobile phone middle light always connection point originally get attachment dont remember photograph ship wiht ring light originally bought july assume photo get order work much better phone attachment attache stand light flexible easy reposition phone already attached itbr br wonderful thing without charging anything company decided package bought several month ago without request shipped mebr br whole light set work really well favorite thing 1 3 setting light tone 2 tripod super configurable sit desk stand floor work equally well way 3 remote control work great allows take photo iphone also start recording video iphone,got free accessory ring light got ring light july 2020 week october 2020 got package saying company received new accessoary ring light customer didnt want leave accessoary attachment allows place mobile phone middle light always connection point originally get attachment dont remember photograph ship wiht ring light originally bought july assume photo get order work much better phone attachment attache stand light flexible easy reposition phone already attached itbr br wonderful thing without charging anything company decided package bought several month ago without request shipped mebr br whole light set work really well favorite thing 1 3 setting light tone 2 tripod super configurable sit desk stand floor work equally well way 3 remote control work great allows take photo iphone also start recording video iphone,positive,2020,Phone Stand

3.0,Heavy!,"I switched from the Amazon Fire line of tablets which kept failing on me (4 in one year) and found the Lenovo tablet in my price range. At the time I bought the tablet there were very few covers available. I bought another model from this same company. It was horrible and I returned it. This became available and I jumped at the chance. The biggest issue is the weight, this is over 8 ounces, half the weight of the tablet. It really bulks  up your lightweight table badly and that's disappointing. But it does a decent job of protecting the tablet. The case has magnets which turn the tablet on and off as you open it. Problem there is the way the case configures it covers the rear camera port so they put in a creased corner you can flop down and use the camera with the cover back. This corner also has magnets in it. They should have been left out of this section because it's so floppy it won't stay closed so it's constantly turning the table on and off as the case gets moved around. This is truly annoying though far less annoying than the cover I returned. I'm not 100% happy with this but it was necessary because the tablet was too slippery without a case. I'll live with it.",2020-09-27 20:46:45,1,False,heavy,switched amazon fire line tablet kept failing 4 one year found lenovo tablet price range time bought tablet cover available bought another model company horrible returned became available jumped chance biggest issue weight 8 ounce half weight tablet really bulk lightweight table badly thats disappointing decent job protecting tablet case magnet turn tablet open problem way case configures cover rear camera port put creased corner flop use camera cover back corner also magnet left section floppy wont stay closed constantly turning table case get moved around truly annoying though far less annoying cover returned im 100 happy necessary tablet slippery without case ill live,heavy switched amazon fire line tablet kept failing 4 one year found lenovo tablet price range time bought tablet cover available bought another model company horrible returned became available jumped chance biggest issue weight 8 ounce half weight tablet really bulk lightweight table badly thats disappointing decent job protecting tablet case magnet turn tablet open problem way case configures cover rear camera port put creased corner flop use camera cover back corner also magnet left section floppy wont stay closed constantly turning table case get moved around truly annoying though far less annoying cover returned im 100 happy necessary tablet slippery without case ill live,negative,2020,Screen Protector

5.0,Great iPhone 14 Pro Privacy Screen Protector Set,When we invest what we do in an iPhone it’s important to protect the most vulnerable part of the device which is the screen.  I always keep tempered glass protectors on my iPhones to protect the screen - I have one placed on my phone prior to ever using it for the first time.<br /><br />I used this set with my iPhone 14 Pro and they held up incredibly well.  I tend to be rough on my phone - I don’t try to be but I just have crazy things happen.<br /><br />These screens have saved my having to have the screen replaced more times than I can count.  From drops to carrying my phone in my pocket with other items these screens worked exactly as they are intended.<br /><br />They are easy to apply - the key is to make sure your iPhone screen is completely clean and free of dust particles.  The set comes with everything you’ll need.<br /><br />These privacy screens can take a bit of getting used to as your screen will only be visible from straight on - this can be a benefit and a hinderance.  Often I was used to glancing at my phone when I had a notification but with this protector I must most often actually lift my phone to look at it.<br /><br />Something I have learned with screen protectors that seems specific to the last couple generations is if it is listed as edge to edge where the screen protector wraps around the edge of the screen issues arise with cases.  This is the type of screen protector you want - look for “phone case friendly.”  This set has proven excellent.<br /><br />I have had no issues with these protectors on my iPhone 14 Pro.<br /><br />This is an outstanding deal for 2 screen protectors that you can count on to protect your investment.,2022-11-07 12:36:32,0,False,great iphone 14 pro privacy screen protector set,invest iphone important protect vulnerable part device screen always keep tempered glass protector iphones protect screen one placed phone prior ever using first timebr br used set iphone 14 pro held incredibly well tend rough phone dont try crazy thing happenbr br screen saved screen replaced time count drop carrying phone pocket item screen worked exactly intendedbr br easy apply key make sure iphone screen completely clean free dust particle set come everything youll needbr br privacy screen take bit getting used screen visible straight benefit hinderance often used glancing phone notification protector must often actually lift phone look itbr br something learned screen protector seems specific last couple generation listed edge edge screen protector wrap around edge screen issue arise case type screen protector want look phone case friendly set proven excellentbr br issue protector iphone 14 probr br outstanding deal 2 screen protector count protect investment,great iphone 14 pro privacy screen protector set invest iphone important protect vulnerable part device screen always keep tempered glass protector iphones protect screen one placed phone prior ever using first timebr br used set iphone 14 pro held incredibly well tend rough phone dont try crazy thing happenbr br screen saved screen replaced time count drop carrying phone pocket item screen worked exactly intendedbr br easy apply key make sure iphone screen completely clean free dust particle set come everything youll needbr br privacy screen take bit getting used screen visible straight benefit hinderance often used glancing phone notification protector must often actually lift phone look itbr br something learned screen protector seems specific last couple generation listed edge edge screen protector wrap around edge screen issue arise case type screen protector want look phone case friendly set proven excellentbr br issue protector iphone 14 probr br outstanding deal 2 screen protector count protect investment,positive,2022,Screen Protector

3.0,Don't want to return but magnet causing issue with phone,"I had high hopes for this mount and although the product appears good quality the magnet is not compatible with my phone at least. I have a Samsung Galaxy Grand 2 Duos. It is not a phablet but with even a thin case on it the stretch for the cradle type mounts requires too much effort and scary pushing/squishing/flexing of the phone. I thought this was the answer to my prayers.<br /><br />It was packaged nicely and all parts were fine. Does seem like a quality product. I put one of the metal plates between the rubberized case and the phone's case, high middle of the back. The phone went to sleep. I turned it on with a touch on home button and the screen was kerfluffled. It was all black except for a music note symbol, some other symbols and the time. No response to any screen touches. I had to power off and reboot without magnet to back home screen.<br /><br />I experimented with different places of plate/magnet. If I went lower I would get a popup saying I was using an unknown network and might incur charges, huh?<br /><br />So, I need to give up. Your mileage will vary. I can say as far as this model of phone I would steer clear of the magnets. Has nothing to do with mfr or vendor I am sure, it is just the magnetic field type of connection that is not compatible with my particular phone.  So I figure the fair thing to do is give it a medium rating. There is nothing I can see wrong with it but my phone doesn't like it.",2015-07-20 22:53:31,7,True,dont want return magnet causing issue phone,high hope mount although product appears good quality magnet compatible phone least samsung galaxy grand 2 duo phablet even thin case stretch cradle type mount requires much effort scary pushingsquishingflexing phone thought answer prayersbr br packaged nicely part fine seem like quality product put one metal plate rubberized case phone case high middle back phone went sleep turned touch home button screen kerfluffled black except music note symbol symbol time response screen touch power reboot without magnet back home screenbr br experimented different place platemagnet went lower would get popup saying using unknown network might incur charge huhbr br need give mileage vary say far model phone would steer clear magnet nothing mfr vendor sure magnetic field type connection compatible particular phone figure fair thing give medium rating nothing see wrong phone doesnt like,dont want return magnet causing issue phone high hope mount although product appears good quality magnet compatible phone least samsung galaxy grand 2 duo phablet even thin case stretch cradle type mount requires much effort scary pushingsquishingflexing phone thought answer prayersbr br packaged nicely part fine seem like quality product put one metal plate rubberized case phone case high middle back phone went sleep turned touch home button screen kerfluffled black except music note symbol symbol time response screen touch power reboot without magnet back home screenbr br experimented different place platemagnet went lower would get popup saying using unknown network might incur charge huhbr br need give mileage vary say far model phone would steer clear magnet nothing mfr vendor sure magnetic field type connection compatible particular phone figure fair thing give medium rating nothing see wrong phone doesnt like,positive,2015,Phone Case

5.0,Some designer knocked one out of the park,"Most of the review samples I receive are a slight variation on the same theme, so when an exception like this one gets sent to me I smile. Before I go off on a tangent I want to describe this holder and why I love it.<br /><br />This is the first (and thus far only) holder that I have evaluated that will positively hold my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and keep it exactly where I want it. The two suction cup design is clever because it gives me not only more flexibility than other holds provide, but also a margin of safety. If one cup were to fail for any reason the other is strong enough to keep your precious phone or small tablet from becoming a projectile.<br /><br />The package ships with two holders - one for small tablets up to seven inches, and a smaller one for phones. The smaller one is the one that fits my Note 3. Both have spring loaded grabber arms that firmly hold your phone or tablet. There is a thin, soft film on the inside of the arms, but not on the part that contacts the back of your tablet or phone.<br /><br />There are two types of suction cups employed in the design. The base cup uses a lever to actuate a vacuum and it holds tightly to most surfaces. I tries nit out on my pebble-grained dashboard in my 2014 Mitsubishi Outlander and it gripped the surface like it became a part of it. That cup, though, was designed for the windshield, with the second cup designed to hold the flexible gooseneck stable from an attach point on your dashboard. It, too, held that surface firmly and made a big difference in stabilizing and supporting my Note 3.<br /><br />Unfortunately I have no tablets smaller than 10.1 inches, so was unable to test the larger holder. From the rock solid way the assembly held my Note 3, though, I have no doubt it will easily support any seven inch tablet on the market.<br /><br />Of all of the mounts that I have tested this one is a paragon of design, engineering and construction. It's easily a five star product and one I highly recommend.",2014-04-02 11:20:08,67,False,designer knocked one park,review sample receive slight variation theme exception like one get sent smile go tangent want describe holder love itbr br first thus far holder evaluated positively hold samsung galaxy note 3 keep exactly want two suction cup design clever give flexibility hold provide also margin safety one cup fail reason strong enough keep precious phone small tablet becoming projectilebr br package ship two holder one small tablet seven inch smaller one phone smaller one one fit note 3 spring loaded grabber arm firmly hold phone tablet thin soft film inside arm part contact back tablet phonebr br two type suction cup employed design base cup us lever actuate vacuum hold tightly surface try nit pebblegrained dashboard 2014 mitsubishi outlander gripped surface like became part cup though designed windshield second cup designed hold flexible gooseneck stable attach point dashboard held surface firmly made big difference stabilizing supporting note 3br br unfortunately tablet smaller 101 inch unable test larger holder rock solid way assembly held note 3 though doubt easily support seven inch tablet marketbr br mount tested one paragon design engineering construction easily five star product one highly recommend,designer knocked one park review sample receive slight variation theme exception like one get sent smile go tangent want describe holder love itbr br first thus far holder evaluated positively hold samsung galaxy note 3 keep exactly want two suction cup design clever give flexibility hold provide also margin safety one cup fail reason strong enough keep precious phone small tablet becoming projectilebr br package ship two holder one small tablet seven inch smaller one phone smaller one one fit note 3 spring loaded grabber arm firmly hold phone tablet thin soft film inside arm part contact back tablet phonebr br two type suction cup employed design base cup us lever actuate vacuum hold tightly surface try nit pebblegrained dashboard 2014 mitsubishi outlander gripped surface like became part cup though designed windshield second cup designed hold flexible gooseneck stable attach point dashboard held surface firmly made big difference stabilizing supporting note 3br br unfortunately tablet smaller 101 inch unable test larger holder rock solid way assembly held note 3 though doubt easily support seven inch tablet marketbr br mount tested one paragon design engineering construction easily five star product one highly recommend,positive,2014,Phone Holder

4.0,"I like it as a tripod.  Selfie stick, not so much","I really like this tripod and I’ve had it for 2 1/2 years now.  The clamps feel solid and I like how easy they extend.

I only have to charge it once in awhile.  I think this is more geared to be a tripod than a selfie stick.  As a selfie stick it is difficult for me to hold and is uncomfortable since I have small hands and it’s a little heavy for me.  You’re basically holding the 3 legs folded up in your hand so it’s really bulky for me.  So, I just use this mostly for the tripod to take pictures and video calls.

4.0,Storage for Your Phone and More,"When you exercise, you need a place to store things. Preferably, the storage is in a place where it won’t interfere with your workout and be too noticeable as you move around. I’m normally fine with putting things in my pocket while I walk, but if I’m jogging, cycling, etc it can get uncomfortable. A good alternative to shorts pockets is this Cell Phone Armband with Airpods Bag Running Armband from Haissky<br /><br />To use this, you just wrap it around your arm and hold in place with the Velcro. If your arm is smaller than average, you can adjust it to fit. The emphasis seems to be on using this for iphones, but it can be used with other smartphones also.<br /><br />The best thing about this armband is that it is slick to the touch and moisture repellant, so it keeps you feeling cool. And with it on your arm, it doesn’t restrict movement. It’s also nice that it has a separate pocket to hold your keys, spare change, and so on, plus a slot for cards. Bear in mind, however, that the pocket isn’t that big- it’s too small to hold a full wallet, for example. But you can easily fit your credit card and a little bit of cash or coin in the pocket, so that should be sufficient.<br /><br />With the preponderance of electronics, we need to have a place to store them. This armband is a good item for this purpose. It keeps your cellphone up and out of the way when you exercise and it’s comfortable to wear. I still try to use my regular pockets when I can, but this armband does provide a useful alternative.",2020-12-02 17:46:42,0,False,storage phone,exercise need place store thing preferably storage place wont interfere workout noticeable move around im normally fine putting thing pocket walk im jogging cycling etc get uncomfortable good alternative short pocket cell phone armband airpods bag running armband haisskybr br use wrap around arm hold place velcro arm smaller average adjust fit emphasis seems using iphones used smartphones alsobr br best thing armband slick touch moisture repellant keep feeling cool arm doesnt restrict movement also nice separate pocket hold key spare change plus slot card bear mind however pocket isnt big small hold full wallet example easily fit credit card little bit cash coin pocket sufficientbr br preponderance electronics need place store armband good item purpose keep cellphone way exercise comfortable wear still try use regular pocket armband provide useful alternative,storage phone exercise need place store thing preferably storage place wont interfere workout noticeable move around im normally fine putting thing pocket walk im jogging cycling etc get uncomfortable good alternative short pocket cell phone armband airpods bag running armband haisskybr br use wrap around arm hold place velcro arm smaller average adjust fit emphasis seems using iphones used smartphones alsobr br best thing armband slick touch moisture repellant keep feeling cool arm doesnt restrict movement also nice separate pocket hold key spare change plus slot card bear mind however pocket isnt big small hold full wallet example easily fit credit card little bit cash coin pocket sufficientbr br preponderance electronics need place store armband good item purpose keep cellphone way exercise comfortable wear still try use regular pocket armband provide useful alternative,positive,2020,Phone Holder

5.0,"Sturdy, Solid Stand Fits iPad, Galaxy S7 Edge","This beautifully made, sturdy UNIVERSAL DUAL FOLDABLE MULTI ANGLE PHONE/TABLET STAND is the best adjustable stand ever!  It fits both my iPad Air2 and my Galaxy S7 Edge phone, incredible as that may sound.<br /><br />The cradle portion has curved-up tips with gripper lining that holds a large tablet or a small cellphone securely.  The stand portion can be adjusted to virtually any viewing angle or height.  The base portion has gripper backing so it doesn’t slide on the surface beneath it.<br /><br />In using this with an iPad, you can adjust the cradle to rest on a table, along with the base, and this creates a really solid stand that doesn’t rock or jiggle when you type on it.  The folding joints are quite stiff—it takes some hand pressure to move them—but this is a good thing, because they “remember” their position.  The stand does NOT collapse easily.<br /><br />I love the light charcoal, metallic “Space Gray” color.

1.0,After 10 months this phone has crapped out.,"The phone works properly and was easy to set up through our Net10 account.  Adding a memory card was simple as was installing SIM cards.  I'm not too sure about having a non replaceable battery, we'll just have to see how long it lasts.  One star off for the picture and video quality.  It is noticeably lesser quality than my previous Samsung phone.  It is adequate, not excellent in that department.<br /><br />UPDATE 6-10-2016:  After 10 months this phone has crapped out.  The menu and home buttons now only vibrate and do nothing else.  This was after I was forced to do a factory reset because the phone all of a sudden refused to open past an Alcatel splash screen...<br />This phone was used very little, never saw anything close to abuse, and had no additional software installed except for the endless automatic updates for the pre-installed apps the phone would initiate every time it was hooked to WiFi.  This quickly ate up the phone's internal memory, regardless of having a 16Gb memory card installed (phone only comes with 2Gb internal memory).

5.0,Snap it on and shoot,"I received a review sample in exchange for a review and have been having a blast with this simple-but-cool lens.<br /><br />The instructions discuss screwing the lens into a ""slim-line protective case"" when in fact that case is actually the clip and mine came  in the sealed package already installed. A few things you need to note:<br /><br />- If you are using a protective case for your phone (I am using a [[ASIN:B009VKSVTC Evecase Leather Wallet Case with Stand and Credit Card Holder for Samsung Galaxy Note 2]]) you need to remove your phone before you can clip on this lens.<br /><br />- This is a true fisheye lens that will capture a full 180 degrees. I took a shot of my music room, which normally takes three shots to fully capture and the one shot managed to include all of my amps, drums and instruments.<br /><br />- There is NO magnification. This is a straight through lens with the fisheye effect as the only feature.<br /><br />- Your photos will be framed in what will look like a black mat over a porthole. Sort of like a spy shot, and also ultra cool for some unique views of wide areas.<br /><br />I am concerned that the clip extends over my screen on my phone. There is a soft plastic patch with a slight texture that holds the lens in place and seems to protect the lens from scratching. On the other hand I had to reposition the lens to get to my camera icon on the screen. Since this is a new tool I am sure I will discover convenient workarounds. If so I will be sure to update this review.<br /><br />The package itself is simple: it comes with the lens pre-screwed into the clip, a small cloth bag and a lens cover. The latter is a nice touch. The price is nominal considering the quality of the photos I have taken with this already. In fact, I have been able to shoot some interesting pictures. It's a shame that Amazon has eliminated the customer-supplied image feature because a few pictures are worth thousands of words.<br /><br />For the price you cannot go wrong. Especially if you are used to shooting multiple times to get an entire subject. The best thing I can say is had I not been provided with a review sample I would purchased one of these anyway. They are that useful in certain situations and very high quality.",2013-07-22 18:42:34,16,False,snap shoot,received review sample exchange review blast simplebutcool lensbr br instruction discus screwing lens slimline protective case fact case actually clip mine came sealed package already installed thing need notebr br using protective case phone using asinb009vksvtc evecase leather wallet case stand credit card holder samsung galaxy note 2 need remove phone clip lensbr br true fisheye lens capture full 180 degree took shot music room normally take three shot fully capture one shot managed include amp drum instrumentsbr br magnification straight lens fisheye effect featurebr br photo framed look like black mat porthole sort like spy shot also ultra cool unique view wide areasbr br concerned clip extends screen phone soft plastic patch slight texture hold lens place seems protect lens scratching hand reposition lens get camera icon screen since new tool sure discover convenient workarounds sure update reviewbr br package simple come lens prescrewed clip small cloth bag lens cover latter nice touch price nominal considering quality photo taken already fact able shoot interesting picture shame amazon eliminated customersupplied image feature picture worth thousand wordsbr br price go wrong especially used shooting multiple time get entire subject best thing say provided review sample would purchased one anyway useful certain situation high quality,snap shoot received review sample exchange review blast simplebutcool lensbr br instruction discus screwing lens slimline protective case fact case actually clip mine came sealed package already installed thing need notebr br using protective case phone using asinb009vksvtc evecase leather wallet case stand credit card holder samsung galaxy note 2 need remove phone clip lensbr br true fisheye lens capture full 180 degree took shot music room normally take three shot fully capture one shot managed include amp drum instrumentsbr br magnification straight lens fisheye effect featurebr br photo framed look like black mat porthole sort like spy shot also ultra cool unique view wide areasbr br concerned clip extends screen phone soft plastic patch slight texture hold lens place seems protect lens scratching hand reposition lens get camera icon screen since new tool sure discover convenient workarounds sure update reviewbr br package simple come lens prescrewed clip small cloth bag lens cover latter nice touch price nominal considering quality photo taken already fact able shoot interesting picture shame amazon eliminated customersupplied image feature picture worth thousand wordsbr br price go wrong especially used shooting multiple time get entire subject best thing say provided review sample would purchased one anyway useful certain situation high quality,positive,2013,Phone Case
5.0,Best invention ever- Should be standard on devices,"The best invention since sliced bread… I don’t understand why a cell phone doesn’t come equipped with this type of handle built-in? For the mom of four kids who is constantly multitasking and doing so, with 62.5 Things in her hand at any given time… I love that I can hook this to my finger and not worry about dropping or, can even use as handle to carry while carrying other items as well!!<br /><br />This is straightforward to put on and can be placed directly onto the cell phone back… I didn’t choose to do that as I didn’t want gummy residue left on my actual iPhone. Nor, did I want my iPhone naked and not protected without a case - So, I put this on the outside of my case and it went on without any issue.<br /><br />I know this can be used as a stand to prop your device and watch video. Although I do not use it in this capacity… It is an added feature or bonus!<br /><br />The stick is pretty immediate so, take the time to make sure it’s straight and in your appropriate range to feel comfortable when holding phone. For my hand size… The actual placement is directly in the middle and slightly longer than halfway in center of the phone. Before taking the sticker off, put ring on middle finger and align to a comfortable fit- and mark it! this is the best way to ensure you get the appropriate placement.<br /><br />One way to improve this product- Would be to include a “card stock template square” such as a (3x4)?. Something with straight edges and having a cutout into the middle- of the ring adhesive shape and size.. that way, it could be used to align the item exactly straight when placing the semi permanent adhesive onto the actual device.<br />If a straight edged of a template could easily align with at least x1 side of any said devices edge..<br /><br />Overall, these are worth their weight in gold. They do not take away from the overall look of the case. The clear adhesive makes only the metal ring stand out.

5.0,Luxurious and functional,"I have a thing for cases so when I was offered a review sample of this one I leaped at the opportunity. This case stands out from others that I own in a number of ways.  First, the credit card/ID slots are wider than on most of the ones I own. Of the eight other ones I own all have slots that are 2.25 inches wide; this has slots that are 2 7/8 inches wide, so it's more versatile with respect to what I can store in this area of the case. The billfold area is correspondingly longer as well, which is handy if you are in or traveling to countries that use wider paper currency.<br /><br />However, what it most important to me is the protection that this case affords. I am going to directly compare this to the case I was using before this one arrived: a [[ASIN:B00ESAGVLK Bear Motion for Galaxy Note 3 - 100% Genuine Lambskin Folio Case]]. Both have precision cutouts for buttons, camera flash and even the same style hard plastic retainer part that firmly holds the Note 3 in place.  Here is where this case leaves that one in the dust:<br /><br />- Thicker Leather: this one has an outer and inner layer of leather on the front that provides a lot more padding and protection than the Bear Motion model. Of course this one is priced significantly higher than that one, so I am not questioning the basic value of the Bear Motion. It's just that I think this one is worth the premium price for the protection alone.<br /><br />- Heavier Fastener: the fastener on the Bear Motion model out after about six months of use. It was a fairly thin piece of leather. The fastener on this case is two layers of stitched leather that is thicker and stronger. I did extensively test this with the S-Pen and there is no interference from the magnetic closure. The magnet used is relatively weak. More about that below,<br /><br />- Back Side Protects: most of the cases I own have thicker fronts with the lack of the case thinner and less protective. This one has a thicker back side that provides more protection than any other case I own for the Note 3.<br /><br />There is one potentially weak spot and that is the way the magnetic fastener closes. It holds, but I am not sure it would stay shut and totally protect the phone by holding the front cover in place if I dropped it and it bounced. And frankly I just do not have the courage to do a drop test with my Note 3. The trade-off here is the convenience of a magnetic fastener without interfering with the S-Pen. I know that the snap style fasteners quickly wear out - that is evident on the Bear Motion case to which I am comparing this.<br /><br />The fact that this will be my Note 3's case going forward (unless something even better comes along) says it all. I love the looks, feel and the assurance that I have superb protection. Personally this one is worth every penny of the premium price and has already elicited compliments.",2014-03-25 13:25:05,3,False,luxurious functional,thing case offered review sample one leaped opportunity case stand others number way first credit cardid slot wider one eight one slot 225 inch wide slot 2 78 inch wide versatile respect store area case billfold area correspondingly longer well handy traveling country use wider paper currencybr br however important protection case affords going directly compare case using one arrived asinb00esagvlk bear motion galaxy note 3 100 genuine lambskin folio case precision cutout button camera flash even style hard plastic retainer part firmly hold note 3 place case leaf one dustbr br thicker leather one outer inner layer leather front provides lot padding protection bear motion model course one priced significantly higher one questioning basic value bear motion think one worth premium price protection alonebr br heavier fastener fastener bear motion model six month use fairly thin piece leather fastener case two layer stitched leather thicker stronger extensively test spen interference magnetic closure magnet used relatively weak belowbr br back side protects case thicker front lack case thinner less protective one thicker back side provides protection case note 3br br one potentially weak spot way magnetic fastener close hold sure would stay shut totally protect phone holding front cover place dropped bounced frankly courage drop test note 3 tradeoff convenience magnetic fastener without interfering spen know snap style fastener quickly wear evident bear motion case comparing thisbr br fact note 3 case going forward unless something even better come along say love look feel assurance superb protection personally one worth every penny premium price already elicited compliment,luxurious functional thing case offered review sample one leaped opportunity case stand others number way first credit cardid slot wider one eight one slot 225 inch wide slot 2 78 inch wide versatile respect store area case billfold area correspondingly longer well handy traveling country use wider paper currencybr br however important protection case affords going directly compare case using one arrived asinb00esagvlk bear motion galaxy note 3 100 genuine lambskin folio case precision cutout button camera flash even style hard plastic retainer part firmly hold note 3 place case leaf one dustbr br thicker leather one outer inner layer leather front provides lot padding protection bear motion model course one priced significantly higher one questioning basic value bear motion think one worth premium price protection alonebr br heavier fastener fastener bear motion model six month use fairly thin piece leather fastener case two layer stitched leather thicker stronger extensively test spen interference magnetic closure magnet used relatively weak belowbr br back side protects case thicker front lack case thinner less protective one thicker back side provides protection case note 3br br one potentially weak spot way magnetic fastener close hold sure would stay shut totally protect phone holding front cover place dropped bounced frankly courage drop test note 3 tradeoff convenience magnetic fastener without interfering spen know snap style fastener quickly wear evident bear motion case comparing thisbr br fact note 3 case going forward unless something even better come along say love look feel assurance superb protection personally one worth every penny premium price already elicited compliment,positive,2014,Phone Case

4.0,"It’s ok…fits well, but I believe  protection claims are overstated.","BEASTEK for iPhone 12 Waterproof Case is an ok case for the price and intent.  I got this for my 13 year old Son’s phone.  I like having a robust case given his age and the mag safe feature is something he had been wanting.  The extent of protection as claimed in the ad I question though.<br /><br />My two major complaints would be the plastic liner that covers the switch to cycle silent mode.  The plastic linear works so far and currently is “water resistant” but over time I believe this could be a failure point.  Second is the muffled sound. This hinders quality but I expected there would be a lose in speaker sound quality due to design.  You can’t cover a speaker that emits sounds waves that vibrate and not expect a drop in quality.<br /><br />Material used for the is case is average. The case itself is not bulky and feels good in my hand.  I have a tempered glass screen protector on his phone and  the case works fine even with the built in one.  He has had no degraded touch capabilities.  Charging the phone works with no issue on a mag safe and regular wireless charger.<br /><br />Picture/video quality appears the same as without the lens covers. However, smudges will appear on lens covers.  Be aware of this prior to taking pictures or videos.<br /><br />Overall, it is an ok case that provides protection.  I have had no issues as of yet with design or functionality however, my biggest gripe…does the level of protection meet the stated claims in the ad. I do not know nor do I want to find out.  None are substantiated by quantitative data.<br /><br />Value wise the price is appropriate based on design and quality.  I have no issues with that.<br /><br />Interesting info to better inform others.<br /><br />They use the term waterproof but the rating referenced “IP68” uses the term water resistant and only to 1.5 meters (4 feet 11 inches) for 30 minutes.  It is water resistant as I tested in my sink but as stated in the ad I would not want to find out if it meets the claimed depth.<br /><br />Per ad “Safe in water under 33ft even after 1000 times test of using for one hour exceeding IP68 rating, great protection for any underwater activities or outdoor/daily use”.<br /><br />Also, I believe the case does provide drop protection.  Whether it was dropped 1000 times from 9ft and survived as stated…I will believe it when they provide me the test report.  FYI, 810G, method 516 is shock testing and not stated is which procedure was used for the testing.  Was it functional shock, transport shock?  I can tell you the test specification do not call out dropping the test article 1000 times no matter what procedure is used.

5.0,Better Built than the Average Monopod,"There are two different kinds of “selfie sticks” (also called monopods). Most are Bluetooth devices that connect to the phone and operate the phone shutter via remote in the handle. These monopods require occasional recharging though the battery life is lengthy. The other kind plugs into the audio jack of the phone and the button operates the shutter via wire. There is no battery and all power comes via the audio jack. This particular monopod is of the latter type and it works well, though I do have an Android phone that will not work properly with it (not unexpected, see below).<br /><br />This monopod is similar in design to most others; it is a telescoping rod with a base for attaching the harness on the end and it has a rubberized handle with a covered button. Where it differs, though, is in the quality of the rod which is a bit better than average and it is definitely sturdy enough to support the phone without bending. This actually needs to be emphasized as I have seen some monopods with very weak rods that flex a little too easily.<br /><br />The audio jack cable extends from under the base at the end of the rod and has some flex to it that allows it to attach to almost any size phone without too much trouble. Because the cable is coiled it will retract into the rod if the base is pulled off so exercise a little caution when extending. That said, the base is well attached so there should be no issue if the monopod is not abused.<br /><br />I tried this monopod with three devices. The first was a Windows Phone which is not listed amongst the supported devices, the second was a Kyocera phone running the right version of Android and the third was a Sony Xperia Z running Android. The Windows phone was a flop as expected, and when the button on the monopod was pressed it turned up the volume on the phone. With the Kyocera phone, pressing the button caused the image to zoom in. This is a problematic phone and has not worked with any monopod I have tried, Bluetooth or otherwise. With the Sony, the action worked as expected and pressing the button caused the shutter to snap. This is exactly the same behavior I have observed with these three devices and other monopods of this type. So, it is safe to say it works with a majority of Android phones and it does not work at all with the Windows phone. It was worth a try.<br /><br />This is a nice monopod, better than others of its type that I have used. It is more solidly build than average and has a good, firm telescoping rod and it is assembled well. If you want a monopod and you want/need to avoid Bluetooth, this is a fine choice.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review.

1.0,Great in Concept but Unreliable in Fact,"When I test products to review I do so over a few months in order to provide a review that presents the best possible picture of what you can expect from your purchase.  This product is a perfect example of why I do this.<br /><br />Initially I thought this was an excellent product.  A single cable that would serve to charge multiple devices.

4.0,Great sounding paperweight,"I received this as a free review sample and am only half joking about the paperweight part. It it heavy and if you are working out on a patio it actually is heavy enough to hold papers down in a stiff breeze.<br /><br />However, sound is the key reason why I rated it so highly. This one is biased towards the mid range - and in a wide frequency band that reaches a little into the highs and lows. The high end is nice and full, and the bass is the same. The bass is not in-your-face, but it's respectable, even with modern, bass-centric music.<br /><br />Volume is decent, but this is a speaker that you will want no farther away than two meters and preferably one. That range is perfect for a night stand or desk.<br /><br />The subtracted star is for spotty bluetooth range. Normally I am near this speaker, but if I am on the phone and wander even a few meters away the sound quality can take a dive. I am guessing that the receiver is either extra shielded by foil internally, or the heavy metal case is the culprit. Regardless, it's a limitation for folks who tend to wander away from the speaker.<br /><br />Pairing and connecting are a snap, so that is yet another reason why I still rated it so highly, and I did get five and a half solid hours of continuous play with the speaker cranked to max. That is impressive and another contributing factor to my high rating.",2015-04-07 01:41:30,0,False,great sounding paperweight,received free review sample half joking paperweight part heavy working patio actually heavy enough hold paper stiff breezebr br however sound key reason rated highly one biased towards mid range wide frequency band reach little high low high end nice full bass bass inyourface respectable even modern basscentric musicbr br volume decent speaker want farther away two meter preferably one range perfect night stand deskbr br subtracted star spotty bluetooth range normally near speaker phone wander even meter away sound quality take dive guessing receiver either extra shielded foil internally heavy metal case culprit regardless limitation folk tend wander away speakerbr br pairing connecting snap yet another reason still rated highly get five half solid hour continuous play speaker cranked max impressive another contributing factor high rating,great sounding paperweight received free review sample half joking paperweight part heavy working patio actually heavy enough hold paper stiff breezebr br however sound key reason rated highly one biased towards mid range wide frequency band reach little high low high end nice full bass bass inyourface respectable even modern basscentric musicbr br volume decent speaker want farther away two meter preferably one range perfect night stand deskbr br subtracted star spotty bluetooth range normally near speaker phone wander even meter away sound quality take dive guessing receiver either extra shielded foil internally heavy metal case culprit regardless limitation folk tend wander away speakerbr br pairing connecting snap yet another reason still rated highly get five half solid hour continuous play speaker cranked max impressive another contributing factor high rating,positive,2015,Phone Case

5.0,Case Back Sparkles in Light As If Animated,"This OTTERBOX SYMMETRY CLEAR SERIES “STARDUST” CASE (for Samsung Galaxy S8+; Silver Flake/Clear) looks wonderful on my “Arctic Silver” Galaxy S8+ phone.  The back really sparkles, and the “stars” seem to move (as if animated) with only the slightest movement of the phone in your hand.<br /><br />The back of the case is clear plastic with silver flakes; the bumper that surrounds the phone is silvery gray.  This case would be positively gorgeous if the bumper were completely clear.  (Any color at all in the bumper interferes a little with the “unbox your phone” concept of the curved-edge Galaxy S8+.)<br /><br />Because I carry my S8+ in a holster case (see [[ASIN:B00OMODOYO leatherette case]]), an Otterbox Symmetry series case provides adequate protection for short drops and scratches.  The back of the phone is completely covered, and the rubber bumper is built up at the top and bottom so that the phone can be laid face down with care.<br /><br />The Symmetry case doesn't add much bulk, or extra weight.  It is easily removed from the phone (which is necessary if you want to use the Galaxy S8+ phone's oddly shaped, wide-shouldered Type C USB to USB cable adapter for transferring files by cable).  The bumper has raised “buttons” over the phone's buttons, rather than cutouts for the buttons.",2017-05-17 15:45:36,36,True,case back sparkle light animated,otterbox symmetry clear series stardust case samsung galaxy s8 silver flakeclear look wonderful arctic silver galaxy s8 phone back really sparkle star seem move animated slightest movement phone handbr br back case clear plastic silver flake bumper surround phone silvery gray case would positively gorgeous bumper completely clear color bumper interferes little unbox phone concept curvededge galaxy s8br br carry s8 holster case see asinb00omodoyo leatherette case otterbox symmetry series case provides adequate protection short drop scratch back phone completely covered rubber bumper built top bottom phone laid face carebr br symmetry case doesnt add much bulk extra weight easily removed phone necessary want use galaxy s8 phone oddly shaped wideshouldered type c usb usb cable adapter transferring file cable bumper raised button phone button rather cutout button,case back sparkle light animated otterbox symmetry clear series stardust case samsung galaxy s8 silver flakeclear look wonderful arctic silver galaxy s8 phone back really sparkle star seem move animated slightest movement phone handbr br back case clear plastic silver flake bumper surround phone silvery gray case would positively gorgeous bumper completely clear color bumper interferes little unbox phone concept curvededge galaxy s8br br carry s8 holster case see asinb00omodoyo leatherette case otterbox symmetry series case provides adequate protection short drop scratch back phone completely covered rubber bumper built top bottom phone laid face carebr br symmetry case doesnt add much bulk extra weight easily removed phone necessary want use galaxy s8 phone oddly shaped wideshouldered type c usb usb cable adapter transferring file cable bumper raised button phone button rather cutout button,positive,2017,Phone Case

4.0,Five star product with terrible documentation,"Out of the box the review sample that I received was initially frustrating. There were no instructions, and even the scant ones on the retail box were not exactly helpful. Before I go too deeply into that experience I'll describe this light.<br /><br />It's basically a small, bright flashlight that runs off or an internal battery that charges from a standard 5V wall of car charger. Although it has a 3.5mm connector, that does not provide electrical signals - it's a convenient way to mount the light on devices that have a 3.5mm port.<br /><br />There is an optional mount adapter that is designed for iPhones, but I clipped it on to my Galaxy Note 3 and it worked. This is where the confusion lies because it ships with the light inserted into that mount's rail. In the absence of real instructions I had no idea how to make it work. This product page contained the real clues, and I finally figured it out by coming here. Had I given this as a gift it would have confused the recipient, and that is why I gave it four stars.<br /><br />The lights are bright and this will make a big difference if you are using your phone for photography. Or you can slip it from the iPhone mount and use it as a pocket flashlight. In that role it's super bright and does an excellent job of illuminating. It also works perfectly as a workbench light for close, detailed work or inspection (I restore vintage fountain pens and it's ideal for that.)<br /><br />Bottom line: the only thing standing in the way of a five star rating is better instructions.

4.0,Great-looking case that complements your iPhone 6,"I preordered mine and received it on Sept. 19, the same day my iPhone 6 arrived. The color (I chose champagne / champagne) matches the phone perfectly. The case is very light with a sleek profile that makes you forget it's a case at all. Finishing is excellent; there are no rough seams, corners, or edges. After reading that several people had issues with Elago Outfit cases scratching their iPhone 5, I left the protective film on the back of my phone just in case, but don't plan on removing this case until I trade my phone in in a year or two.<br /><br />At first, I was worried that the thin plastic around the volume / power button might crack, but I've been using it for a month and it is as sturdy as the day I put it on the phone. There is also supposed to be a special coating that repels dirt and fingerprints, and I've been setting my phone down on multiple surfaces and it looks brand-new. If you see smudges / fingerprints on the aluminum panel, simply wipe down with a soft cloth and you're good to go.<br /><br />The one design feature I'm not crazy about is the fact that the top is left open; the bottom gives plenty of access to the speaker, headphone jack and adapter, and clearly Elago knew the power button had shifted from the top to the right, so I'm a bit confused why the top edge was left completely unprotected, as it seems likely that this is the surface that will hit first when dropped. The case does have a slight lip on the front, so you can set your phone face-down without worries about scratching the screen, but having the top edge enclosed would have made this a great case (so far the phone hasn't gotten scratched on the exposed edge, but I've been pretty careful with it).<br /><br />Things I like:<br />+ The case is made in Korea, not China.<br />+ Elago wrote a follow-up e-mail to ask how I liked my purchase.<br />+ Elago included several free gifts (a screen protector, cleaning cloth, and a car charger adapter) and a thank you note!<br />+ Smooth finishing (edges, corners, inside) means less chance of scratching your phone<br /><br />Things I'd improve:<br />- Enclose the top edge; since there are no buttons / jacks on top anymore, I can't see a reason for leaving the top edge of your phone / screen exposed to drops / cracks / scratches.<br /><br />Otherwise this is an excellent case and I would definitely recommend it!",2014-10-25 12:56:10,1,True,greatlooking case complement iphone 6,preordered mine received sept 19 day iphone 6 arrived color chose champagne champagne match phone perfectly case light sleek profile make forget case finishing excellent rough seam corner edge reading several people issue elago outfit case scratching iphone 5 left protective film back phone case dont plan removing case trade phone year twobr br first worried thin plastic around volume power button might crack ive using month sturdy day put phone also supposed special coating repels dirt fingerprint ive setting phone multiple surface look brandnew see smudge fingerprint aluminum panel simply wipe soft cloth youre good gobr br one design feature im crazy fact top left open bottom give plenty access speaker headphone jack adapter clearly elago knew power button shifted top right im bit confused top edge left completely unprotected seems likely surface hit first dropped case slight lip front set phone facedown without worry scratching screen top edge enclosed would made great case far phone hasnt gotten scratched exposed edge ive pretty careful itbr br thing likebr case made korea chinabr elago wrote followup email ask liked purchasebr elago included several free gift screen protector cleaning cloth car charger adapter thank notebr smooth finishing edge corner inside mean less chance scratching phonebr br thing id improvebr enclose top edge since button jack top anymore cant see reason leaving top edge phone screen exposed drop crack scratchesbr br otherwise excellent case would definitely recommend,greatlooking case complement iphone 6 preordered mine received sept 19 day iphone 6 arrived color chose champagne champagne match phone perfectly case light sleek profile make forget case finishing excellent rough seam corner edge reading several people issue elago outfit case scratching iphone 5 left protective film back phone case dont plan removing case trade phone year twobr br first worried thin plastic around volume power button might crack ive using month sturdy day put phone also supposed special coating repels dirt fingerprint ive setting phone multiple surface look brandnew see smudge fingerprint aluminum panel simply wipe soft cloth youre good gobr br one design feature im crazy fact top left open bottom give plenty access speaker headphone jack adapter clearly elago knew power button shifted top right im bit confused top edge left completely unprotected seems likely surface hit first dropped case slight lip front set phone facedown without worry scratching screen top edge enclosed would made great case far phone hasnt gotten scratched exposed edge ive pretty careful itbr br thing likebr case made korea chinabr elago wrote followup email ask liked purchasebr elago included several free gift screen protector cleaning cloth car charger adapter thank notebr smooth finishing edge corner inside mean less chance scratching phonebr br thing id improvebr enclose top edge since button jack top anymore cant see reason leaving top edge phone screen exposed drop crack scratchesbr br otherwise excellent case would definitely recommend,positive,2014,Phone Case

5.0,Great quality phone stand! Please read my review fully though.,"At first, I was prepared to receive a low quality phone stand because of the price, which was around $10. I originally thought that maybe it would’ve been a hard plastic type, but I couldn’t have been more wrong. The moment I opened up the package, I was at an awe. I absolutely love mine! I was very impressed with the quality of this product. It’s all metal and very sturdy. I use this all of the time. It is difficult to move when adjusting, but it’s a good difficult because when you position it to the angle you want, it stays in its place until you physically move it again. You can easily type on your phone without the phone budging. I bought this in Rose Gold to match the color of my iPhone 7 Plus. There was one thing that I noticed that could be improved. I ended up purchasing a small piece of rubber from a craft store and I cut th piece to the size of the bottom (just a little less on all sides so that the rubber doesn’t hang off the sides and to collect debris. Anyway, I glued it on the bottom of the stand so that I could also do Facebook Live videos and still be able to type comments without the stand sliding on desks, counter tops or any other smooth surfaces. It also helps in the kitchen while you’re working on dinner and on Allrecipes and only have one free “clean” finger so that you can scroll down the ingredients to the recipe without the stand moving.

4.0,Worthwhile investment,"This is a very sturdy screen protector that fits neatly over the face of an iPhone 5 and then virtually disappears. The touch screen remains completely accessible, and you won't even know the protector is there until the phone takes a tumble and survives.<br /><br />The package also includes a wet wipe for cleaning the screen to prep it for installation, a small microfiber cloth, a plastic squeegee for removing air bubbles and two aluminium buttons (one black and one silver) for covering the home button. (The screen protector doesn't cover the home button, leaving it in a slight depression, so these buttons are to fill the space and cheer it up)<br /><br />You'll need to be careful when aligning the protector during installation, as you don't get a second chance to get it right without causing air bubbles or discoloration that the squeegee can't get out. The instructions are very easy - it's the steady hand required to line it up that causes problems.<br /><br />If you're going to use the aluminium button to cover the home button, place it before applying the protective screen, which makes everything easier to align.  I found that the sensitivity of the home button was reduced, and getting it off again is very difficult without messing up the protector, so test it first before applying the screen.<br /><br />My only problem is that even though it's not very thick, that extra layer prevents me from using my three-in-one photo lens attachment, which I use regularly, being a photo-fanatic.<br /><br />A wonderful investment to protect your expensive phone from cracks and scratches, but the extra thickness may cause some problems with accessories.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, October 4, 2013",2013-10-04 20:06:11,0,False,worthwhile investment,sturdy screen protector fit neatly face iphone 5 virtually disappears touch screen remains completely accessible wont even know protector phone take tumble survivesbr br package also includes wet wipe cleaning screen prep installation small microfiber cloth plastic squeegee removing air bubble two aluminium button one black one silver covering home button screen protector doesnt cover home button leaving slight depression button fill space cheer upbr br youll need careful aligning protector installation dont get second chance get right without causing air bubble discoloration squeegee cant get instruction easy steady hand required line cause problemsbr br youre going use aluminium button cover home button place applying protective screen make everything easier align found sensitivity home button reduced getting difficult without messing protector test first applying screenbr br problem even though thick extra layer prevents using threeinone photo lens attachment use regularly photofanaticbr br wonderful investment protect expensive phone crack scratch extra thickness may cause problem accessoriesbr br amanda richards october 4 2013,worthwhile investment sturdy screen protector fit neatly face iphone 5 virtually disappears touch screen remains completely accessible wont even know protector phone take tumble survivesbr br package also includes wet wipe cleaning screen prep installation small microfiber cloth plastic squeegee removing air bubble two aluminium button one black one silver covering home button screen protector doesnt cover home button leaving slight depression button fill space cheer upbr br youll need careful aligning protector installation dont get second chance get right without causing air bubble discoloration squeegee cant get instruction easy steady hand required line cause problemsbr br youre going use aluminium button cover home button place applying protective screen make everything easier align found sensitivity home button reduced getting difficult without messing protector test first applying screenbr br problem even though thick extra layer prevents using threeinone photo lens attachment use regularly photofanaticbr br wonderful investment protect expensive phone crack scratch extra thickness may cause problem accessoriesbr br amanda richards october 4 2013,positive,2013,Screen Protector

4.0,An honest review!,"So first of all, I originally had pictures to go with this, but Amazon's review system has been having trouble approving reviews with pictures lately. I'm re-writing this review without pictures this time in order to make sure it doesn't get stuck in limbo again. So y'all will have to use your imagination a little more!<br /><br />This is a pretty great case for a Galaxy S4. As you can see in the product description and photos, it has two parts: a smaller half-shell case for the actual phone, and a larger belt holster that it securely slides into. When the phone is inserted into the holster, it is fairly well protected on all sides. The holster is actually REVERSIBLE as well, which means you can insert your phone facing outwards or inwards. What is interesting about this setup, is that you can actually use the rotating belt clip part as a kickstand using this nifty metal clip in the middle of it to hold it up (wish I could show the picture for this). But to be perfectly honest, there's very little reason I can think of to do this since the smaller inner case has its own kickstand already, and using it facing outward in the holster doesn't actually offer any additional protection. It just does the same think but bulkier!<br /><br />Speaking of which, one that I didn't like about this case is that without the whole thing slid into the holster, there really is only protection on the back and part of the sides of your phone. A lot of the edges are open and unprotected, especailly the top and bottom edges, which is unfortunately the part that is prone to knicks/dents if it falls. That being said, the small inner case might not offer as much protection as a silicone wrap style one, but it does at least make the phone less slippery to hold in your hand since it is a rubberized plastic shell. I actually like that, since you not only get to have a kickstand, you also get the non-slip and scratch deterrent of rubber/silicone, while also have the dent protection of hard plastic. Oh yeah, and the kickstand works in both portrait and landscape orientations.<br /><br />Things I didn't like:<br />-I've already mentioned that without the holster, it feels like the front and edges of my phone aren't really protected. If you want something like an Otter Box, look elsewhere (this is way thinner though).<br />-The inner case is a bit difficult to remove quickly for battery swaps. I actually have 3 spare batteries I like to keep on tap so I never have to charge, and I always feel like I have to bend the shell to almost the point it might break to get the phone out. I'm not sure if it is designed to withstand doing that on a regular basis.<br />-When using the phone in the holster, it effectively blocks access to the USB port for charging. You can't keep the holster on it while charging.<br /><br />That's the worst I can think of. Everything else is pretty great about it. I love the kickstand and the rubberized hard plastic. To be fair, I did receive this at a discount in return for my review. I do my best to be completely honest about the things I review, and for the retail price, I think it deserves 4 stars.",2016-08-03 19:03:55,0,False,honest review,first originally picture go amazon review system trouble approving review picture lately im rewriting review without picture time order make sure doesnt get stuck limbo yall use imagination little morebr br pretty great case galaxy s4 see product description photo two part smaller halfshell case actual phone larger belt holster securely slide phone inserted holster fairly well protected side holster actually reversible well mean insert phone facing outwards inwards interesting setup actually use rotating belt clip part kickstand using nifty metal clip middle hold wish could show picture perfectly honest there little reason think since smaller inner case kickstand already using facing outward holster doesnt actually offer additional protection think bulkierbr br speaking one didnt like case without whole thing slid holster really protection back part side phone lot edge open unprotected especailly top bottom edge unfortunately part prone knicksdents fall said small inner case might offer much protection silicone wrap style one least make phone less slippery hold hand since rubberized plastic shell actually like since get kickstand also get nonslip scratch deterrent rubbersilicone also dent protection hard plastic oh yeah kickstand work portrait landscape orientationsbr br thing didnt likebr ive already mentioned without holster feel like front edge phone arent really protected want something like otter box look elsewhere way thinner thoughbr inner case bit difficult remove quickly battery swap actually 3 spare battery like keep tap never charge always feel like bend shell almost point might break get phone im sure designed withstand regular basisbr using phone holster effectively block access usb port charging cant keep holster chargingbr br thats worst think everything else pretty great love kickstand rubberized hard plastic fair receive discount return review best completely honest thing review retail price think deserves 4 star,honest review first originally picture go amazon review system trouble approving review picture lately im rewriting review without picture time order make sure doesnt get stuck limbo yall use imagination little morebr br pretty great case galaxy s4 see product description photo two part smaller halfshell case actual phone larger belt holster securely slide phone inserted holster fairly well protected side holster actually reversible well mean insert phone facing outwards inwards interesting setup actually use rotating belt clip part kickstand using nifty metal clip middle hold wish could show picture perfectly honest there little reason think since smaller inner case kickstand already using facing outward holster doesnt actually offer additional protection think bulkierbr br speaking one didnt like case without whole thing slid holster really protection back part side phone lot edge open unprotected especailly top bottom edge unfortunately part prone knicksdents fall said small inner case might offer much protection silicone wrap style one least make phone less slippery hold hand since rubberized plastic shell actually like since get kickstand also get nonslip scratch deterrent rubbersilicone also dent protection hard plastic oh yeah kickstand work portrait landscape orientationsbr br thing didnt likebr ive already mentioned without holster feel like front edge phone arent really protected want something like otter box look elsewhere way thinner thoughbr inner case bit difficult remove quickly battery swap actually 3 spare battery like keep tap never charge always feel like bend shell almost point might break get phone im sure designed withstand regular basisbr using phone holster effectively block access usb port charging cant keep holster chargingbr br thats worst think everything else pretty great love kickstand rubberized hard plastic fair receive discount return review best completely honest thing review retail price think deserves 4 star,positive,2016,Phone Case

5.0,Perfect.,"I use amFilm for all my modern screens. I use it on my phone, my wife uses it on hers, our daughter's iPad, our Switch--you name it. When I ordered my Pocket from the initial pre-order, I didn't order anything else, regrettably. Looking back, I wish I would've ordered the screen protector and GG adapter, but I was in such a rush to get my pre-order locked.<br />I digress.<br /><br />What I love about amFilm is I get two quality glass screens at an incredibly reasonable price. When amFilm first posted the protectors, they were 9.99 USD for a pack; just a few days later, when I placed my order, the price increased to 11.99 USD. But even at the 2 USD increase, the price is more than justified. The pack comes with the usual: two glass screens, screen-cleaning supplies, and an installation guide. The latter may seem trivial, but I've always referred to it to ensure I get proper installation. Since the time I received the Pocket, I kept the factory plastic protector on the screen. When I was ready to apply the amFilm protector, I simply removed the plastic screen and applied the amFilm protector within seconds. The protector comes with two removable, plastic tabs on either side to aid in application. So far, no noticeable dust or particles. Sweet.<br /><br />The screen protector is so smooth it feels like water. With other devices like the Switch and our mobile devices, this sheen doesn't last long due to constant interaction with skin. I hope, at least, that the Pocket's silky-smooth layer stays on longer. I notice no difference in color between the previous plastic protector and this amFilm one. The edges are rounded off, which looks very handsome on the Pocket. It's like a bubble flattened as much as possible without popping.

2.0,"Solid, nice looking case - but minimal, if any, screen protection.","I have tried, tested and reviewed more phone cases than I can remember at this point.  This is the first Emerge Case I’ve had the opportunity to review and it definitely has some strong points but it also misses the mark in a few critical aspects.<br /><br />Firstly, it fits my iPhone 8 Plus perfectly - all buttons work, switches are easily accessible, cable ports free of obstacle and sound ports are unobstructed.<br /><br />The case is definitely hard and withstood our stress tests without issue.  Emerge utilizes a honeycomb pattern with their plastic manufacturing of this case making it extremely rigid and strong. The corners are reinforced and would provide adequate protection if impacted there.<br /><br />The black and silver is a classic, clean look that will always be in style.<br /><br />While Emerge bills this as a Grip Case our tests found that this case is actually harder to grip than any of the other 5 we tested.  While there is a slight texture cut into the surface the material is hard and tends to slide from the hand while rubberized materials stick.<br /><br />Another area of concern is that this case is nearly completely flush with the LCD glass screen of the phone - providing no protection from a flat face fall.  This fact alone, unfortunately, makes this case a non contender as to one I’d recommend for protection.<br /><br />The LCD glass is the number one thing damaged on mobile phones and should be a primary area any good case protects - this one fails.<br /><br />While this is a really nice looking case and will protect in corner and rear impacts it will not protect the LCD glass screen in any impact to the front.",2019-05-10 16:15:38,3,False,solid nice looking case minimal screen protection,tried tested reviewed phone case remember point first emerge case ive opportunity review definitely strong point also miss mark critical aspectsbr br firstly fit iphone 8 plus perfectly button work switch easily accessible cable port free obstacle sound port unobstructedbr br case definitely hard withstood stress test without issue emerge utilizes honeycomb pattern plastic manufacturing case making extremely rigid strong corner reinforced would provide adequate protection impacted therebr br black silver classic clean look always stylebr br emerge bill grip case test found case actually harder grip 5 tested slight texture cut surface material hard tends slide hand rubberized material stickbr br another area concern case nearly completely flush lcd glass screen phone providing protection flat face fall fact alone unfortunately make case non contender one id recommend protectionbr br lcd glass number one thing damaged mobile phone primary area good case protects one failsbr br really nice looking case protect corner rear impact protect lcd glass screen impact front,solid nice looking case minimal screen protection tried tested reviewed phone case remember point first emerge case ive opportunity review definitely strong point also miss mark critical aspectsbr br firstly fit iphone 8 plus perfectly button work switch easily accessible cable port free obstacle sound port unobstructedbr br case definitely hard withstood stress test without issue emerge utilizes honeycomb pattern plastic manufacturing case making extremely rigid strong corner reinforced would provide adequate protection impacted therebr br black silver classic clean look always stylebr br emerge bill grip case test found case actually harder grip 5 tested slight texture cut surface material hard tends slide hand rubberized material stickbr br another area concern case nearly completely flush lcd glass screen phone providing protection flat face fall fact alone unfortunately make case non contender one id recommend protectionbr br lcd glass number one thing damaged mobile phone primary area good case protects one failsbr br really nice looking case protect corner rear impact protect lcd glass screen impact front,positive,2019,Phone Case

3.0,palm rejection and that's about all.,"This basic stylus for the ipad is only slightly better than a pen with a capacitive tip, really.  There is no pressure sensitivity, no tilt sensitivity, and no soft tip for a paper feel.  The advantage that it has over a standard capacitive pen is that it is more accure, but then you don't need to charge a capacitive pen.<br /><br />This stylus comes with three tips but that's really just for show.  You will never wear the tip out because it is hard plastic and doesn't have any sort of paper-like feel.  It takes a little getting used to because I prefer more friction when I'm writing and so my handwriting isn't quite the same as when I write on pen-and-paper.<br /><br />If you don't want to spend $100 on an original Apple and you don't need any of the fancy tilt and pressure sensors, this will work just fine for you.

4.0,Nice features for an inexpensive light - do have one concern,"I received this as a free review sample. To begin, Daniel G. Lebryk's June 10, 2015 covers this light in depth and I will attempt to avoid repeating his helpful information.<br /><br />This is not my first lightweight DMX style light, but it's the first that I have owned and used that is sound activated. The sound activation is a little tricky. It only responds to low frequeny signals, so unless you have subs or are biasing your mix heavily towards bass this light may not respond to sound. For the music I play it does not work, but I will guess that if you are a DJ or running heavy bass music it's a feature you will love. Of course this has DMX in and out connectors, so you can daisy-chain this light off of a controller.<br /><br />For folks like myself who use minimal effects with no DMX controller the back panel is an effective way to set your displays. Be aware that with the combinations and permutations of lighting styles and the 255 steps each for the Red,Green and Blue combinations it can be time consuming to set up. Especially when you have a single step up/down key to get to the settings. Fortunately you can stick with the program and mode features and get some attractive, basic displays, which is how I use this light. If you do decide to use a DMX controller and do not yet own one a good starter controller is the [[ASIN:B004STXY3E American Dj Supply RGB3C RGB Led Controller With Built In Colors And Shows]]. It's overkill for a single light, but if you are planning to purchase more than one of these lights it will greatly simplify setting them up and managing them.<br /><br />It comes with a bail that allows you to hang it or use it as a floor stand. Since this is a fairly lightweight and cool running light it is not going to overheat for shows up to five hours, nor will it or even a dozen of them, contribute to stage temperatures. I love that characteristic.<br /><br />One note about the UK style plug and the US style adapter: then I plug in or unplug I observed sparking. That is a concern and a reason why I subtracted a star. The culprit may be the adapter itself and not the light, but I did not have a spare laying around to confirm that. Since safety is paramount I need to highlight this as a potential issue that you should factor in when making a purchase decision.",2015-06-14 14:03:31,1,False,nice feature inexpensive light one concern,received free review sample begin daniel g lebryks june 10 2015 cover light depth attempt avoid repeating helpful informationbr br first lightweight dmx style light first owned used sound activated sound activation little tricky responds low frequeny signal unless sub biasing mix heavily towards bass light may respond sound music play work guess dj running heavy bass music feature love course dmx connector daisychain light controllerbr br folk like use minimal effect dmx controller back panel effective way set display aware combination permutation lighting style 255 step redgreen blue combination time consuming set especially single step updown key get setting fortunately stick program mode feature get attractive basic display use light decide use dmx controller yet one good starter controller asinb004stxy3e american dj supply rgb3c rgb led controller built color show overkill single light planning purchase one light greatly simplify setting managing thembr br come bail allows hang use floor stand since fairly lightweight cool running light going overheat show five hour even dozen contribute stage temperature love characteristicbr br one note uk style plug u style adapter plug unplug observed sparking concern reason subtracted star culprit may adapter light spare laying around confirm since safety paramount need highlight potential issue factor making purchase decision,nice feature inexpensive light one concern received free review sample begin daniel g lebryks june 10 2015 cover light depth attempt avoid repeating helpful informationbr br first lightweight dmx style light first owned used sound activated sound activation little tricky responds low frequeny signal unless sub biasing mix heavily towards bass light may respond sound music play work guess dj running heavy bass music feature love course dmx connector daisychain light controllerbr br folk like use minimal effect dmx controller back panel effective way set display aware combination permutation lighting style 255 step redgreen blue combination time consuming set especially single step updown key get setting fortunately stick program mode feature get attractive basic display use light decide use dmx controller yet one good starter controller asinb004stxy3e american dj supply rgb3c rgb led controller built color show overkill single light planning purchase one light greatly simplify setting managing thembr br come bail allows hang use floor stand since fairly lightweight cool running light going overheat show five hour even dozen contribute stage temperature love characteristicbr br one note uk style plug u style adapter plug unplug observed sparking concern reason subtracted star culprit may adapter light spare laying around confirm since safety paramount need highlight potential issue factor making purchase decision,positive,2015,Screen Protector
